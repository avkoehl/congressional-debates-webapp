Mr. BECK obtained the floor.
Mr. WOOD. Mr. Speaker, by permission of
the gentleman from Kentucky, [Mr. Beck,] 1
rise merely to make a remark with reference
to this word of which we now hear so much—
"syndicate." 1 do not propose to discuss
the question immediately before the House,
because it is in the charge of far abler hands
who will undoubtedly exhaust all that can be
said against the adoption of this report from
the Committee of Ways and Means. _ But
however much we may properly complain of
the conduct of the Treasury Department in its
management of this loan, I think we may thank
it for the introduction of a new word, so far as
this country is concerned, in reference to fiscal
negotiations.
The word " syndicate " is. I think, very un-
familiar to American ears. There probably are
men evetl iti this Souse who do hot compre-
hend the Eiirnpeart definition and acceptation
of that Word. '' Syndicate'' meand a Cdihbitia-
tion of syndics. We hear of'' tings'' here plen-
tifully. .We have "rings" in this country for
every conceivable object, good, bad, tod indif-
ferent. ButinEurope a "syndicate" tneans a
council of syndics; and "syndic" in Prance,
where the word practically originated, although
it is of both Greek and Latin derivation, taeans
a corps of Officers to administer upon the
effects of bankrupts. I Suppose that when the
Secretary of the Tr6a3ury deemed it ilecessary
to carry into European bankihg cir'fcles the
bankrupt bonds of the United States,- placing
theta there to be sold at a depreciation, pay-
ing bankers ati extraordinary, and, in toy judg-
ment, an illegal rate of interest under the guisS
of a commission, to induce thetn to take the
bonds, he thought the most appropriate -*ord
to use in hawking our credit in the Buropfeail
market, virtually at a discount and at- a dis-
honored price, would be "syndicate." 1 find
in Webster's Unabridged Dictionary that this
word " syndicate" is defined as "a council Or
body of syndics ; " and under (he word " syn-
dic" I find the following: "In France syndids
are appointed by the creditors of a bankrupt to
manage the property." Hence, sir, hoivever
much we may complain of the management of
this loan, we certainly may thank the Secretary
for giving us a word so directly pertinent and
applicable in view of the depreciation of Amer-
ican credit abroad under his administration.
Mr. DAWES. Will the gentleman yield to
me a moment?
Mr. BECK. Certainly.
Mr. DAWES, It is so important in the
discussion of this matter to settle this ques-
tion that the gentleman from New York [Mr.
Wood] has deemed it necessary to breaik the
eontinnity of the argument to show us his
learning about the word " syndicate," and at
thesame time thank the Treasury Department
for inventing it. I have to say in defense of
the Secretary of the Treasury, whatever it may
mean and wherever it originated, the credit of
it is not due to the Secretary or to the Treas-
ury Department, and you will not, find it in any
of these negotiations.
The geutleman from Indiana, [Mr. Kerr,]
who has just taken his seat, and my friend
from Kentucky, [Mr. Beck,] who is upon his
feet, have a list of everybody who subscribed
for these bonds. I am sure my friend from
New York [Mr. Wood] did not know that
every one of them was subscribed for in this
country, and by the national banks in this
country. At the Treasury Department nothing
is knowu of any other transaction except such
as they make with national banks of this coun-
try, created by the laws of this country, and
established and maintained by them.
Mr. BECK took the floor.
Mr. MAYNARD. Before the gentleman
proceeds, allow me to say a single word.
Mr. BECK. My colleague on the committee
will have ample time; but I will give way if
my colleague wishes it.
Mr. Mj£YNABD. I wish merely to say
in that connection that I hold Webster's Dic-
tionary in my hand, and a " syndic " is repre-
sented to be an officer of Government invested
with different powers in diffeient Governments;
also onechosento transact business for others.
Then follows a note which the gentleman from
New York alluded to. but which I tfill give.
In France syndics are appointed by the cred-
itors of a bankrupt to manage the property.
In Geneva the syndic is the chief magistrate.
Almost all the companies in Paris, the univer-
sity and the like, have their syndics. The Uni-
versity of Cambridge has its syndics, who are
chosen from the senate to transact special
business, as the regulation ot fees, framing
