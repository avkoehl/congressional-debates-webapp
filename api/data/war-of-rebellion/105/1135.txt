highly commendable. Colonel Lippitt has in his district ten companies of infantry and one of cavalry, and it was supposed that this force would be ample for the maintance of peace between the whites and Indians. Recent events show that although nearly 300 Indians have been collected at Fort Humboldt preparatory to their removal to the reservation, yet there is a band of determined warriors still acting in open hostility to the while people, and not until this band shall be subdued can peace and quiet be restored. I am informed that many men have left their families in that country and gone to the mines. This is to beregretted, as women and children thus left defenselss invite attacks from marauding bands of Indians. However, the volunteer soldiers of California will not turn a deaf ear to the appeals of helpless women and children thus bereft of their natural protectors, but go on battling with the savage foes until a permanent peace shall be obtained. Orders have been sent to the commander of the District of Oregon to send the three companies of Colonel Lippitt's regiment to Fort Humboldt as soon as they can be relieved by the Washington Territory Volunteers. One of the companies may beexpected down by the 25th instant. The others, being at a more remote station, will not reach Humboldt for some weeks. In conclusion, I beg to assure you, and the peole whom you represent, that I take a deep interest in maintaining peace in their country, and that no efforts on my part shall be wanting to afford them protection and security against their savage enemies.

With great respect, I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,

Colonel FRANCIS J. LIPPITT,

Second Infantry California Volunteers, Commanding District of Humboldt, Fort Humboldt, Cal.:

SIR: Your letter of the 10th instant giving a record of the military events in your district having been submitted to the general commanding the department, I am instructed to say that your action regarding the sending of troops to Round Valley is approved. The general cuations you against the twoo general distribution of your small force, and particularly the sending out of small detachments. Small parties invite attack from Indians, with a good prospect of success; and, if successful, it emboldens them for further outrages.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
