HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,May 30, 1864 - 4 p. m.

Lieutenant General U. S. GRANT,

Commanding:

GENERAL: A dispatch from Sheridan reports he drove the enemy's cavalry this afternoon, and now occupies Cold Harbor, Parsley's, and the cross-roads from Cold Harbor and Parsley's, connecting with Warren's left. I have advised him of Smith's movement, and told him to keep a sharp lookout for any movement of the enemy in that direction. I have not moved Wright.

Respectfully,

GEO. G. MEADE.

[Pencil indorsement.]

Major General W. F. Smith, commanding Eighteenth Army Corps, will report to, and receive orders from, Major General George G. Meade, commanding Army of the Potomac, until otherwise ordered.

NEAR HAW'S SHOP, VA.,

Major-General MEADE,

Commanding Army of the Potomac:

Is it not evident that the enemy's line is entirely to the left of General Wright's? If he is not already doing so, it seems to me that he should push forward his right as far as possible, holding connection with Hancock with his left.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

NEAR HAW'S SHOP, VA.,

May 30, 1864 - 6.40 p. m.

Major-General MEADE,

Commanding Army of the Potomac:

General Smith will debark his force at the White House to-might and sharp up the south bank of the Pamunkey, at an early hour, probably at 3 a. m. in the morning. It is not improbable that the enemy, being aware of Smith's movement, will be feeling to get on our left flank for the purpose of cutting him off, or by a dash to crush him and get back before we are aware of it. Sheridan ought to be notified to watch the enemy's movements well out toward Cold Harbor, and also the Mechanicsville road. Wright should be got well massed on Hancock's right so that if it becomes necessary he can take the place of the latter readily whiles troops are being thrown east of the Totopotomoy, if necessary. I want Sheridan to send a cavalry force of at least half a brigade, if not a whole brigade, at 5 o'clock in the morning, to communicate with Smith and to return with him. I will send orders for Smith by the messenger you send to Sheridan with his orders.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
