terms as other committees have been authorized
to employ clerks. The resolution is in these
words:
Resolved, That the Committee, on Public Buildings and
Gtounds be, and hereby are, authorized to employ a clerk
for so much of the piesent Congress as the majoiity of said
committee may consider expedient, at a per diem com-
pensation not to exceed four dollars per day, to be paid out
of the contingent fund of the House."

HEIRS OF ETHAN ALLEN.
Mr. SEWARD. I am desired to present to
the Senate the memorial of Ethan A. Allen,
Mary H. Weir, wife of Andrew Weir, and Ethan
Allen Hitchcock, grandchildren of Ethan Allen. ;
These persons are the heirs and representatives
of Colonel Ethan Allen, of revolutionary memory.
I desire to state to the Senate two facts which
appear in this petition. One of them is, that on
the 24th of September, 1778, a resolution was
passed by the Continental Congress in these
words:
Whereas, Congress did on the 14th of May tost, grant to
Ethan Allen the rank of Colonel by brevet in the Army of
the United Statos of America, in reward of bis fortitude,
firmness, and zeal in the cause of his country, manifested
daring the course of his long and cruel captivity, as well as
on former occasions: And whereas, on the 16th day of the
same month, all the benefits and privileges of a Lieutenant
Colonel in the services of these States were granted-to said
Ethan AHen during the time of his late captivity: And
whereas, it is represented to Congress that Colonel Ethan
Alien's circumstances have been greatly reduced by bis late
long and cruel confinement) and his brevet commission does
not entitle him to pay:
Resolved, That seventy-five dollars per month he allowed
to Colonel Allen, from the date of his brevet, during the
pleasure of Congress, or until he shall be called into actual
service.
The other fact is, that under that resolution of
September, 1778, there was due to him at the time
of his death, and which never has been paid, the
sum of $9,675, which his heirs and representa-
tives pray Congress may be paid. I move to
refer the petition, together with an explanatory
paper accompanying it, to the Committee on Rev-
olutionary Claims.
The motion was agreed to.
NAVAL RETIRING BOARD.
Mr. PEARCE presented the memorial of Isaac
S. Sterrett, a commander in the Navy, who has
been placed upon the reserved list, praying to be
restored to his former position in the service;
which was ordered to lie on the table.
Mr. WELLER. I present joint resolutions of
the Legislature of California in regard to the
action of the naval board in the cases of Lieu-
tenants Stanly and Stevens, of the Navy. The
Legislature of that State unanimously passed
these resolutions, disapproving of the action of
the board, so far as these two officers are con-
cerned. They were for a long timo in active
service on the Pacific coast; and, having had an
opportunity of knowing fully the character of
these officers, the Legislature of California has
felt it proper to pass these joint resolutions. 1
ask that the resolutions be read, and I then wish
to submit a few remarks.
The Secretary read the resolutions, as followe:
Resolved by the Senate, (the Assembly concurring,) That
the action of the boatd of Navy officers, under the act of
Congress " to piomote the efficiency of the Navy," approved
February 28,1855, in relation to Lieutenants Fabius Stanly
and T. H. Stevens, was not only unjust to those officers,
but injurious to the public service.
Resolved, That in consideration of the irreproachable
character of the said Fabius Stanly and Thomas H. Ste-
vens as citizens of this State, and of their well-known
good conduct and efficiency in their country's service, our
Senatois aie instructed, and our Representatives in Con-
fess are requested, to use all proper effoits to remedy the
injustice committed by the said board toward these officers,
and to icpair the injury which the action of the said board
is calculated to pioduce to the Navy of the United States*
PieM'iitcd unci passed, Febuiary 13,1856.
Attest: W. BAQSMAN, Secretary Senate.
Mr. WELLER. The action of the board,
in dropping from the rolls Lieutenant Thomas
Holdup Stevens, has caused much deep and pain-
ful feeling, both in and out of the service, it has
been productive of equal surprise and regret. His
brother officers who know him best, and his many
friends not connected with the Navy, in different
parts of the country, are satisfied that (however
unwittingly, or under whatsoever grave and lam-
entable misapprehension) signal injustice has
boen done him; and now that the Secretary of the
j Navy and the President have expressed them-
selves favorable to a correction of the errors ot
the board; (the former stating in his annual re-
port " that there should be and will be found a
remedy for any mistake or error of judgment, if
the service has thus been deprived of a merito-
rious and capable officer, either by reservation or
dropping,") now that the whole subjectis before
the Senate for revision, and, in cooperation wilh
the Executive, remedial actionâ€”they, Lieuten-
ant Stevens's friends, are desirous t,o leave no
proper eiforts untried to have his case fairly and
fully considered, in the sane conviction that its
investigation cannot fail to lead to such action as
will result m his restoration to his former posi-
tion m the Navy. They arc utterly at a loss how
to account for his being droppedâ€”the official
notification of which harsh condemnation found
him " unconscious of wrong, unwarned, unques-
tioned, and unsuspecting."
Lieutenant Stevens entered the service in 383G;
and the official Register for 1855 shows him to
have been, during a period of eighteen years'
service, some ten years at sea, and five years on
shore, or other duty. After a cruise of three
years, as midshipman, on board the United States
frigate Independence, Commodore Nicholson, he
