matters had been most unjustifiably abused, proof of which
was incontrovertible
What would be the effect of striking out all theitenis of con

tions, and the|genilemdn from New York [Mr Fillmore] had
thrown out the idea that the wholesome action of the Govern
mentandthe Oepattmeuts would he impeded Thisresult did
not necessarily follow It was not contended that this should
be the end ofthebsil Every man knew that contingent appi o

now was to tetcr the whole qucatioa to the Commutce of
Ways and Means wit \ mstiuctions to limit and define Exetu
Uve discretion as to <nese appropuations, to make them specific
as far as possible, and to reduce them so iar as wa  compatible
with the wplftte of ¡he Government
The gentleman fion Virginia [Mr Wise]had argued as if
this were an attack on h e Administration
[Mr. Wise was understood to say, "the proviso "]
Mr Gentry resumed What was the proviso but an effort
to control and regulate Executive discretion, and to secure the
transaction of the public business at the cheapest possible late?
What waq it but a pioviso similar to that foi whi< h the gentle
man himself voted in 1B39, and for which the whole Whig party
had hitherto contended* Was there any thing in this which
■was incompatible with the administration oí the laws of the
Government?   Surely not
But the gentteman had said this was an extraordinary move-
ruent, such as had not before bees seen Well, these weie ex-
traordinary times, and there was a  extraordinary necessity for
extraordinary efforts to c >nect those abuses of which the coun-
try had been complaining for years, and for the correction of
which, as he understood, both parties stood pledged, since both
had acknowledged the existence of abuses, and both had con
ceded the necessity of reform in them If they were now to
shrink from the task, as had been done, especially by the House
of Representatives lor years past, they would be guilty of a de-
gieeof that moral turpitude and political infidelity ol which
the present Executive of the nation had within the last ft w
months given u<j s ) notaba a specimen
But he would «ask the gentleman from Virginia what was
there different m the condition ol the Departments of ihe Go
ve-rnment now, from that which exited when that gentleman
declared that, with a committee ready disposed to examine into
these Departments and piobe their abuses he could eviacetate
facts which would be sufficient to impeach the President and
every head of every Department of the Government^ Had
things been reformed since then i

Mi G proceeded He w a& endeavoring to vindicate fhe party
of which he wa& an humble member—ot the party which had
been attacked ytaterday, m tht pet&on of Lite chairman of the
Committee of Ways and M^ans, who was chiiged with impro-
per motives for insisting on this lefoim, and which, he repeat
ed, they were all pledged to carry out, and none more so than
the gent'eman from Vugmia himself The thunder tones of that
gentleman's voice had reverberated over the bills and through
the valleys of the West, and had waked him (Mr G ) up in
1835, and made him—what be had never till then supposed he
should be—something of a politician, for hp felt that the liber-
ties of his countiyweie in dangei Aid he regiettednow to
find a gentleman who btoodm a position m which his services
might be so eminently effective setting his face against refoim
in those very abuse 
Mr WISE explained He professed to go for refoim now,
as he always had done In thatiebpett, he btood now where he
had always stood But the question was, whethpi it was a
point of reform—the mere question whether a. contingent item
should be put into one bill or another He did not set his face
against íeíbrm, on the contiaiy, he would go as far to effect
that object as hp who went farthest
Mr GENTRY resumed He did not intend to do injustice
to the gentleman If they weie both honestly engaged in the
pursuitof the same object and diffeied in opinion, he would
compare opin'ons with that gentleman

doubt the fact until the record should establish it Let the
gentleman bring forward his measure, and he (Mr G ) would
go with him—and if it laded, let the respenbibihty rest where
it should*
One declaration the gentleman had made of a most startling
character In his remaiksof yesteiday, as they appeared m
the ' Intelligencer," he was reported to have said.
' He accused Mr Fillmoke of having seized on the pretext
of the application of a part of the contingent fund to strike at
the Madisonian, and thus deprive tlv Executive of what had
always been enjoyed under every previous Administration—
the advantage of having a public press at the seat of Govern-
ment to speak in his behalf, while other pies&es expiessed the
views of the Oppcsmon II this course was to be sanctioned
by the majority, andpuisuedfor party ends, then the friends
ot the President must fall back on the true principes of re-
form, and, depriving tlv presses on both sides of all Govern-
ment patronage provide for doing the public printing at Go-
vernment expense "
Mr G.hwped that the gentleman had done injustice to the
chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means, in atuibuting
to him a motive so nariow, but there was in the lemarks
somethingoi g/eatei importance than any connected wiih the
motives of that gentleman.
The gentleman from Virgimasaid
"He accused Mr. Fillmore of having seized on the pretext
of the application of a part of the contingent fund to strike at
the Madisornan, and thus deprive the Lxecuuve of what had
always been enjoyed under every previous Administration—
the advantage ot having a public pi ess at the seat of Govern-
ment to speak in his behalf, while othei presses expressed the
views of the Opposition '
The gentleman spoke complaimngiy, as it seemed to him,
(Mr  G ) and then he added
"li this course was to be sanctioned by the majority, and
pursued for party ends, then the friends of the President must
fall back on the true principles of refoim "
He (Mr G ) hoped that the report did injustice to the gentle
man, and that he would disclaim the inierence fairly deducible
from his remaiks,that, provided things weie left as they now
weie, and the patronage of the Goveromen was peimiued to
be lavished on the "Madisoman," he i Mi Wise] was content,
but that if this was not done, if the proviso was not stricken
out, then he would fallback on the true principles of reform,
to wit the separation uf the patronage oí the Government
from the political press.
Mi WIfcE explained He had not seen the leport before it
was published, and he wag not responsible for it. It was gent
rally conect, but nothing had been said by him whith could
justify the stiong inference of the gentleman ruom Tennessee
He, Mr W put his motion on no contingency, he went Jul the
rtform for its own ¡sake
Mr GEN IKY íesumed If he had misapprehended the
import of the remarks, he was glad to be assured oí the fact
l hete was, however, one other point made by the gentleman
which had attracted his, Mi. G 3s attention at the time, and
which, probably moie than any thing else, inspired him with a
wish to address tha committee last evening It was that pait
in which the gentleman ifierredto a supposed intimation on
the part of the chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means,
m conjunction with the Whig party, to withhold supplies irom
this Government
In that connection the gentleman was reponed t« have said
"Tiue, the gentleman ¡rom 3New \oik hid \eiy iaiily and
openly pi o tested against such a couice, but theit had been at
the same moment a leei of his tye, a h m toward his paity
friends, in which it was imposible Mi W could have been
deceived The gentleman ploughed out way aud luoked an
other If that was tobe the policy, then he said to the gentle
man and his fuends, Go it1 go it, and I shall be thankful to
you* All he would say foi the Aumioistration was, that it
would attempt to do its duty, although siutou titled by obstacles
such as Administration nevei had to encounter before, it
would go on and lecomnund suitable measures and advocate
them on proper grounds, if it could not give the touutiy

The CHAIR, (with euiphabi  ) The gentleman j  not in
ordei
Mr GENTRY I was about to show that the party had
marched up to the responsibility, not only of voting through
the House a tax bill, (always a high and delicate duty,) in order
to supply the ways and means to an Administration which had
proved recreant to its party, as they thought, but that they had

also undertaken the additional responsibility «f votüíf&aLoan
bill, in order sail further to supply it with means.   That was
at the extra sessiob   At the present session, wjaathasthat party
done?
The CHAIR again interposed to order-
Mr. W w IRWIN and Mr. HOLMES expressed the hope
that Mr G would be allowed to proceed.
Mr GENTRY    I was merely referring to a few historical
fans, wwh a view------
The CHAIRMAN said the Chair decides that the gentleman
is out of order
Mr GENTRY appealed from the decision, on 4he ground
that he had a right to íeply to the remarks of the gentleman
fiom Virginia
And the question, "Shall the decision of the Chair stand as
the judgment of the Committee?" was taken and decided m the
affirmative—yeas 80, noes 66.
So the decision ol the Chair was affirmed.
The CHAIRMAN    The gemleman  from Tennessee will
please to proceed in order
Mr GENTRY, professing his warm advocacy of the rules of
order, and adverting to his habitual observance of them, said
that ht did not intend to say any thing outof order, or any thine
that was discourteous or indecorous He had merely desired
(he was understood to say, though in this part imperfectly
heard) tücontrasúhe course of the Whigs m this House with
the course of the peculiar friends of the present Administration,
as illustrated on the Tax hill, the Loan bill, the bill for the «•
lief of the Post Office Department, and, at the present session,
on the Ireasury note bill And he had intended to have In-
quired of his friend from Virginia [Mr Wise] what would have
been the condition of this Administration if it had relied on such
counsellors as himself [Mr. W ] This he had intended to say,
but was sorry that he had not been permitted to say it, [Roars
of laughter, and cries of "neatly done "] He protested against
the interposition of the Chairman, though he did not doubt thas
it was actuated by th" best of motives; and he protested against
the decision of the committee &h an infringement of the right of
debate
He was glad, however, that the gentleman from Virginia had
exprebsed a willingness, m the course of the debate, to strike
tht contingent itemsfiom this bill He (Mr G) hoped this
would be done by common acquiescence, without further strug*
gle, and thai the subject would be referred to the Committee
ol Ways and Means, with such instruction as the House might
choose to vote, or to a select committee He would not stickle
about that.
It was impossible, he knew, to avoid the necessity of contin-
gent appiopnations to some extent, but he believed there was
no necessity for any thinir like the amount appropriated by this
bill Since theyeai 1820 the amount had swelled to an extent
that wab positively astounding, and which nothing but extra va-
gante and coiruption could account for
In the year 1823 the contingent appropriations amounted
to $384,615 In the yeai 18^7, to $529,360 And m the
year 1842 the amount was «1,116,308, or moie than one-
seventh of the whole amount proposed to be appropriated by
this bill.
Thcie must be something wrong in this, and the necessity
for reform was obvious and paramount
Mi CUSHING addressed the Chairman, but yielded the
flooi for a moment to—
Mr. WISE, who said as the gentleman from Tennessee
[Mi Caruthers] had intimated his intention to move to
stnke out all the items for contingencies, he would withdraw
hisamendment if the gentleman would move to strike out this"
whuleitem
Mr CARTJTHERS said he would then move to etrike out
the whole clause
But before any change was made in the question—

Mr. EVERETT i equested the gentleman from Massachusetts
(Mr CtrsH(No)to allow him to give notice of a motion he in-
tended to make He should move, in the end, to strike out one-
half of the contingent appropriations, leaving oi,e haif, which
would be a sufficient guarantee to carry on the public service
until the othei bill is reported.
