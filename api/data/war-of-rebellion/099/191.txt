(Received 1. 20 p.m.)

Major-General SCHOFIELD, Washington:

There are about 5,000 troops here belonging to Terry's command, which will be forwarded as rapidly as possible. Mechanics have already gone to Beaufort. They can be transferred to Fort Fisher if you deem it advisable. A pile-driver will leave Anapolis on Thursday for Fort Fisher, with a sufficient force to work it. The pontoon train left here on Sunday.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE OHIO,Washington, D. C., January 31, 1865-1. 20 p.m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT, City Point, Va.:

I have received your dispatch of 10 a.m. to the Secretary of War. * General Rucker thinks it will be impossible to get out of the Potomac before Friday or Saturday, but will try to break the ice to-morrow. General Meaghers' detachment, about 5,500 strong, is ordered to Annapolis, where there will be transports enough for it. I propose to send all of General Meagher's troops to New Berne and take the Twenty-third Corps to Cape Fear River. Meagher will probably get down first, but will, I presume, not be strong enough for the move against Wilmington. Please inform me if you approve of this arrangement.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

Major General J. M. SCHOFIELD, Washington, D. C.:

The arrangement you have made to send Meagher's command to New Berne is satisfactory.
