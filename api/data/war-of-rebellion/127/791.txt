has been too brief to permit a thorough mastery of all the details of so vast and complicated an organization as that now presented by this Department. I can only refer to the principal occurrences requiring the special notice of the Congress, and suggest some difficulties and embarrassments of administration that can only be remedied by the legislative power.

First. Since the adjournment of Congress official reports have been received disclosing the gratifying fact that the population of Arizona is almost unanimously desirous of the annexation of that Territory to the Confederate States.

The U. S. troops there, routed, and put to flight by the expedition under the command of Lieut. Colonel John R. Baylor, had at one time abandoned the country. Under these circumstances Colonel Baylor, after satisfying himself of the wishes of the inhabitants, proceeded upon his own responsibility to assume the military government of the Territory of Arizona. He issued a proclamation extending the limits of the Territory to latitude 36 30' north; thence due west to the Colorado, and down that stream to its mouth. He also raised several companies of infantry, furnished by the people, who readily volunteered in our service; placed the inhabitants in this manner under military protection, and established a government closely resembling in form that which was found to work so satisfactorily when the United States made conquest of California.

All the proceedings of Lieutenant-Colonel Baylor appear to have been marked by prudence, energy, and sagacity, and to be deserving of high praise. The result of this action has been the securing to the Confederacy of a portion of the territory formerly common to all the States but now forming a natural appendage to our Confederate States, opening a pathway to the Pacific and guaranteeing Western Texas from the dangers incident to allowing the Indian tribes in that extensive territory to remain under foreign influence. The report herewith presented, marked A,* gives a satisfactory statement of the proceedings of Colonel Baylor. Since his success in expelling the Federal troops and taking peaceful possession of the Territory an effort has been made by the United States to disturb the tranquillity of the inhabitants by sending in a force of about 2,500 men, under Colonel Canby, who at the last advices was marching toward the headquarters of Colonel Baylor at Dona Ana. This movement had, however, been anticipated, and General Sibley, to whom that military department has been confided, had already sent forward two regiments to the support of Colonel Baylor, and was on the eve of following them himself with a third. There is no doubt that the entire force of General Sibley must already have arrived within supporting distance of Colonel Baylor's command, and full confidence was entertained by our leaders that they will be able to drive the invading forces out of our territory. The letters of General Sibley of November 8 and 16 are appended for the further information of Congress. #

In organizing a more permanent Territorial government for Arizona, with its present expanded boundaries, I beg to suggest that the population is of so mixed a character, and the number of inhabitants educated in representative institutions is so limited, that it would scarcely be practicable to maintain social order and insure the execution of the laws by an elective government.
