Report of Brigadier General James S. Negley, U. S. Army.
HEADQUARTERS UNITED STATES FORCES, Nashville, Tenn., November 5, 1862.

SIR; I have the honor to inclose you an official reports of small affair with the enemy to-day. I do not apprehend an attack upon Nashville in force before the arrival of the enforcements. The enemy continue to concentrate troops at Murfreesborough and toward Nashville. Their force positively exceeds 25,000, of which at least 5,000 are cavalry. They have about forty pieces of artillery, and it is now certain that a portion of Bragg's army is at Murfreesborough; but whether they will maintain a position at Murfreesborough or this side is not plainly indicated by their present operations. Their cavalry approach our lines daily, and are engaged in driving off stock and negroes. My command is in fine spirits and the transportation in excellent condition.

With assurances of high personal esteem, I am, yours, very truly,JAS. S. NEGLEY,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Lieutenant-Colonel DUCAT,

Chief of Staff.
