.that the facts, as set forth and construed in the
Cincinnati Gazette, eotlld be true. 'It seemed
to me impossible. I could not -.believe they
were 1 rue in the manner and to the extent
rep-
reseated. I felt moved to imake inquiry in
regard to the matter. The result of my investi-
gate m was, that in that case ,fche whole thing
consisted, in the franking of his own speech
printed iti a newspaper, and that therefore the
act was entirely within the law and legitimate.
Whatever criticism shall be made on the case
should be. made on the law itself, and not on
the use of it. For the rest, I say confidently
that no one who knows him believes the gen-
tleman from Maine capable of selling his frank.
Moreover it is undoubtedly true that there
are abuses of the franking privilege which are
not warranted or rather occasioned law.
They are uses of the franking wholly outside
of law, and have no legitimate warrant what-
ever. These abuses of the franking privilege,
as well as certain other uses of it which are
entirely legitimate, make it necessary, in my
view, that we should take into consideration
the duty of so restricting and reducing that
privilege, by modifying the law, as to prevent
these abuses and confine the matter of frank-
ing to what may absolutely be required by the
public service.
president's message.
Mr. JONES, of Kentucky. I ask unani-
mous consent to offer the following preamble
and resolutions :
Whereas resolutions have been introduced and
passed in both Houses of Congress severely condemn-
ing the late message of the President of the United
grates, especially upon the subject of the national
finances and his suggestions relative to the allevia-
tion ot'tue national emb irr.Hsmont; and whereas it
is the right aud duty of thoPresident to "Kive to the
Congress information of the stato of the liniou, and
recommend to their consideration such measures as
ho shall deem necessary and expedient:"
Be it therefore resolved/Vh&t such resolutions are an
infringement upon the rights of the Executive, and
calculated to obviate the faithful discharge of his con-
stitutional duty; and that however much the Congress
m ty differ with the President upon his recommend-
ation in regard to the discharge ot tho national debt,
it involves aquestion which should bematurely con-
sidered by every Ameiicau citizen, and win oh the
American people have the light to determine, as they
doubtless wiil in their own good time, governed by
the precedents and principles which have controlled
the enlightened nations of the world, and accormng
to the exigencies which surround them, find in a man-
ner, too. which wiil vindicate their own credit and
honor.
llexolved. That one hundred thousand copies of
the late annual message of the President be pub-
lished for the benefit of the people of the United
