General SCHIMMELFENNIG,

Commanding U. S. Forces, Morris and Folly Islands, &amp;c.:

GENERAL: I have the honor to inclose, for transmission to the commanding general of the U. S. forces on this coast, a letter from Major General Samuel Jones, commanding this department.

The letter informs him that 5 generals and 45 field officers of the Federal army, prisoners, have been ordered to be confined in Charleston. These officers have been placed under my charge, and will be provided with commodious quarters, in a part of the city occupied by non-combatants, the majority of whom are women and children.

It is proper that you should know, however, that the portion of the city in which they are located is, and has been for some time, exposed day and night to the fire of your guns.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. S. RIPLEY,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
