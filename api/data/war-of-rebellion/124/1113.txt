The Governor of Michigan was authorized on the 25th of July, 1863, to raise one regiment of infantry. For this regiment three full companies have been recruited.

In addition to the foregoing, authority to raise colored troops has been issued as follows, viz;

The Governor of Delaware one regiment of infantry, June 24, 1863; the Governor of Iowa, one regiment of infantry, July 27, 1863; the Governor of Wisconsin, one regiment of infantry, July 31, 1863; the Governor of Illinois, one regiment of infantry, September 25, 1863; Brigadier General Thomas Ewing, jr., one regiment of infantry in Eastern Kansas, August 8, 1863; Major General J. G. Foster, one regiment of infantry, September 30, 1863.

No material progress in raising the above regiments has yet been reported.

While the operations above recited have been in progress in the Northwestern, Western, Middle, and Eastern States, one additional regiment has been raised in each of the Carolinas, and sixteen regiments have been added to the four previously raised in Louisiana, while Brigadier General L. Thomas, Adjutant-General U. S. Army, has been vigorously at work in the Valley of the Mississippi from Iowa to the Gulf of Mexico. Of the operations of General Thomas it is not necessary or proper that I should speak his reports, being forwarded directly to the Secretary of War, under whose immediate instructions he is acting.
