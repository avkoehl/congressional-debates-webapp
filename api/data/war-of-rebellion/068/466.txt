Major-General HUMPHREYS,Chief of Staff:

My cavalry has been engaged, and is now engaged, heavily at Todd's Tavern and on the Brock road in front of the Furnances, 3 or 4 miles. It is reported that there is infantry in their front. There is no infantry on the Brock road. Wagon train has been reported moving from Parker's Store toward Shady Grove Church, or moving from Shady Grove Church toward Parker's Store. Which direction it is moving is not well known. Every attack made upon the cavalry so far has been handsomely repulsed.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,Chief of Staff:

The cavalry is all right. So far they have handled the enemy very handsomely in every attack that they have made. I think it best not to follow up any advantage gained, as the cavalry is now very far out from this place and I do not wish to give them any chance of getting at our trains.

HEADQUARTERS FIRST BRIGADE, FIRST CAVALRY DIVISION,

May 6, 1864-12 m.

Captain McCLELLAN:

I was attacked by Fitz. Lee's division near the intersection of the Furnace and Brock roads. After an obstinate fight I drove him in disorder from the field, compelling him to leave a considerable number of dead and wounded on the field. My loss will be about 20 in all. General Rosser's assistant adjutant-general was killed. I have prisoners from Young's and Rosser's brigades. Colonel Devin, with his command, arrived in the nick of time and rendered good service. Gregg also let me have two guns. The enemy retired rapidly to my left, and are now in front of Gregg.
