HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, June 18, 1864-1.30 p.m.

Major-General BUTLER:

Colonel Paine has reported to me your wishes for the return of General Hinks. This officer's command forms a part of that portion of the Eighteenth Corps which I retained here under the written authority of Lieutenant-General Grant to assist in the attacks I am now making. So soon as these active operations are over and I can spare General Hinks, I will send him and General Martindale to you and trust you will be able to send me back Wright and the two divisions of the Sixth Corps.

Respectfully, yours,GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General, Commanding Army of the Potomac.

HDQRS. DEPT. OF VIRGINIA AND NORTH CAROLINA, In the Field, June 18, 1864-11.30 p.m.

Major-General MEADE,

Commanding Army of the Potomac:

I have directed General Wright to send one of his division to you. Immediately upon their arrival will you relieve the troops of the Eighteenth Corps, and as they arrive I will forward the second division of General Wright.

BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Major-General.

SECOND CORPS, June 18, 1864-12.45 a.m.

General WILLIAMS:

In making arrangements for an assault I find that about all of my command is in line, and where it cannot be withdrawn. To assault at a given point I can probably get three, perhaps four, lines, with a brigade front. I cannot attack with the rest of my forces, except in case of decided success by this assaulting column, as in case of repulse I would have nothing to hold my line. I will assault with the force indicated, as I do not understand that you intend any part of my line abandoned or compromised, except the enemy show evident signs of weakness.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.

EIGHTEENTH CORPS, June 18, 1864.

General HANCKOCK:

A brigade of enemy's infantry has just passed to our left along ridge to our left of the town.

P. A. TAYLOR,

Captain and Signal Officer.

[Indorsement.]

Forwarded to General Warren for his information.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
