HAGERSTOWN, July 10, 1864-8 p. m.

Major-General COUCH:

Lieutenant Pearson, a staff officer from Harper's Ferry, just arrived with dispatch for General Halleck; the subject-matter corroborates what Graham telegraphed the Governor to-day. A reporter for the New York World, also just arrived from Frederick, says rebels left there this morning, and that Federal cavalry occupied the town. He also says enemy supposed to be crossing the Potomac at Noland's Ferry en route for Leesburg. Lieutenant Pearson also reports learning coming along that the enemy are retreating on the Little Georgetown road, and recrossing at Noland's. The World reported met with no enemy between here and Frederick. I have not yet heard from Hunter.

CHAMBERSBURG, July 10, 1864.

Major-General COUCH:

The enemy are 3,000 strong around Lewistown and Creagerstown, Md., under Bradley T. Johnson. Impossible to get near Frederick at this point. There is a force supposed to number 7,000 men at Smoketown. It is confirmed about the enemy fortifying South Mountain. Imboden, with about 1,500 men, came down the west side of the mountain; about eight of the enemy came into Smithtown, eight miles from Waynesborough, for plunder. I had to come here to get fresh horses; before leaving Waynesborough I started two good men toward Boonsborough.

GETTYSBURG, July 10, 1864.

Major-General COUCH:

Scout just in and reports rebel horse-thieves have been withdrawn inside their lines, and no pickets farther north of Frederick than three miles. Heavy fighting south of Monocacy Junction from 8 to 12 a. m., infantry and artillery; the sound was incessant and steady, and in same locality, indication that we held our position. Stragglers from the fight yesterday represent it as sharp and severe; that the enemy advanced with four lines against our single line west of the Junction. The division of the Sixth Corps fought with great bravery, and lost severely.

GETTYSBURG, July 10, 1864.

Major-General COUCH:

Squads of rebel cavalry are infesting the mountain from Monterey to Frederick, stealing horses, and creating much alarm. One or two cavalry companies, with organized bushwhackers, would check their operations and protect our people.
