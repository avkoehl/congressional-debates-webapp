Captain NANCE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Numbers 25. Reports of Brigadier General A. H. Colquitt, C. S. Army, commanding on Morris Island, July 26-28, and August 27-September 2.

MORRIS ISLAND, July 26, 1863.

GENERAL: By relieving Colonel Olmstead's command with the Sixth Georgia, the garrison will be reduced to about 1,000. It should be increased to 1,200. A detachment from Captain De Pass' company of artillery is ordered off, 24 men. Their place should be filled. Can you send a field officer of artillery to act as chief, as good man?

It will relieve us of embarrassment about rank.

Respectfully,

A. H. COLQUITT,

Brigadier-General.

General RIPLEY,

Commanding.

MORRIS ISLAND, July 27, 1863-12.45 a.m.
