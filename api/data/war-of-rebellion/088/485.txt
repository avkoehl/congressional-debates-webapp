draw to-night if you deem it best for the security of your command. If the destruction of the road cannot be continued there is no object in holding Reams', export to keep out the enemy, a secondary matter. I prefer having your corps within supporting distance of Warren and to assist in holding his flank and rear.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,August 25, 1864-10.30 p. m.

Major-General HANCOCK,

Commanding Second Corps:

At 7.30 p. m. an order was sent you by telegraph to withdraw and take position near the Williams house, looking toward Warren's left. The telegraph operator here report that it was received by your telegraph operator, but it is apparent now, since the arrived of your staff officer, Captain McEntee, that your telegraph office was then in the hands of the enemy, who probably got the dispatch. It also referred to Mott's brigade at the intersection of the Reams' Station road with the plank road. The commanding general directs you to withdraw if you can do so with security, and desires me to inform you that he has ordered Crawford's division and White's division, of the Ninth Corps, both under Crawford, to me once to your support. Crawford will take with him the two brigades of Mott on the plank road, about 2,000 strong. These re-enforcements the commanding general hopes will be sufficient to cover your withdrawal.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
