THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
December 13,
by the existing state of things The act having
accomplished its object, he was willing that it
should be repealed, and the soonei it was done
the battel
Mr CLAY, of Kentucky, concurred in some
things said on both sides, and differed in seveial
Wlntevti might have been the motives of othets,
lie voted toi it as an act of distubution He did
not share m the grief expressed foi its passage,
lie had no legiets about his vote on this measure
He thought with the Senatoi from South Caiohna,
[Mi Caliioi, !,] that it had been of much benefit
He voted for it witn the view and belief that the
money was a gift from the Government to the
States His only regret was that the fourth in-
stallment was not paid, that the States had not
the nine millions due them from the Govei nment
He said the tanfl was not the cause of the sui
plus, and the subsequent embanassmcnts of the
countty It was the lesultot fitil "exnetiments"
of the executive blanch ot the Government
There was anothei measure—the land bill—that
would have pic ven ted a suiplus This bill, which
had passed both branches of tin Legislature, but
"which Geneial Jackson letamcel in hi& possession
—and which he bad no doubt would have ie
reived the sanction of the constitutional majority
of Congress, had it been lotuinid—would li ivi
prevented a suiplus Theie would have been no
distubution of a suiplus, and no demoralization
of public moials Ilu distubution act was in-
ccssaiy and piopei, and should be called an act
to save fiom wasteful and eviiava^uit cpe ndi
ture the amount of money so d< posited Willi the
States Lie thought that tin installment dm to
the States could be pud, and pud in tin tnin
pioposed in his amendment Iti ould be p uel by

was thtie any one piestnt who believed that theie
would be money in the Tieasuiy to pay this in-
stallment by that time} Not only was there no
money to pay this installment now, but every
one believed that there would not be any by the
lstofTanuary, 1840 This was the due state of
the case, and on it he was content to rest, the
question
Mi RIVES was in favor of the amendment
He said an attempt had been made to show that
the proposition before the Senate was very dif-
ferent from the deposit act, he could not see the
diffeience He was not smpnsed at the course
the Senator from Missoun [Mr BEf,TON] and the
Sen ator fi om New Yoik [Mr Wricht] bad taken
on tin1! question, they had opposed it from the
fust, and were consistent on tins point, but, for
his own pait, whatever might be the course of
others who had supported the bill, he would nevei
do anything that would look like a condemnation
—an ex post facto condemnation—of that act of
high legislation Her thought that there nevei
had an act of more beneficial influence emanated
fiom congressional legislation He was not pre-
pared to say that the founh installment would
not be paid He thought theie was a gieater
piobabihty of its being paid than at the last ses-
sion, when a measure similar to the one proposed
was adopted by Congiess In voting for it he
did not consuli i that we weie pledged to pay the
installment at the time speeifii d in the amend-
m< tit, his idta was that rt should be paid when-
evi i the Govei nment was in funds lie thought
th it so Ion;  as this ule i of a payment of the
ftHiith installment of di posit—fin it was strictly
a deposit—was held up, the ( xi i utive would not

Mi DROWN did not use to discuss the ques

the di posit act of ¡Mil, should be postponed, as

doubtedly the administration of Mi  Adams, by
whose act, and by wnose sanction, this enoimous
amount of money was raised, which the Govei n-
I ment was compelled to get rid of m some way   Is
it now to be said   that the political part/ who

things, and whose efforts to run the Govern m nt
expendituiesup to their highest point, and whose
| progress tovvaids that favorite lesuk in their pol
I icy, was powerfully restrained bv the constitn-
) tional negative of the late Picsident, aie the eco-
nomical party?   This cannot be done until the
voice of truth is sjlenced, and the public docu
1 ments foigotten      At the session of Congiess in
| 1831, the Secretaiy of the Tieasuiy, in his annual
j íepoit on the finances, carrying out the principle
assumed by Piesident Jackson, that the levenue
I of the Govei nment should be biought down to i
I propel standard of expenditure, after piesenttng
I a vanety of views in suppoit of that piopositio i,
comes to the conclusion th it'• an annual revenue
of fifteen millions will be fully adequate "
Bytlns meas we,pioposed as an Admimsti-tion
measuie, and uewed as an Admim ti ition mens-
uie at the time, and tor wliicn it w is seve ciy
denounced by manv of the modem ecuiomists,
the admimsti ition of President Jackson attemp'ed
í ii annual reduction ot about fifteen million dol-
íais, as the revenue then acciumg undei the
m asaie sanctiored by Mi Adams amounted to
at letst thnty mil ion dollars annuall v, and out n
I aftcnvaids exceeded that amount Wl c e then

of tint paity «tood the Senatoi fiom Kentucky,
combatting for his favorite system If it cou'd
the n have been reduced, if the policy of the Ad-
mimsti ation had then prevailed, the counti y would
not only have been íelicved fiom an oppie^stvc
burden, but the means foi ex'ravagance wit'd
have been withheld, and the Government ex-
penditures, as a matter of comse, kept in then
title limits It is not, theiefore, for those to com-
plain who aie the tiue authors of the ei lis, which
were inevitable fiom then own course of act on
i The Senator from Sot th Carolina [Mi Pre 
tom] has also (said Mi E) favored us with a lee
tine on economy Mi B expressed his solemn
conviction that if the yeas and nays on the Jo n-
nals of the two branches of Congress were ex-
amined foi the last nine yeais, the political paity
with whom that gentleman is now asso íated, as
a body, would be found to he the pi tpctratois of
the offense which he now denounces He would
