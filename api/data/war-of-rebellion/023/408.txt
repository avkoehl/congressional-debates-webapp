Colonel FRY:

A respectable man just arrived from Carthage-left there at 5 p.m. yesterday-says Morgan was then at Hartsville and Forrest and Starnes at Dixon's Springs.

HEADQUARTERS,Decherd, August 24, 1862.

General McCOOK:

We must reach Altamont together by 12 o'clock day after to-morrow. There must be no failure or the result may be disastrous. As it turns out it was unfortunate that you did not move to the Therman road as ordered. Let us not fail again. Instead of going by Tracy City go by Pelham. The road is longer and not so good, but it puts you on a road to fall back on in case of failure. In such a case we will fall back on Murfreesborough by the way of Manchester and Beech Grove.

D. C. BUELL.

(Commanding officer at Battle Creek forward with all possible dispatch.)
HEADQUARTERS,Decherd, August 24, 1862.

General ROUSSEAU, Huntsville:

Order the force from Huntsville to march to this point via New Market and Salem, instead of moving by Fayetteville and Shelbyville.

HEADQUARTERS,Decherd, August 24, 1862.

General ROUSSEAU, Huntsville:

There are some rations at Athens; try and take them with you. If you can't, tell Major Murray, Kentucky cavalry, to take all the wagons at Athens and load them and bring them over with him. He should march rapidly.

JAMES B. FRY.
