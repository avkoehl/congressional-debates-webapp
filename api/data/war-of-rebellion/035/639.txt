[Indorsement.]

HOLSTON SPRINGS, SCOTT COUNTY, VIRGINIA, February 18, 1863.

The Sixty-fourth Virginia Regiment has been formed since Mr. Seddon

came into office, and is composed of men raised in Lee, Scott, and Wise Counties, Virginia. One battalion of the regiment has not been drilled a month. The Fifth Kentucky Regiment is composed of recruits raised in Kentucky last fall. Both of these regiments are going through with the mumps and measles, and, together, would not now parade for a fight more than 600 men. The troops were very sickly at Jonesville. Among other diseases, the small-pox broke out [it was said], and several officers and men have had it. While a great many of my recruits ran away from the pestilence, I left 125 men in hospital at Jonesville, and have about 40 under charge an employed physician here.

Of the enumerated 790 mounted riflemen, Jesse's squadron of 150 has not more than 30 men mounted, and is composed of new recruits [exchanged prisoners], and have not received much camp instruction.
