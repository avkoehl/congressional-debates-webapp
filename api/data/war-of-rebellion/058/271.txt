Major-General GRANT:

Your dispatch of 2 p. m. on the 29th is received. Your orders commanding active parties to be kept in the front are carried out as far as possible with the present exhausted state of the country, the weakened condition of the animals and men, and the state of the roads. I was about sending all the animals to Kentucky for forage, but will now keep them within call. Orders to insure as great preparation as we are capable of have been issued.

Major-General GRANT:

I have received a dispatch from General Rawlins directing me to prepare to take the offensive. I have given all the necessary orders. The veteran volunteers that have gone home from this army, with the re-enforcements received by Longstreet, makes his infantry force 5,000 stronger than mine. I shall have to depend on infantry principally, as very little artillery can be taken. I shall therefore require 10,000 additional infantry. A pontoon bridge is also necessary, of 1,200 feet in length. I have sent Colonel Babcock to Chattanooga to endeavor to get one. I also want a force sent from Chattanooga to work on the railroad through to the Hiwassee, and to bridge that stream. If you will give me this assistance I will do all I can to drive Longstreet out of the State, and will take the filed in an ambulance. You can rely on my efforts.

Do you think the enemy intends to advance on Knoxville? If so, you should not permit any more veteran regiments to go on furlough. I am doing all I can to get the railroad in order to supply you, and will be obliged if you will report fully your present situation and prospects.
