handed in many of the missing have returned, perhaps one-third of those reported. The inclosed report of Colonel Burnside, [No. 39], commanding Second Brigade, was sent to me after the above report was written. While respectfully calling the attention of the general commanding to it, I would also ask leave to notice some misconceptions under which the colonel commanding the Second Brigade seems to have labored at thee time of writing his report, viz; Of his agency in the management or formation of the Second Division on the field; 2nd, of the time that his brigade was entirely out of the action, with the exception of the New Hampshire Regiment; 3rd, of the position of his brigade in the retreat, and particularly of the position of the Seventy-first New York, as be may have mistaken the rear guard, organized under my direction by your orders, for the enemy.,

Captain Arnold's battery and the cavalry were directed and placed in their positions by my senior staff officer up to the time when Colonel Heintzelman ordered the cavalry to the front of the column.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. PORTER,

Colonel Sixteenth Infantry, U. S. Army, Commanding Brigadier and Div.

Captain J. B. FRY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
