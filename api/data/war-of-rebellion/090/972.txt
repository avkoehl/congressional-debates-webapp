HARPER'S FERRY, August 31, 1864.

(Received 9.40 p. m.)

Hon E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

I have information through rebel sources that Early, with his command, has been recalled to Richmond; that the main body of the enemy passed through Winchester several days ago. I think this to be the fact. I learn from the front that reconnaissances of cavalry as far as Berryville and beyond Smithfield, in direction of Bunker Hill, failed to find enemy to-day.

JNO. D. STEVENSON,

Brigadier-General.
