Report of Captain William E. Dawson, Saint Louis (Missouri) Battery.

In compliance with instructions from brigadier-general commanding I took there different positions on the day of engagement, but did not fire a shot, our infantry being in all cases before us. In the last position we were immediately behind the hottest of the fifth, but having given my sergeants instructions to let the cannoneers shelter themselves as much as possible, with their implements all ready for instant action, I have fortunately only the one casualty to report. The small number of men that we went in with rendered this precaution necessary, as the loss of even one or two of the men would have been very serious and have caused us to fire more slowly than we ought. This may be readily judged from the fact that we had four guns to man, there being, including sergeants and corporals, only 7 cannoneers and 6 drivers to the piece. The men all behaved well.
