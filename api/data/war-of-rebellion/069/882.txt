HDQRS. ARMIES OF THE CONFEDERATE STATES,September 14, 1864.

Respectfully returned to his Excellency the President.

I think the plan of giving officers according to number of guns, the gun being the unit in artillery, the best devised. But I do not think the proportion allowed judicious. Nor do I see any justice in restricting the artillery to the grade of brigadier. The artillery of an army of three corps like General Lee's is equivalent in importance to either corps of infantry.

HEADQUARTERS,September 19, 1864.

The number of guns should, in my opinion, be the basis of the number and grade of the officers of artillery, every battalion of at least four batteries each should have two field officers to insure care and attention off and on the field. An army of at least three corps should be entitled to a major-general as chief of artillery, and a brigadier as chief of artillery for each corps. The command of the artillery of each of the corps in this army is more difficult and responsible than a brigade of infantry.

Respectfully returned to his Excellency the President.

R. E. LEE,

General.
