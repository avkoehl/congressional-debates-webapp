from Hudson, Brookfield, and Sturgeon. I shall march upon Glasgow when Platte River Bridge is repaired; small squads from Green's command at Florida."

J. C. FREMONT,

Major-General, Commanding.

JEFFERSON CITY, September 12, 1861.

Major-General FREMONT:

When General Pope arrives at Glasgow how will he cross the river, the boats having been withdrawn recently? Shall I send one? Do you not mean Lexington instead of Glasgow that you intend to march upon? Telegraph confused.

JEFF. C. DAVIS,

Colonel, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS WESTERN DEPARTMENT,Saint Louis, September 13, 1861.

Colonel JEFFERSON C. DAVIS, Jefferson City:

In my dispatch to you I was quoting General Pope's words; refer to it. Pope did not say when Platte Bridge would be finished. I send you to-day two regiments, to remain at Jefferson City. In the mean time send forward immediately two regiments to the relief of Lexington, provided nothing has occurred since your last dispatch to render it inexpedient. Perhaps they may aid General Pope at Glasgow. Nothing heard from General Sturgis for several days. Move promptly. Inform me minutely.

J. C. FREMONT,

Major-General, Commanding.

JEFFERSON CITY, September 13, 1861.

General FREMONT:

Received a courier from Lexington to-day. Union troops burning the bridges ahead of Price. His force still estimated 10,000 to 15,000 Shall send a regiment on the War Eagle, with some cannon, to Arrow Rock and Glasgow. Hope to prevent Green's crossing.

JEFF. C. DAVIS,

Colonel, Commanding.

JEFFERSON CITY, September 13, 1861.

Major-General FREMONT:

Green has crossed at Arrow rock and is marching on to Booneville. The Iowa Fifth leaves early to-morrow morning on War Eagle to that place. The Indiana regiments I shall send to Syracuse, and make a forced march to-morrow night, so as to get in Green's rear with a view to capture him. Send me the troops, and I will take care of this place and Booneville. Let General Sturgis operate higher up the river and support Lexington. Let Sturgis send a courier to me when he leaves the Hannibal and Saint Joseph road, informing me where he will strike the river.

JEFF. C. DAVIS,

Colonel, Commanding.
