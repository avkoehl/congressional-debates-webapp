NATCHITOCHES, LA., April 6, 1864 - 10.10 a. m.

(Received 11 a. m., 6th.)

Brigadier General C. P. STONE, Chief of Staff, Dept. of the Gulf:

GENERAL: I have received your note of this morning concerning wagons for General Smith's ammunition. I have in my ammunition train 200 rounds per man of my command, of calibers .577 and .58. I understand that General Smiths' calibers are the same. The trains are all on the road now, and I presume that, as all are loaded with ammunition and provisions and the ammunition of the very kind that is required, this may make some change in the order of the commanding general. Should, however, it be still considered advisable the wagons will be unloaded at once and sent back.

Very respectfully, yours,

W. B. FRANKLIN,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE GULF,Grand Ecore, April 6, 1864.

Major General W. B. FRANKLIN, Natchitoches:

GENERAL: It will not be well to unload wagons to send back to General Smith, but you will have to be prepared to divide ammunition with General Smith, who will have about 7,000 men, of infantry.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

CHAS. P. STONE,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff.
