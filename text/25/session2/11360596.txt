Mr Chairman, in aU these measures the first mstm<*ta of the
people and of their lepiesentatives weiettue to the suggestions

mnchieious nopulaiity oí tne Executive The Bank was re-
ch/uteredby Congress—the lemoval of the deportes was for
bidden by C insre^—the land bill was pissed by Congress, and
the Treasury Cneiuar rejected by it Yet in each of these four
caulinil measmes—the foumamsofall the ills the country has
1 <tely suffered—the Executive wd! has outweighed and de
sf i < d the legislative judgment, and by 'hat will alone, defying
a ! o hei authority in this land, have tliebO measures been en

vc-nt the adjustment of the mercantile balance Appieheasions
weie even expressed th* re that the Bank of England aught be
d iven, by tre*>c demand upon the national coin, to another
s t sponsion of cash payments It was a measure on the part of
that bank and ol the English nation, not only of retaliation, but
of ibsoluteself piotec ion, to bring values to the standaul of die
act mista e of her currency, that currency reduced to its j ropei

to the cou ury dcalei foi fuuds,, the rise oí exchange co peded

The G Vi mmenthpd for «ome time been crying out against
the ban 1 s is the sources oí these appioachinff evds, and the
pe  ple, especially the mote uninformed part of them, looking
t nly at the confusion whn h tht,y paw in the currency, joined m
the cry i¿atn--t the b inks, and commenced that run upon ihem
whicn ¡n the e id rcjulttd—as eveiy body, except the Execn
uvb, had fueteen this, whole movement must have resulted—in
the -suspension of spec a payments
That suspension, I think I have shown, Mr Chairman, on
gmated m the pemiciousmeisures of die Administration It
v.as biimsht about by the unskilful and unwise policy of im-
1  ortmg the p ecious metals at a time when the interests and
d inaud-> oí trade *et m an opposite dnecti >n It meve imsne
( t fcl^ came from the extravag mt spcculauons of a class of
prisons not connected with the ipgulai operations of trade and
Lommerct In such a convulsion, the prudent and the wi^e
^ufflr their alíate of affliction as we!! as the thriftless and the
unwaty Wealth, industry, and circumspection are no feaie
guards against biich a calamity, when the calamity has otee
íoun i footing m the nation I do not believe, sir, that, m the
a dmary channels of regular commerce, theie has been any
ove\ trading or over banking, I have seen ho evidence to in
duce t>uch acondu ion On the contrary, our merchaats and
om mercantile banks have conducted themselves through the
di Mfuities of this alarming crisis v.uh prudence, moderaron,
and wisdom, worthy of all praise The attempt of the piesent
Executive to throw the blame ol these disasters «port the mer-
chants is an act of sueh gross injustice and wickedness aa to m
title it to the scorn of all nonorable men It is a base effort t 
screen ihe authors of our calamities from that indignant cest*
sure which their misdeeds have long deserved The admirable
Patlehce, fortitude, and fidelity, with which the merchants of
wte voiied, $w$$ addressed, t^eifl^ivee, m *ege iai§ trials t© j
the ,ask of sustaining the national cietlitaná good faith, have
not only wo > for them the nppl«use of their countrymen, but
hue drawn foith the spenurieousanil chterfuitribute of [>aii<j
gyuc 'iom all nation  with whom they hold intercourse It
í as been uttered in die Btitish 3&uUamertt ftom the lips of *m
paitiaí statesíiien, m language- -which hag found a response
ihrouahout that kingdom, audit will not be lor gotten here, s^i,
as long as America shall take pride m the m'egrtty and honoia-
ble bearing of that intelligent and pattioj-io class oí her citizens
The charge was made in a spirit which does no honor to its au-
thoi, and will be ever regarded as the subterfuge of a baffled
^ politician, seeking to find a stapt-ttoat lor his own oilenc* %
and selecting that body for Jus pm pose whrise numbers
may be .supposed to render them the least available of
all otheis m the State, m the electioneenng contests for
powei The truth is, sir, that the la'e Administiatu n and
its succe-soi have waged a wai against the bank's and
the meichant* , whuh hus le-ulted not only m then ovr 
overthiow, but in deep and laumg mjurv to the gre te^t
interests in the nation, without produciog a modicum of
good, unless u hem the ies*on it has taught us to avoiil such
follies in time to come U has of late become the fashion to deny
theae hostile sentiments ot the Administration against the hank?
I am glad to see it, sir, it is an mdualion of an appn aching
change of policy, it is a sign of contrition foi past ofemes
It is nevertheless true th it such a wai has been wased, and that
a bitter hostility has been evinced by the Executive gainst
these institutions, and even now, sn, is secretly felt, although
rof openly avowed Gentlemen on this floor have asked for
the pioof of this hostility To say nothing of thatTiojan war
between the Bank and the la'e Admimsti ation, with al! its anil
leiyof denu iciation, thty may find the pi oofs m the common

had some inkling's of it even n that abortive faice of a revolu-

evidences of it hei eon this floor, on a vety recent occa>ion, in
the almost Ireimcd gesticulation w ith which a gentleman con

Mr Chmnnon I have presented to the commit'ee what I con
reive to be the lea litis: even s in that tram of Government poli
cy to which the nation is indebted foi ail it has suffered I will
begto^iya evv words u¡ on the natuie of the remedy wiich
in i ly judgment, this reuosj ect suggests as the only one appro

In the first place I w.sb to see a solid and permanent resump-

tard the resumption, but rende rus continuante e>en a ma ter

cuti^my m the cotin'iy Sir, I am persuaded that the gieater
part or the peopleof theXIruted States now entei am this c r
viction, and that day bv day, as we giow oldei in expen&ice,
that conviction will be ex'ended Nothing can be more ri tifi

against sin h an mstnuuon That sentiment was fabricated hei c-
a' Washington, and circulated under the auepicesand fe\ tie
foice of ratty chelation, without even thesemblance of cor ul
