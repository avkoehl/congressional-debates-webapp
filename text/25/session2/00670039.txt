merely decided that we would not then again dis-
cuss and decide that question. This motion decided
nothing whatever but that we would defer the deci-
sion of the question to a more convenient season,
and would not suffer it to interfere with the trans-
action of the current daily business of the Senate
The motion to lay upon the table decide:  nothing
hut that the subject shall he upon the table lor that
day, subject to be again called up for consideration
at any future day. The motion prevailed by a
majority of 31 to 15, and this has been the course
ever since pursued by the Senate.
Upon reflection, (Mr. B said,) he never had
been better satisfied with the course which he had
pursued on any question than that now before the
Senate. He should now purposely avoid saying
any thing more upon the subject Let us enter at
tats moment upon a discussion of this question,
and the debate will continue for weeks, and will
light up a flame over the whole country. s We
have already solemnly discussed and decided the
question. Let us now adhere to that decision
firmly. He should not have men to say a void,
had it not been asserted that to vote to lay the
motion of recep'ion upon the table was inconsis-
tent with the right of petition, a right which he had
always asserted and should ever maintain

this paper le printed and Did on the table
Mr NORVELL of Alabama called 'or the read-
ing of the document
The Secretary havmsr read tie document,
Mr. KING ros= and said he c< nsidered it an
infamous libel and insult on the South, let it come
ironi what quau^r it vum'd , it was a false state-
ment in relation to the people of the South, when
it charged them with disiegird for the laws, and he
expressedhis stirpiise thatgenllemen should piesent
such papéis which they could not but feel were
untrue If it be so deep a disgrace to receive
into th s Union a Sta'e tolerating slavery, how
was it we have been, and still continue, together'
Coming Irom a State, if it had been couched in
proper terms, he would not have objected to lay it
on the table, but the language and import weie of
such a nature that he shouk be compelled to vote
against its reception He would not have voted
Mr SWIFT hoped he should never prove so
recreant to the interest of his constituents, as to re-
fuse the perl lniintf of his i'i'j, esptci' 'j to pre-
sent lesolutions coming from tne Legislature of
his State The document was the result of no
party effort, it was the united voice of the whole
State of Vermont, and he hoped to receive no
censure for rendering due obedience to instructions
emanating from so high authority
Mr CALHOUN deemed the present moment
one of the deepest importance A great step had
been taken in the progress of events The circum-
stance of the morning hal come upon him wholly
unexpected He h-*l never heaid that the re-
solutions in question hid been passed by the
Veunout Legislature, 3et he might have an ícipa-
ted as much He had long lore seen the present
stale of things, and now the time had actually
come, vi hen it « as to be detei mined w hether w e are
lo'igei to icmain as one united and happv people,
or v hether this Missed Un'on ins to be dissolved
b} the hand of violence Vermont has struek a
deep and dangerous, blow into the v mis ot our
confederacy It v\ is a time for action, and he
could not, would not, entertain the idea of rejecting
or losing sight of ihe do^ui lent befire ihe Senate,
but as he was unpiepared at present to act on the
subject, he would move that the memorial be
laid upon the table, pledging himself not
to oppose the S nator from Vermont, should he see
fit to call it up hereafter, and more, v ould call it
up h mself when he had time to prepaie h s mind
foi action on the sub|ect determined the subject
should not rest until 11 had received thermal action of
the Senate It was his belie! that Ihe North
vvev s mud in the matter at is~ue, but sime
seemed even to preler the prevalence of this dan-
get ous doctrine to th  preservation and continu-
ance of the Union His mind was unal.erably
fixed and nothingshould prevent him from putting
h's views into execution
Mr MORRIS tnought some respect was due to
the source whence th'se resolutions had emanated
— the Legislatura of Vermont—and hope i they
would at least be hid on th  table, and be pi n'ed
Mr CALHOUN had no ob|ection to the print-
ing, nor would he, if laid on the table, suffer it to
remain there a Ions time
Mr CUTHBERT called for t'e reading of the
fifth resolution   granted.
Mr. ALLEN said- Í wish, with the consent of
the Senate, to make an observation or two, expla-
natory of the position which I occupy upon the sub-
jea of this and all kindred petitions and me-
morials In order to do this, it is necessary to state
my views as to the effect of the pending motie n,
which is the same as that made yesterday, on the
piesentanon of the petition toabolish slavery m this
District
This motion has, in my judgment, the effect of
refusing to receive the petition, and it is for this rea-
son only that I will now, as I did 111 a like cas< 
yesterday, vote against it. But it is said that such is
not the effect I will state the proposition m a form
which will itself test this question One Senator
presents a petition, anotner Senator makes
a motion that the petition be not received;
a third Senator moves to lay that motion upon the
table This latter motion, if successful, puts an
end to the business Now, I ask, where is the pe-
tition' Is it m the Senate? Certainly not be-
cause the very form of the motion that the petition
be not íeceived, is a declaration that it has not been
received, and the veiy object ef that motion is to
pievent it from being received If the petition had
alieady been received, then the motion not to receive
would be absurd, and the other motion to lay that
motion on the table would effect nothing, because
the sole object of this latter motion is to exclude
the petition. If this be not its object, what is it' That
such are the object ana effect of this latter motion is
evident from the fact, that if it be agreed to, the
petition 1  then not m the Senate, and this is equally
evident from the fact that the Senate cannot pro-
ceed to take any further order on the petition. It
is, therefore, clear that the effect of the motion now
before us is to refuse to receive the petition, and,
as 1 am not prepared to deny the right of
petition, I shall, ioi that reason, vote against
the motion But I do not understand the
right of petition to involve eonsenuences so
extensive as those ascribed to it, veserday, by
the Senator from Kentucky, (Mr. Clay ) The
right of the citizen to petition, carries with it an
obligation on the Senate to hear—to receive his
petition, and leaves the Senate no discretion on
the question of reception, if the subject matter of
the petition be within the constitutional rights of
the citizen, and within the constitutional com-
petency of Congress. But when the peti-
tion has been received, then it becomes a
matter of discretion with the Senate, as to
what disposition shall be made of it- whether
it shall be laid upon the table, referred, or other-
wise disposed of Either of these acts is an act of
, deliberation, ot judgment, of discretion. They
are acts of a deliberative body, responsible not to
the individual petitioner, but to the nation and to the
States for these and all other acts. The right
of the citizen to petition m the cases I have sup-
posed, is coercive upon the Senate so far as re-
ception is m question, and then the right of the
whole people, and the States acting thiough the
Senate, commences, and the Senate, as their repre
sentative, must,, in the exercise of this right, exert
its own discretion ever the subject of the pe-
tition, but it this coercive right of the citi-
zfn continue after ihe petition is received, and
extend to the mode m which it shall be treated,
and the disposition which shall be made of It by
the Senate, then it would lose the character of a
petition, and assume that of an order If
this be admitted, the Senate would no longer
enjoy the laculty of deliberation, and one
man coming forward, in the character of
4 pet tioner, might compel the grant of
the object he desired, and would contiol the entire
legislation ot CongresN Such would be the ten-
dency of the principle, that the right of the peti-
tioner extended to the manner m wl fe'i his petitioa
should be disposed ot.
I, therefore, shall vote against this motion, as
I did that on yesterday, because I acknowledge the
right ot petition, and the correlative obligation on
the Senate to receive it And then, sir, as I do not
acquiesce in the prayer of the petitioner, nor admit
his right to control the action ot the Senate on h s
petition after it has been íeceived, I will vote for a
motion to lay the petition on th* table Upon ihn
ground I stand.
