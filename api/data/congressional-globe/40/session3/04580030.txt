Overland Mail.
The contracts with Holladay and Dinsmore
for the transportation of the overland mail for
the Territories and the Pacific coast expired on
the 30th of September last. To provide for the
service thereafter, the Department, by public
advertisement dated March 9, 1868, invited
proposals, to be received until the 10th of June
following, and decided by the 15th of the same
month, for conveying the mail from October 1,
1868, to June 30, 1870, dividing the service
into three routes, as follows, namely:
1. No. 16635. From Cheyenne, Dakota, or
that point on the Union Pacific railroad to
which the mails might be conveyed when this
service should go into operation, to Virginia
City, Nevada, 1,095 miles, and back, daily;
the trip to be performed in nine days each way
in summer, and twelve days in winter ; the ser-
vice and pay to be curtailed pro rata as each
fifty miles of the Union Pacific railroad should
be completed westward; and the Department
reserving the right to curtail the service at its
western terminus, when the eastward progress
of the Central Pacific railroad should be suffi-
cient to warrant the starting of the western
mails from a point on the railroad rather than
from Virginia City.
2. No. 14167. Prom Coyote, Kansas, the
end of the Union Pacific railroad, eastern di-
vision, to Denver, Colorado, 265 miles, and
back, daily ; the trip to be performed in seventy-
two hours each way ; and the service and pay
to be curtailed pro rata as the railroad should
be extended westward.
3. No. 17035. From Cheyenne, Dakota,
to Denver, Colorado, 102 miles, and back,
daily; the trip to be performed in twenty-four
hours each way.
For route No. 1G635, the following propo-
sals were received under the advertisement,
namely: Louis McLane, president Wells, Fargo
& Co., $1,314,000 per annum ; John Allman
and John H. Clark, $400,000; Charles A.
Cook, .$390,000; Charles .McLaughlin, $350,-
000; Carlton Spaids, $335,000.
For route No. 14167, Louis McLane, presi
dent Wells, Fargo & Co., $84,000; Charles
A. Cook, $79,000; Carlton Spaids, $49,000;
Henry S. Wheeler, $45,000 ; W. B. Hawkes,
$24,600.
For route No. 17035, Charles A. Cook,
$20,000; Louis McLane, president Wells,
Fargo & Co., $17,800; Carlton Spaids, $15,-
000; Henry S. Wheeler, $12,000; L. H.
Johnston, $9,970 50.
The Department accordingly, on the 15th
June, accepted the bid of Carlton Spaids, at
$335,000, on route 16635; that of W. B.
Hawkes, at $24,600, on route 14167 ; and that
of L. H. Johnston, at $9,970 50, on route
17035; and the accepted bidders were duly
notified.
On the 23d of September following, upon
representations that it was impracticable to
stock the road from the terminus of the Union
Pacific railroad, eastern division, to Denver,
(route 14167.) in consequence of raids by hos-
tile Indians, and that the service was unim-
portant, the mails for Denver being transmis-
sible with almost equal speed via Omaha and
Cheyenne, and upon the recommendation and
advice of the United States Senators and Rep-
resentative from Kansas the Department issued
an order to rescind the acceptance of the bid
of W. B. Hawkes and dispense with service on
the route.
During the montli of September, Carlton
Spaids, the accepted bidder on route 16635,
wrote the Department that, Congress having
passed a law since the contract was awarded
to him the effect of which would be to throw
upon this route the documentary and newspa-
per maiis formerly transmitted by the isthmus
route, he should expect additional pay pro
rata for every pound of such matter, and that
he desired to be informed, as near as possible,
what amount of such matter there would be,
and for what additional amount of pay the De-
partment would be responsible. The Depart-
ment replied by furnishing him with transcripts
of reports on its files showing the weights of
the mails transmitted both by the overland and
the isthmus routes, which contained all the
information it possessed on the subject, and
remarking that it would expect him to carry
the mail strictly according to the terms of the
contract, "using therefor such means" (quot-
ing the language of the contract) "as may be
necessary to transport the whole of said mail,
whatever may be its size or weight." Where-
upon, on the 29th September, Spaids gave
notice that he had come to the conclusion to
decline to transport any mail over the route;
and on the 2d October the Department received
telegrams, dated the 1st, from its special agent
and from the postmaster at Salt Lake City, re-
porting the failure of Spaids to put the service
in operation. A dispatch was immediately trans-
mitted to the next lowest bidder, Charles Mc-
Laughlin, at San Francisco, inquiring whether
he would carry the mail at his bid, ($350,000,)
and how soon he could commence the ser-
vice. His reply, received on the 7th, showed
that he would require thirty days to prepare for
theserviee. Ottthe 9th, Wells,Fargo & Co..
who, as sub-contractors under Holladay and
Dinsmore, had carried the mails on their routes
for some time prior to the expiration of their
contract term, and had continued the service
upon the failure of Spaids, gave notice to the
Department that they could not continue this
temporary service longer than the 10th. An
inquiry was thereupon telegraphed to the De-
partment's special agent at Salt Lake City,
whether arrangements could bo made to carry
the letter mail between the termini of the Union
and Central Pacific railroads, and at what. cost.
He replied on the 10th that he could find no
one prepared to carry the mails as designated
except Wells, Fargo & Co. A dispatch was
then sent to Brigham Young, at Salt Lake City,
inviting a proposal for the service. He replied
on the 11th, offering to carry fifteen hundred
pounds per day for eight months at $559,375,
with an allowance of 10 cents per pound per
100 miles for all additional mail, remarking that
grain was now three prices, consequent on the
destruction of crops by grasshoppers, and that
to put service on the route for the short period
of eight months would require proportionately
a much higher rate of payment than would
be required were the contract to extend for
several years. On the same date an offer was
submitted on behalf of the Union Pacific rail-
road to contract for the service for one year at
$1,500,000. Telegrams of the 12th, received
on the 18th, notified the department of the stop-
page of the temporary service and the accumu-
lation of mails on the route. On the 16th Charles
McLaughlin inquired by telegraph whether the
contract would be given to him at his bid. The
Department replied that it would on condition
that he would commence the service immedi-
ately. To this he made no answer. And on
the 21st the Postmaster General, having, with
the Second Assistant Postmaster General, re-
paired to the city of New York, and consulted
with Senator Morgan, Senator Cole, of Cali-
fornia, Horace Greeley, Isaac Sherman, Post-
master Kelly, and other leading citizens of
New York, under tHeir advice accepted a prop-
osition from Wells, Fargo & Co. to carry-the
mails between the termini of the Union Pacific
and Central Pacific railroads daily for the term
of one year, or until the two railroads meet, at
the rate of $1,750,000 per annum, subject to
deduction p>o rata for every section of fifty
miles of railroad completed and reported to
the Department ready to carry the mails, it
being estimated that the gap between the rail-
[ roads covered by the stage service will be
lessened at the rate of fifty miles every fifteen
days, or a hundred miles a month, and that it
will be closed up entirely by the 1 ?t of August,
I860, and that upon this basis the pay to Wells,
Fargo & Co., under their accepted proposal,
will amount in all to about $670,000.
Early in October a Senator from Kansas,
the principal public officers of Colorado, and
o'ther prominent citizens of the State and Ter-
ritory, began to urge the restoration of service
on the route (No. 14167) from the terminus
of the Union Pacific railroad, eastern division,
to Denver, representing it to be indispensable;
and finally Major General Sheridan, in com-
mand of the department of the Missouri, with
the concurrence of the Secretary of War, gave
assurance that the route was guarded, and
would be during the Indian troubles, and that
the service was important both to the citizens
and soldiers in Colorado. The accepted bid-
der being released by the order rescinding the
acceptance of his bid, the contract was offered
to the next lowest bidder. Henry S. Wheeler,
who declined; and a temporary arrangement
] was made on the 31st. October, with Wells,
j Fargo & Co., to carry the mails till 1st July,
1869, at the rate of $79,000 per annum, sub-
ject to deduction pro rata for every fifty miles
of railroad completed and reported to the
Department ready to carry the mail—the rate
being that of the bid next above Wheeler's,
excepting that of Spaids, the failing contractor
on route 16635.
On the remaining route the accepted bidder,
L. H. Johnston, having failed, the Department
accepted an offer from Wells, Fargo & Co. to
perform the service for one year, from 1st Octo-
ber, 1868, at the rate of Johnston's bid,namely :
$9,970 50 per annum.
Under the arrangements thus made, the over-
land mail service on the three routes is now in
regular operation.
TERRITORIAL MAILS.
In the last annual report allusion was made
to the route from Fort Abercrombie, Dakota,
to Helena, Montana, (or the route from St.
Cloud to Pembina,) intended to provide direct
mail communication to the Territories of Mon-
