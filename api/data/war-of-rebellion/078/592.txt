HDQRS. DEPARTMENT OF ALA., MISS., AND EAST LA.,Demopolis, May 10, 1864.

Brigadier General J. R. CHALMERS,

Commanding DIVISION:

GENERAL: I am directed by the major-general commanding department to say that the War Department wishes battalion organizations to [be] avoided as far as possible. In accordance with that policy, you will take such unattached companies as may be within your reach and add them to such battalions as you may have, in order to form regiments of them. Wherever this is done you will recommend the appointment of officers, taking care to forward at the same time full and complete muster-rolls of all the companies, in order to secure prompt action upon the nomination.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

POWHATAN ELLIS, JR.,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
