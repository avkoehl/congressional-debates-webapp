One of Forrest's regiments (Wisdom's) is stationed at William's Landing, 5 miles above Savannah, where they been some time.

I met the Robb on my return with the convoy yesterday at 11 a. m., about 50 miles below Clifton. There was 4 feet on the shoals when I left Waterloo, and river rising fast. If the Robb can get to Florence General Veatch can be communicated with. I sent the Robb to try and get there.

General BRAYMAN:

Veatch had no business to come away from Purdy, and now it is too late to correct him. Notify Hurlbut that Veatch left Prudy without orders. Hold the communication for him till you have a safe person to send it to me at Nashville.

Honorable E. M. STANTON, Secretary of War:

I do hope that General Buell will not be sent to Tennessee; anybody before him. He is not the man to send into Kentucky or Tennessee at this time. His influence will be with George D. Prentice and that class of men.

ANDREW JOHNSON,

Military Governor.
