CAPTAIN: The enemy have not retired from their position in front of Davis' house, but occupy the same ground as before their advance yesterday evening. My pickets are re-established at the posts held by them before being driven in. I have had no report this morning from my scouts on the left (or enemy's right). So far as my pickets can discover, no change has occurred in enemy's line to the left or west of Davis' house.

I am, captain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
