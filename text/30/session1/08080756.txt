THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
May 11,
of some of the officers of the treasury, have, m that
paperand others, made general denials of any seri-
ous mistakes, and charged me with disingenuous-
ness and unfairness m my charges against the Sec-
retary, but attempted no explanation of the errors
pointed out.
At last, sir, after so long a.time, and after much
labor at the department in furnishing materials,
the chairman of the Committee on Finance in the
Senate has undertaken a labored exposition of the
affairs of the treasury, in a speech delivered on the
22d March, and first published about two weeks
thereafter. As there has been no explanation fur-
nished by any member of this House, and as this
was clearly designed as substantially not only an
authorized but an official vindication of the Sec-
retary of the Treasury, I propose to examine its
main positions.
The design of the speech was plainly to explain
the whole subject of the loans and treasury notes
issued under the acts qf 22d July, 1846, and- 26th
January, 1847, and to show that the Secretary had
not committed the errors charged.
I shall endeavor to show that the figures of the
honorable chairman—of the Register of the Treas-
ury in his statement, on which those of the chair-
man are based—and in the general statement of the
Secretary of the Treasury, in the beginning of his
report on the finances, in relation to the treasury
notes and loans under these two acts, are grossly
erroneous; not in one or two instances, but in almost
every instance—not that there are errors in their
statements, but that in scarcely an instance are they
correct. Nor are they errors running through an
entire statement, arising out of one or two errors
which might thus affect the subsequent result, but
the mistakes are various and independent; they"are
not of small .sums, but of very large amounts.
On a former occasion I pointed out a number of
very gross mistakes in the report of the Secretary
of the Treasury, and endeavored to show, from
that document and the accompanying tables, the
nature and extent of these errors. It is now ac-
knowledged that one of these mistakes, of a very
large amount, was committed. JN'o attempt is
made to explain or correct my statements in iela-
tion to the others. It is now officially or semi-
officially admitted that the Secretary committed a
blunder in his annual official report to Congress of
at least $1,401,900. When this was first pointed
out by me, it was denied that there was any such
mistake.
I am aware that the honorable Senator has la-
bored very much to show that the error is not m an
over-statement of his means, but m an understate-
ment of expenditures. It is not very material which,
so long as the error is acknowledged to be a seu-
ous one in the statement of the actual receipts
and expenditures of the Government, requiring a
larger loan than called for by about a million and
a half of dollars. I may well leave the Senator to
settle the matter with the officers at the treasury.
1 do not, however, agree with him; and, unless all
the printed J^bies in the Secretary's report bearing
on this point are wrong, the Senator is himself
■wrong. 1 need not add, I think, to what I said on
a former occasion to show this. If hereafter it
should be deemed important to show when and in
what way this error arose, 1 will go more fully
into it. As it now stands, from all the official
statements accompanied by this authorized expla-
nation, it is, I think, apparent that the Secretary
did not possess the means which he publicly stated
the department to possess: that he had not the
treasury notes on hand that he said he had by
about a million and a half of dollars. At the time
when these charges were made, an advertisement
had been issued for proposals for $5,000,000 of
treasury notes, which were said to be in the hamls
of the Secretary of the Treasury, which he was
authorized under the law to reissue. When the
bids had been received for the stock, the amount
which he could deliver was found to be about a
million and a half less than he had advertised.
Various apologies were given in the papers and
elsewhere for this deficiency. The Secretary had
forgotten that he had sold to some State or indi-
vidual a million of dollars of the notes, and to some
one else half a million, &c. The true reason
doubtless, and the one which should have been
honestly avowed, was, that the Secretary had pro-
posed to sell more notes by at ieast $1,401,900 than
he could by law sell; and having at last discov-
ered the error, he withdrew the notes from market.
It is very obvious, if this gross mistake had not
been pointed out, and he had followed out his own
calculations, as contained in his report, that there
would have been an illegal and excessive issue of
treasury notes to the acknowledged extent of at
least p,401,900.
In the speech of the chairman of Finance of the
Senate, to which I have referred, he says:
"Ifthe honorable Senator will have patience, I beheve
that, before I get through, 1 shall be able to show that there
can be no mistake in the financial statements of the Secre-
tary, with the exception of one, which I will hereafter
explain, and which was discovered* in the Committee on
Fmance."
And subsequently:
"But, sir, as I have before intimated, there is an error in
the financial statements of the Secretary's report It is but
justice to say that it was first discovered in the Committee
on Finance, and it is due to iny friend from Vitginia [Mi
Hunter] to lemark that from him first came the suggestion
as to the nature of the mistake. It was communicated to
llife department fust verbally, and afterwards (on the 25th of
February) by letter to the Register of the Tre&^my."
It seems to be considered of great importance by
the honorable chairman who it was that "first dis-
covered" this errOr. I do not consider it an evi-
dence of very wonderful astuteness to discover
mistakes in the reports of the Secretary of the
Treasury; the wonder is, that he should have made
them. If, however, a patent is to be issued for
this discovery, I shall claim the letters patent my-
self. Long before the time referred to, I pointed
out these errors to the officers of the Treasury, and
the Register of the Treasury furnished me, under
his own hand, the statement on the subject, which
is printed at length in the published copy of my
former speech, which he furnished as showing that
the error had not been committed, anci not to show
how it had been made.
It may well be asked, whether this is all?
Whether the error is not still greater5 Whether
the Secretary has withheld enough from market?
Whether there is not now an over issue of treas-
ury notes? If this is so, who is responsible? Can
the Secietary relieve himself by talkingof registers
and clerks? If so, it is time that Congress make
their own examinations.
But, sir, although I am exceedingly unwilling
to tiespass again upon the time of the House on
this subject, the course which has been taken
leaves me no choice; I cannot permit the matter
•to rest here. This acknowledgment of mistake,
tardily and reluctantly given, is itself, I think, short
of the truth, and no answer is given to the other
errors and discrepancies which I pointed out.
There is appended to the speech of the honorable
chairman an official statement from the Register of
the Treasury " explanatory of the loans and treas-
ury notes authorized by acts of 1846 and 1847."
Upon this statement al! the facts and figures of the
chairman of Finance m the Senate on the subject of
treasury notes are based. Every statement made
by him is but a combination, in one form or other,
of the figures contained in and derived from his
statement. This is also the same statement which
was furnished me by the Register of the Treas-
ury, and which is printed at length in my former
speech.
I propose to show, from the tables connected
with the report of the Secretary of the Treasury,
and statements since furnished by the department,
in whole and in part, m the results and 111 the de-
tails, this statement is entirely erroneous.
Since I last addressed the House on this subjcct,
I find that the attention of the Committee on Pub-
lic Expenditures has been called to it. One of the
members, my honorable friend from Pennsylva-
nia, [Mr. Strohm,] a most intelligent and compe-
tent gentleman, has spent much time and labor in
the investigation, and has obtained from the books
in the department an accurate statement of facts
and figures on various points, and especially in
relation to the treasury notes and loans under the
acts of 1846 and 1847. This statement he has fur-
nished me. The points of inquiry were presented
by himself. A portion of the answers were fur-
nished to him personally by the officers in the
department and taken down by him, and the resi-
due were subsequently furnished by those officers.
I need not say to those who know him that the
honorable member has given the subject a most
intelligent and thorough examination,and that the
results of his labois are of great value. I shall
have frequent occasion to refer to them.
The following is the statement of the Register of
the Treasury, to which I have referred, and eacli
part of which I propose to examine separately:

&«>3.<}0U.U0u 00
The first entry is: "Amount received for tieas-
* ury notes and loans, under acts of 1846 and 1847,
i during the fiscal year ending 30th of June, 1847,
1 per Secretary's report, $25,679,199 45."
This is the same sum given by the Secretary of
t the Treasury, in his official report, on the first
| page, under the head of " receipts and expendi-
j tures forthe fiscal ending 30th June, 1847.
! By table A, accompanying that report, is given
' a detailed " statement of the duties, revenues, and
public expenditures during the fiscal year ending-
June 30, 1847, agreeably to warrants issued, ex-
clusive of trustfunds." This table purports, among
other things, to contain the items of this sum of
§25,679,199 45, which areas follows:
Avails of treasury notes issued under act of July 22,1846>
after deducting $1,931,000, which were funded under the
act of January 28, 1847  §5,506,800 00

January 28,3847,after deducting§1,221,850,

after deducting $40,350, which were fund-
ed  4,134,950 00
.$25,679,199 45
A statement, still more in detail, has been fur-
nished to the Committee on Public Expenditures,
from the books fit the treasury. The amount of
treasury notes which are here stated to have been
"funded under act of January 28, 1847," of
$1,931,000, appears, by the statement procured for
the Committee on Public Expenditures, to have
been gl,fi83,300—a discrepancy of £247,700.
The sum said to have been funded in the second
entry, of $1,221,850, appears, from the same au-
thority, to have been $1,132,550—a discrepancy of
§89,300. F *
These together show the error in the report, if
the figures furnished at the department be correct,
to be §336,000.
The fourth item is " avails of loan under the act
of January 28,1837, aftei deducting §40,350, which
were funded, $4,134,950.'"
This item appears to be composed of the follow-
ing amounts:
Treasury notes, per aft of July 23,1846, funded.. $1,683,300
