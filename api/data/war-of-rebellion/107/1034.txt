Major-General, Commanding.

MAY 2, 1863.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Commanding Third Division:

GENERAL: The major-general commanding desires, as soon as you are supported by Brigadier-General Mott - and before if in your judgment it is practicable - a small force, to be left to your discretion, should be sent up the river road, with directions to proceed cautiously and ascertain if there is any appearance of the enemy in your immediate front. Particular instructions should be given to them, in case they are driven in, to return in such manner as not to mask the fire of the batteries. Major-General Couch reports indications of the enemy massing in General Hancock's front, which is on the plan road and old turnpike.

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Major-General BUTTERFIELD,

Chief of Staff:

General Reynolds' movement will be a little delayed in consequence of the heavy shelling they have given him. His infantry have been in motion for some time, and the whole movement will be pushed.

Major-General.

HEADQUARTERS FIRST ARMY CORPS,May 2, 1863-11.05 a. m.

General SEDGWICK:

The troops are all across and moving up the road. The bridge is on this side and being taken apart. The enemy interfered in no way except with his artillery, one shot striking the bridge while the troops were crossing, delaying us until a new boat could be put in. I report that pontoon bridge will be piled on this side and left. There are no trains to haul them off.

John F. REYNOLDS,

Major-General.

MAY 2, 1863.

Major HANCOCK,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

The hill in front of General Zook's picket-line and to the left of the road I think can be easily taken by a strong skirmish line; if it was gained it would be a very important point, as there is an open field
