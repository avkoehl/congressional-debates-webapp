Four refugees arrived here to-day from Lynchburg, via Gordonsville, Culpeper, and Warrenton. They report Mosby re-enforced by two brigades of infantry who marched two days ago past Warrenton in the direction of Haymarket, and saw their camp-fires last night at the Bull Run Mountains on their way here. I have seven companies of cavalry continually scouting and patrolling in front of our lines from the Potomac to Wolf Run Shoals day and night.
