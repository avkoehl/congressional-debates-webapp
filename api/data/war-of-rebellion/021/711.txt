HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE GULF,Brashear City, April 30, 1863-6 a. m.

Major-General GRANT:

DEAR SIR: I modify my dispatch sent by the admiral* so far as to recommend the union of our forces on the Bayou Sara. My fear was that our supplies could not be made secure, but upon further reflection I am satisfied that with the force you propose to send and my own we can march directly to the rear of Port Hudson and thus open communication by the way of Baton Rouge for all supplies. In this view the Bayou Sara route is the most feasible. We are anxious to hear from you. There is no news here.

Very truly, yours,

N. P. BANKS,

Major-General, Commanding.

ATCHAFALAYA RIVER, STEAMER SYKES,

April 30, 1863.

Major-General GRANT:

DEAR SIR: It is of the utmost possible importance that you should send a force ot the Red River immediately to co-operate with Army and Navy now here. We have the Atchafalaya and the month of the Red River. An addition to my force now will give us the whole country west of the Mississippi.

Please give me all information of your movements in this direction. Very truly, yours,

N. P. BANKS,

Major-General, Commanding.
