Captain A. C. RHIND,

Commanding U. S. Stemaer Agawam:

I expect within two days to move some stermers with flats in tow up the Neuse to Kinston, if I shall be in possession there; otherwise to such point ont e river near there as I may reach. I have one army gun- boat at New Berne to convoy them. I understood from Captain Truxtun that you vessels drew too much water to go up the river, and therfore supposed it would be impossible for you to assist me. I exp3ct to learn definitely whether the ram reported at Kinston is likely to be used, before ordering the boats up. My object in moving the vessels is twofold- first, to bring up supplies; and second, to use them as a ferry or pontoon bridge, according to cimucmstances. If you can suggest any way in which the navy can co- operate I shall be most happy. The harbor master at New Berne can give uyoufull particualrs.

I wuld like to have all the rations you do not use which are now at the railroad near
