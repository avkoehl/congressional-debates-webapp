The next amendment was to insert " addi-
tional salaries of" before ''officers," in line
thirty-one.
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. POMEROY. As the section has now
been amended I do not see that any salary is
fixed for these officers.
Mr. FESSENDEN. The salaries of the
officers of these several grades are now fixed
by law.
Mr. POMEROY. Then it is all right.
Mr. FESSENDEN. I move to add at the
end of this section the following:
And this section shall take effect from and after
the 30th day of June, 1866.

ized to make all necessary regulation? and proscribe
all necessaiy forms and proceedings for the collection

penalties for the execution of the provisions of this

The Committee on Finance proposed to

lieu of it to insert:
Provided, however, That all tho provisions of said
acts shall bo in force for collecting all taxes, duties,
and licenses properly assessed or liabioto be assessed*
or accruing under the provisions of acts, the right to
which has already accrued or which may hereafter

tinuing liens, fines, penalties, and forfeitures incurrod
under and by virtue thereof, and for carrying out and
completing all proceedings which have been already
commenced or that may be commenced, to enforce

Mr. FESSENDEN. In tho third line of the
section 1 move to strike out the word "July"
and to insert "August."
The amendment was agreed fo.
The Secretary read the next and last section
of the hill, as follows :
Skc. [71 j 00. And be il further enacted, That it shall
be the duly of the Commissioner of infernal Rev-
enue to have this act, and the acts to which it is
amendatory, published in at least ono German news-
paper in each of tho Slates of tho Union where such
paper may bo published.
The Committee on Finance reported no
amendment to this section.
Mr. FESSENDEN. There are some amend-
ment that 1 wish Jo surest. One of them is
on page lf"W, in line twenty-three hundred and
thirty four of section nine, to strike out the
proviso, which extends to line twenty-three
hundred and forty on the next page. It is
found that although the rule is well in ono
part of the country it does not work in another.
The words proposed to bo stricken out were
read, as follows:
Provided, That in all cases in which such ware
shall be delivered to agents or peddlers employed by
the manufacturer for tho disposal of the same, such
ware so delivered shall be deemed to have been sold
at the time of deli very, and the tax to be paid thereon
shall be computed upon the value known to tho trade
as the live-pound rate or price for fm-ware.
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. FESSENDEN. On page ICS, in line
twenty-four hundred and fifty of section nine,
I move to strike out *k ready-made*' before
"clothing," so that the clause will read:
On clothing, gloves, mittens, moccasins, caps, felt
hats, and other articles of dre>s for the wear of men,
women, and children, not otherwise assessed and
taxed, a tax of two per cent. <td oaloi em.
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. FESSLvDEN. J propose on the same
page, after line twenty-four hundred and thirty-
nine, in relation to the tax on f'ius, to add the
following proviso :
Provided, That on all articles made of fur, tho
retail price of which shall not exceed twenty dollars,
a tax of two per cent, only shall be paid.
The amendment wac agreed to.
Mr. FESSENDEN". On page 11*, in line
twenty-six hundred and ninety-five of section
nine, the amendment there by the committee
inserting "this act" in place of tho words
''the act to which this is an amendment" was
not concurred in. On examining the matter
I think it must be considered as the previous
act, inasmuch as it is simply amending that
