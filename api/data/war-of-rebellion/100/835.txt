GREENSBOROUGH, N. C., April 24, 1865-6. 30 p. m.

Honorable JOHN C. BRECKINRDIGE,

Secretary of War, Charlotte, N. C.:

I have just received dispatches from General Sherman informing me that instructions from Washington direct him to limit his negotiations to my command, demanding its surrender on the terms granted to General Lee, and notifying me of the termination of the truce in forty-eight hours from noon to-dah. Have you instructions? We had better disband this small force to prevent devastation to the country.

J. E. JOHNSTON,

General.

CHARLOTTE, April 24, 1865.

General JOSEPH E. JOHNSTON,

Greensborough, N. C.:

Does not your suggestion about disbanding refer to the infantry and most of the artillery? If it be necessary to disband these they might still save their small-arms and find their way to some appointed rendezvous. Can you not bring off the cavalry and all of the men you can mount from transportation and other animals, with some light field pieces? Such a force could march away from Sherman and be strong enough to encounter anything between us and the Southwest. If this course be possible, carry it out and telegraph your intended route.

JOHN C. BRECKINRIDGE,

Secretary of War.
