Your dispatch in reference to sending forward batteries and wagons of Thirteenth Corps is received. You have no idea of the different and scattered detachments left here from the Thirteenth Corps that no one seems to be in charge of.

There is also great delay in sending back the steamers, but I am in hopes to get everything ready to leave here by 10 o'clock to-morrow.
