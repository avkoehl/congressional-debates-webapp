1834.                                THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.                                   2^7
Mr SEVIER protested against the use of the
opinion of the Secretary of War as an oracle in
this House, though he had (he said) as much
respect for the Secretary as ai y othei gentleman
He went on to speak at some length in support of
his motion
Mr WATMOUGH supported the motion, and
contended that no precise information had been
given by the Committee of Ways and Means for
dissenting from the Committee on Mihtary Affairs,
whose opinion he thought was entitled to as much
weight as that of the Secretary of War The
opinion of the people of Arkansas, as expressed
througn their representative, was also entitled to
respect
Mr GILMER said it was highly important to
the success of the plans for meliorating the con-
ditions of the Indians, that they should cease to
entertain any jealousies of us The Choctaws
and Cherokees were, essentially, peaceful m their
habits and feelings, their wailike spirit had been
broken down It was now necessary to remove
from them the apprehensions which they enter/-
tain of our confrol by withdrawing our troops
A small force only is necessary to be retained in
the Indian countiy to prevent collisions between
the different tribes themselves He did not think
it advisable now to withdraw the post, but he
was in favor of reducing the appropriation to
§5,000
Mr POLK said that it was plain that if the
po&t was to be continued at Port Gibson, some
arrangement ought to be made for the accommo-
dation of the troops there stationed The Secretary
of War stated that the post could not be safeiy
removed from Port Gibson, and he certainly
understood the locality of the post, the situation
of the Indians, and the proper means of defending
the fiontier, as well as any gentleman here
After some further remarks from Messrs
WATMOUGH, HUBBARD, ASHLEY, and
DUNCAN,
Mr GAMBLE moved that the committee do
rise
The motion was rejected—yeas 65, nays 81
Mr CLAYTON then contended that the best
location for a fort would be on the western line,
between the lands occupied by the Choctaws and
the Territory of Arkansas
Mr   GORHAM said that the communication
made on this subject  by the Secretary of War
to the Committee of Ways and Means, was pred
leated on the assumption that Port Gibson was
to be heieafter a permanent military stition     He
did not think, unless the House was prepared to
assent to this, that so large an appropriation as
tw. enty five thousand dollars was necessary, tweh e
01 fifteen thousand would be sufficient to ke p the
present buildings m repair for two or thiee year¡ , '
after which, if it should be found necessary to .
keep it up ab a permanent m litary s atnn, then '
v. ould be the time to make the large erections tnat
weie contemflated
The question on the amendment proposed by
Mr  SE\ IER vas put, and rejected
Mi HORACE FVFRrTT theieunon moved
to s rute out the appropria ion for eiec'irg addi-
tional works, &c , at Port Gibson, $25,000, and
to insert "for making temport<-y repairs there,
£5,000 " which was agreed to                                   '
Mr POLK saul, is, the appropriation of ten f
thousand dollars for the erection of new barracks
at }ort Annstione, also of the same -unount for

tion such a dpctnne as the insertion of such matteis
into their bills making npptopriations He thought
that the franking privilege ought to be curtailed
rathei than enlarged
