HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY BRIGADE, August 25 [1862]-12 midnight.

General McDOWELL:

I am sending my trains to the rear because General Sigel is moving to Warrenton, leaving nothing at Hedgeman's River. General Milroy says a large column of cavalry crossed at Miller's Ford to-day.

I have sent one regiment in the direction of Miller's Ford, another to Waterloo Bridge, and have scouts toward Salem. If the enemy advances I can do very little. My command is almost disorganized.

JNO. BUFORD,Brigadier-General, Commanding Cavalry.
