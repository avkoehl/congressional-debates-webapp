Major-General, Commanding.

HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,

Kingston, Ga., May 19, 1864.

General THOMAS,

Commanding Army of the Cumberland:

GENERAL: I am satisfied that if there be any force in front of you it is a division of Cheatham's that said here last night. It should not escape. Garrard's cavalry is now moving for the bridge across Etowah, with orders to hold it. Press down on that force and order Hooker the same. It should not escape us. McPherson holds his command ready, but you have now enough for lines five miles long. Both Murray's and Garrard's cavalry are at the bridge guarding it from both sides, with orders to feel forward toward the east.

Yours,

W.T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,

In the Field, Kingston, Ga., May 19, 1864.

General THOMAS,

Commanding Army of the Cumberland:

GENERAL: I feel certain that Johnston, after the affair at Resaca, does not want to fight us in the comparatively open ground this side of Cartersville. I send with this orders for General Schofield, which is a repetition of orders heretofore sent him by courier to press down to the road, and to order General Stoneman to secure the passage of Pettit's Creek, this side of Cartersville. General Garrard's cavalry is now at the bridge across Etowah, and Murray is coming to you to connect with General Hooker. Do you want General McPherson forward? He has his troops so he can advance by two roads. Send me word. I will come forward in that event. Connect with General Hooker, and, if possible, crush or capture any force that is, as I think, caught between General Stoneman and you.

Yours, truly,

W.T. SHERMAN,

Major-General Commanding.
