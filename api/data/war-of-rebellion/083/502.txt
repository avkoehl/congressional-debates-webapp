The reports of Major McKenny and Major Hunt are especially interesting, but the extracts here made seem to cover the entire field and facts, and I refer to theirs and others here submitted as well deserving of general perpetuity.

BATTLE OF CHARLOT, OCTOBER 25, 1864.*

General Price's rebel army, being closely pursued after the battle of the Osage, continued a rapid retreat. Leaving the Fort Scott road to the right and bearing a little east of south his movement soon rendered it certain that this most important post of Southern Kansas and the last in my department was entirely safe. Our advance under General McNeil, commanding advance brigade of General Pleasonton's division, pressed forward in rapid pursuit. Our way over the prairie was plainly, graphically marked by the scattered equipments, wagons, guns, utensils, and animals left by the rebels, and the fire and smoke created by their burning of the hay and grain and grass along their route. As the passage of the Marmiton, which we now approached, presented a new obstacle for the enemy's encounter he made another stand at this stream. This was to cover the passage of his train, which was a great incumbrance in view of our rapid approach. General McNeil attacked him vigorously with his own brigade, holding him for some time. He was then assisted by Colonel Benteen's, which came up at full speed. The enemy showed a line far outflanking McNeil, and General Pleasonton immediately sent back for re-enforcements. I met General Lane on this duty, who was earnest in his efforts to hurry forward the First Division, which was considerably in the rear, at the same time expressing his apprehension as to McNeil's ability to hold his ground until more forces could be brought up.

As I came near the scene of action, I saw our artillery and cavalry making a vigorous attack on the enemy's center, which soon broke his line and gave us a decided advantage. Still the enemy greatly outflanked us, and his wings continued the fight as the sun descended the horizon. Another effort on our left drove the enemy's right to the rear, and his lines slowly retired in the twilight of the evening. A large portion of our forces about this time were moving to the right, as I first supposed to turn the enemy's left flank, but continuing in the same direction quite beyond the flank, I rode rapidly to the head of this column to ascertain the object. General pleasonton told me that his troops were exhausted, and he was going to Fort Scott to rest and secure supplies. He was told, in my presence, it was only two or two miles and a half to Fort Scott, whereas in point of fact it must have been six. I protested against leaving McNeil and against any loss of distance in the march. I insisted on lying down on the grass and the advance to the right, and such was the cravings of hunger and the desire for rest, it seemed impossible to stop this movement to a place where both could be supplied. I sent word to General Blunt to hurry forward his division to support McNeil, but night soon came on, the battle ceased, and the lights of the burning prairie and the enemy's burning wagon train near the timber of the Marmiton was all that appeared of the two contending armies. Anxious to procure cordial co-operation between our forces, I went to Fort Scott and had a further
