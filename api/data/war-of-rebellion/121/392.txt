CITY POINT, VA., March 14, 1865.

General HOFFMAN, Washington, D. C.:

My dispatch to the Secretary of War applied to prisoners of war. Continuous reports of men being retained in irons are brought by prisoners going forward for exchange. I made a proposition applying to citizens, but received no reply. There are, I believe, a large number of prisoners in irons at Alton, Ill., who have been sentenced by military commission, who should be released under th agreement made.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

WASHINGTON, March 14, 1865.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Repeated orders have been issued directing all rebel prisoners in close confinement or in irons to be forwarded for exchange. It is not known that there are any now so held. Your telegram of the 23rd ultimo directs that citizen prisoners awaiting trail or under sentence shall be held till furhter orders. I write by mail.

Respectfully,

W. HOFFMAN,

Commissary-General of Prisoners.

WASHINGTON, March 14, 1865.
