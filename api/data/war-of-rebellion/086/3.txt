UNION CORRESPONDENCE, ETC.#

FORTRESS MONROE, VA., October 16, 1864-3 a.m.

(Received 7.05 a.m.)

His Excellency A. LINCOLN:

Have just arrived and will go on immediately. It has occurred to me to propose General Logan for Missouri or else for Hooker's present command, then General Hooker go to Missouri. What is your opinion in respect to this proposition? Expect to reach City Point at 9 a.m. Please let me have your answer.

E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.
HEADQUARTERS DEFENSES OF NEW ORLEANS,New Orleans, October 16, 1864.

Major M. MALONEY,

Commanding First Infantry:

Brigadier-General Sherman directs your attention to a more thorough execution of Special Orders, Numbers 95, current series, from these headquarters. The guards at the theaters will be re-established to-night. They must remain from the time the doors open until the close of the first act. An officer will command these guards. Day patrols must also be established at once. Your regiment will be required to perform little else during this winter in addition to the patrol duty. This must be at once thoroughly systematized, so that it will be, to say the least, very unpleasant for any person in the military service to remain in this city in violation of orders. A plan of operations should be adopted by you and submitted to these headquarters for approval. If the strength of your own command is not sufficient additional officers and men will be directed to report to you to assist. You are to take care that, in executing the above cited orders, the passes of officers are not demanded by non-commissioned officers or soldiers.

I am, sir, respectfully,

FREDERIC SPEED,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
