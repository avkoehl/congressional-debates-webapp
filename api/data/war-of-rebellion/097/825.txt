CAVALRY HEADQUARTERS,

Petersburgh, Va., April 18, 1865.

Brigadier General J. A. RAWLINS,

Washington, D. C.:

The cavalry is now going into camp near this place. My headquarters will be at this point.

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General.

WASHINGTON, April 18, 1865-10 a. m.

Major-General SHERIDAN,

City Point, Va.:

Some cavalry should be left at Nottoway and Burkeville if it can possibly be fed. As soon as you think this can be done return Crook's division to Meade. The moment it is determined you will not have to go south with the cavalry I will order to you old command or some new one.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

CAVALRY HEADQUARTERS,

Near Petersburg, April 18, 1865-7 p. m.

Lieutenant General U. S. GRANT,

Washington, D. C.:

The three division of cavalry arrived here to-day, and are comfortably encamped. At present I regard it as impossible to supply cavalry at Nottoway or Burkeville over the railroad, and I do not know how long this condition of things will exist. As soon as General Crook's division can be supplied there I will send it to General Meade. It should be allowed to remain here for a short time to recuperate the horses. They have been on short allowance of grain for some time without any long forage, and the animals are weak.

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General, U. S. Army, Commanding.

WASHINGTON, April 18, 1865-10.30 a. m.

Major General E. O. C. ORD:

Send two regiments of infantry to Point Lookout without delay. One regiment at least should get off to-day. It does not matter whether you send black or white troops.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

WASHINGTON, D. C., April 18, 1865.

Major General E. O. C. ORD,

Richmond:

Has the colored regiment ordered at 9.30 on the 16th instant yet started for Washington; and, if so, when did it start? Please answer.

JNO. A. RAWLINS,

Chief of Staff.
