as I could not tell the direction to establish a line and could not find the troops on my right I moved forward to the crest of a hill - a very good position; advanced a strong picket-line 150 yards and went into bivouac for the night.

October 1, threw up a line of works, connecting on the left with Colonel Harriman and on the right with General Hartranft. October 2, advanced from intrenched position in two lines of battle about one mile to the line left on the night of the 30th of September. Was ordered to the left to support a division of the Second Corps that was to assault the enemy's works. Returned to the vicinity of Pegram's house and threw up breast-works. From October 3 to October 8 remained in same position, continually strengthening our works by slashing and abatis. On the night of October 7, at 12 m., received orders to be ready to move in light marching order at 7 a. m. Moved, as ordered, on a reconnaissance about two miles to the left near the Hawks house and the rebel Fort McRae. Advanced in two lines of battle, my left resting on the Squirrel Level road and my skirmishers connecting on the right with Colonel Harriman, of the First Brigade. I deployed the Fifty-seventh Massachusetts Volunteers as skirmishers, and ordered the Third Maryland Battalion to their support; advanced nearly half a mile, driving the enemy's pickets until we passed beyond the house and woods in rear of house. Here the skirmishing was very sharp, and the Fifty-seventh Massachusetts was compelled to fall back to the house, having had 2 men killed and 9 wounded at one volley from the enemy's line of battle. Discovered the enemy's works about a quarter of a mile from where their line of battle was found, consisting of breast-works, redoubts, and abatis. Remained at the house, continually skirmishing, until dark, when I withdrew my skirmishers without further loss and returned to our old camp, having advanced our picker-line about 200 yards.

Appended please find a list of casualties.

Respectfully submitted.
