in the service of the Confederate States. The local defense men are according to terms of muster in the service of the Confederate States when called out, and it probably was better to organize them separately. General H. Cobb has been directed to attend to the organization of the troops you are about to furnish. While waiting for muster-rolls will be obliged to you for suggestions or nominations, all of which will be considered with deference. Georgia deserves the thanks for this additional evidence of the patriotism of her people. I am proud of her, and she has my gratitude. Will answer fully by mail.

Your dispatch has been considered; the position of Rosecrans and your opinion of his purpose indicates his plan to be to cause you to evacuate Chattanooga and then make his junction with Burnside. Your success must depend upon fighting the enemy in detail. If you cannot strike Rosecrans because of intervening mountains and distance, do not these reasons enable you to detach a sufficient force to crush the small army with which you report Burnside to have advanced to Knoxville and Loudon? This suggestion is based on your report.

General J. E. Johnston was permitted at his own request, by the Secretary of War, to attend session of court of inquiry. In consequence of necessity for all officers being at their posts, orders were issued some days since suspending the court.
