time, and would like to hear from you before I start. Neither the Eleventh nor Colonel Brisbin's regiment have arrived. I shall leave orders for them to push on and overtake me as quickly as possible.

N. C. McLEAN,

Brigadier-General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,Atlanta, Ga., September 20, 1864.

Major General O. O. HOWARD, East Point:

I consent that you give General Logan a leave. I have not yet heard from General Grant, but, in case of necessity, we can, in General Logan's absence, take care of the Fifteenth Corps. There seems a special reason why he should ho home at once.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

Major-General HEINTZELMAN, Columbus, Ohio:

This Department has just received information of the capture of two steamers by rebels from Canada, at Bass Island, Lake Eric. You will proceed immediately to Johnson's Island, and take such measures as may be necessary for the security of the prisoners at Johnson's Island, and call on the Governor of Ohio for such assistance as your may need.

Acknowledge the receipt of this order, and report you arrival at Johnson's Island and Sandusky.

(Received 6 p. m.)

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

Measures have been taken for the security of the prisoners at Johnson's Island. Since then have telegrams from Detroit that the steamer Island Queen has been sunk and the Philo Parsons plundered and sunk; the latter in British water. It is not necessary for me now to go to Johnson's Island.

This Department has just received information of the capture of two steamers by rebels from Canada, at Bass Island, Lake Erie. The object will probably be to release the prisoners there. Please render such aid as General Heintzelman may require for the security of the prisoners there.
