A. S. WEBB,

Brevet Major-General and Chief of Staff.

HATCHER'S RUN, February 6, 1865-11 a.m.

Major-General WEBB:

An officer of my staff who went out with General De Trobriand's reconnaissance reports that he found a skirmish or picket line of the enemy in an old line of works (ours) near the Watkins house, from which he drove them into their main line, in sight of which he advanced to. Seeing that his force was small they moved a force toward their right, apparently with the object of coming out and intercepting him. He changed his direction to meet this, and should they be induced to come out he will be supported and account for them. The reconnaissance from the Ninth Corps was in his vicinity, near the Watkins house. It has not yet reported. I have sent out to it.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General.
