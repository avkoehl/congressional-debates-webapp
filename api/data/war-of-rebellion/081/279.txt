HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,June 21, 1864-1 p. m.

Lieutenant Colonel F. T. LOCKE,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Fifth Corps:

I have incidentally heard that General Brooks has assumed command of the Tenth Corps, but have no official knowledge of the fact.

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,June 21, 1864-2.30 p. m.

Major-General Warren:

I send you a note* just received. There may be some misapprehension about this; but the fact is certain that General Griffin is not in position. I intended by my instructions this morning to indicate I desire you should extend your left as far as practicable with a secure defense. I wish you now to indicate to General Birney where your left will be, that he may put his right there. I wish you would get Griffin into position as soon as possible and begin entrenching. General Barnard is of the opinion that a battery may be placed in position in your front that will enfilade the enemy's works on the plank road and to the southwest. If this can be done its is desirable to have it executed and the effect of the fire reported to Birney, as, if we can make an impression on the works by artillery, Birney will try to carry them in front.

Respectfully, yours,

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
