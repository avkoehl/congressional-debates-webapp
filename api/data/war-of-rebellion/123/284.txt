WM. SPRAGUE.

NEW ORLEANS, July 29, 1862.

Major-General BUTLER:

MY DEAR GENERAL: I have your of yesterday. The proposal of the English gentleman I think you should not hesitate to accept.

The shipment of cotton, whether to Europe or to the loyal States, from the rebellious States, from such of their ports as are in the possession of our forces, is, I know, much desired by our Government. It was one of the principal advantages they expected to be the immediate results of the capture of this city. So anxious are they to attain the object that I am satisfied they would readily sanction such an the object that I am satisfied they would readily sanction such an arrangement as your note mentions. The question is, as you state, "rather a civil than a military one;" but as either, my opinion is that you answer it affirmatively.

With great regard, your obedient servant,

REVERDY JOHNSON.

INDIAPOLIS, IND., July 30, 1862.

His Excellency A. LINCOLN,

President of the United States:

Recruiting progresses fairly. Six new regiments are over half full. One will be in camp, full, Saturday; three more August 10; two more by 15th, and others by 20th or 25th. No arms or equipments here for them.

O. P. MORTON,

Governor of Indiana.

CLINTON, IOWA, July 30, 1862-10.30 a. m. (Received 1.20 p. m.)

SECRETARY OF WAR:

The Eighteenth Iowa Infantry, in camp here, has, by consolidated morning reports, over 900. This morning I shall consolidate some companies and organize the regiment next week. Shall I send the regiment to Annapolis or Washington? I hope Annapolis, as that has been my representation, and any change of destination will injure recruiting for new regiments. I wish to send via Chicago, Michigan Southern and Elmira. Shall I do so?

N. B. BAKER,

Adjutant-General.
