ORDNANCE OFFICE, WAR DEPARTMENT, Washington, D. C., January 14, 1863.

General W. S. ROSECRANS,

Headquarters Army of the Cumberland:

Three thousands sets of complete horse equipments have been ordered to be sent for you to Captain Townsend, Nashville, with the least delay possible-two thousand from Saint Louis, and one thousand from Pittsburgh.

JAS. W. RIPLEY,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Ordnance.

NASHVILLE, January 14, 1863-12.15 a. m.

ROBT. B. MITCHELL,

Brigadier-General.

MURFREESBOROUGH, January 14, 1863.

General MITCHELL, Nashville:

Notify Fort Henry to notify Fort Donelson that Forrest is in the neighborhood, and to look out. Perhaps it will be necessary to combine their forces. Is there a gunboat in the neighborhood?

ROSECRANS,

Major-General.

MURFREESBOROUGH, January 14, 1863.

General MITCHELL, Nashville:

Has Colonel Gillem gone out with the First Tennessee Regiment? What colonel commands those two regiments of Colonel Harlan? Give strict orders to the forces guarding the trains. Let a part of the force be in front and rear, the remaining part being in the center. Have the gunboats move down the river, keeping a good lookout, so as to be on hand if wanted at Donelson, if possible.

ROSECRANS,

Major-General.
