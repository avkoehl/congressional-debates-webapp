* ineedoiiyadiij what I have, ou sonnet  occasions, said
Senate.
on this subject, generally, that m the re^u a. jops whirii Con*
ffress may prescribe lespecting the custody 0. the public moneys
it isdesnable that as little disunion as may be deemed consis
tent with their safekeeping should be given to the Exerutive
agents No oae can b6 more deeply unpledged tlian I am with
the soundneess of the doctrine which restrains and limits, by
specific provisions, Executive discretion, as fai as it can be
done consistently with the preservation ef its. constitutional
charactei In respect to the control ovei the public money, this
doctrinéis peculiarly applicable, and is in harmoney, with the
gieat pimciple which I felt I was sustaining m the controversy
with the Bank of the United States, which has resulted in
seve mg, to some extent a dansorous connection between a
moneyed and political power Tne duty of he LegtsHtuie to
define, by cleai and positive enactments, the nature and extent
of the action which .t belongs to the Executive to supeuntend,
springs out of a pobcj ar Magoue to that w bich ei ¡01 is upon ail
the branches of theledetal Government an absu lenco fiom
the ext íoiseof powers not clearly granted In such a Govern
ment, possessing only limited and specific powers, the spirit of
íu  gen r ilddministiation cannot be wise m ju-st when it opposes
the leferenreofalt doubtful points to thegieat souice of au-
thority, the States and u s peonle, whose numbei and Jiversi
tied re ations, securing them against the influences and excte
ments which may misleai their asrents, make them the safest
depository of power In its application to the Executive, with
reference to the Legislative branch of the Government, ths
same rule of action snouid make the President ever anxious to
avoid the exprese of any discretionary a j thou ty whi**h can be
regulated by Congress The biases which may opeiateupon
him will not be so likely to extend to the Repr ¿.eniauves of the
people in that body "
In pursuance of these recommendation1*, my colleague
brought forward a propos tion for that purpose which became
a law, and which he now proposes to repeal Do not tho same
reasons exist now m favor of retaining it that existed when
Piesident Jackson first recommended it"? Most asMiiedly they
do Then why íepeal it? The Senator irom Missouri [Mr
Benton] eays if was first jecommended on account of the Urge
suiplus then on hand, and having none now, the eause for its
adoption has ceased to exist I say, not so 1 he Senator is
inibtakon There was no more surplus at the time this mea
sure was first recommended than we have reason to anticipate,
and ought to have, in ordinary times, to meet the cunent ex
penses of the Government We must not take the present state
oi the Treasury as the criterion of the future, unless ihe Execu
tive and his friends have deteimined, by then expeiimeut*, to
exhaust the ie=ources and dry up the revenues of the ooun ry.
There is every reason for die continuance of the law now that

tonentof poptdar indignation which would follow the onvic-
tion on the pub ic mind that the v> hole revenues of the country
were to be taken out of the custod> of the law, anddiawn within
tho absorbing vortex nf Executive discre. ion     He lehed upon
the prejudices which had been excited aeaii st the United States
Bank to justify the removal of the deposit, but there was no-
thing on which he dared rely to shie'd him fioi 1 the vengeance
of an abused dud confiding peopie if he should attempt to keep
them xvithin tho comrol of Executive discretion, instead of en-
trusting them to the custody of'he law    In his famous mani-
