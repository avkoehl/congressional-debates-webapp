HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Murfreesborough, March 8, 1863.

Major-General GRANGER, Franklin:

Advance at once firmly, secure your baggage, and establish courier lines, and keep me very frequently advised of movements and results. Steedman reports strong force in his front. If the force at Spring Hill is found to be insignificant, secure Franklin, and aim to strengthen Steedman's position.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

I do not understand your last telegram. I have called up Sheridan's command in order to advance early to-morrow. Force is too small without him. Have I understood? The road between here and Triune is almost impassable.
