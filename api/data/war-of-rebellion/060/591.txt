CEDAR MOUNTAIN, February 24, 1864.

COMMANDING GENERAL FIRST ARMY CORPS:

The smoke along Lost Mountain keeps constantly changing in position. I think it must be fire in the woods. Deserters report Lomax' cavalry brigade as being disbanded to recruit. No other change.

WIGGINS,

Signal Officer.
HEADQUARTERS DIVISION, February 24, 1864.

Lieutenant-Colonel TAYLOR,Assistant Adjutant-General:

A party of about 50 men, sent out to-day to bring in stray horses and stragglers, has returned. They discovered a strong picket on the road above Dranesville, and bring back the report that the enemy are 600 strong on Goose Creek. I shall send all the cavalry I can raise from Vienna to-morrow to scout in that direction. I think it probable that the enemy's force is considerable. Could not an arrangement be made with the Army of the Potomac to send a force above Goose Creek to try and cut them off from the mountains?

Brigadier-General.

Respectfully,

MATHEW MURPHY,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.
