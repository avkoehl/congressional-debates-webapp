It is very doubtful if he will be able to find a wagon road to that river below Fort Mojave. Six wagons have already come here from that point, and report a good road.

I judge the number of miners is about the same as that last summer, when General Clark was here; probably more of them Americans than at that time. Large numbers have come here from California, and returned, not being able to procure provisions. The trains with us sell their loading readily and at good prices. There is no flour here excepting what they bring. It sells at $30 per hundred.

There is great scarcity of water in the mining districts, having had no rains as yet. Those having claims think they will do well if they get water.

The Tonto Apaches have stolen a number of horses from the miners the past two weeks. I apprehend some trouble with them on account of it. Ten men of Captain Hargrave's company (C), First California Volunteers, were left at Fort Wingate, they being at the time of our departure on escort duty at Fort Canby. I would respectfully request that they may be ordered to join their company as soon as practicable.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

EDWARD B. WILLIS,

Major First California Infantry.
