I will call it up this morning during the morn-

Mr. SCOTT. Very well; letit lie on the table.

Wit AN GEL INDIAN- VILLAGE, ALASKA.
Mr. WILSON submitted the following reso-

consent, and agreed to ;
Resolved, That the Secretary of the Interior be
directed, if not inconsistent with public interest, to
transmit to the Senate so much of the report of Vin-
cent Colyer, special Indian commissioner, as relates
to the Indian village of Wrangel, Alaska, including
the accompanying illustrations, now in the hands of
tho Government Printer, showing the condition of
that village previous to its recent bombardment by
the United States troops.
Mr. WILSON also submitted the following
resolution ; which was considered by unanimous
conseut, and agreed to :
Jteaolved, That the Secretary of War bo directed,
if not inconsistent with public interest, to transmit
to the Senate the full report of the recent bombard-
ment of the Indian village at "Wrangol, Alaska, by
the United States troops stationed at that post.
loss of the oneida.
Mr. MORTON submitted the following res-
olution :
Jlesotved, That tlie Committee on Naval Affairs be
requested t>o report to tlio Senate joint resolutions
expressing the deep sorrow of the nation for tho loss
of theofficers and men on board the war ship Oneida,
expressing tho national admiration fortheirgallant
conduct, and expressing the national abhorrence for
the inhuman and brutal conduct of tho commander
of the Bombay.
Mr. THURMAN. Let the resolution be
reported.
The Secretary read the resolution.
Mr. CONKLING. I venture to suggest to
the honorable Senator that it might be well to
modify the resolution in the early part, com-
mitting to the committee the discretion to re-
port as proposed if, upon a review of the facts
by them, the facts shall warrant such areport.
'The latter clause of this, the Senator will see,
prejudges pretty fully the whole case.
Mr. THURMAN. The Senator from New
York evidently supposes that this is my reso
lutiou. I rose to say precisely what the Sen-
ator liom New York has said.
Mr. CONKLING. I understood it to come
from, the Senator from Ohio.
The VICE PRESIDENT. It was offered
by the Senator from Indiana, [Mr. Morton.]
Mr. CONKLING. I beg pardon.
Mr. THURMAN. And also to say that we
have as yet no official information on this sub-
ject. I was told last night by one who ought
to know that we are very soon to have an offi-
cial report on this subject. I submit that a
resolution containing such a clause as the last
one in this resolution ought not to be passed
on mere hearsay. If we were to act upon what
we have heard, undoubtedly I feel as much as
any Senator on the floor can feel what is ex-
pressed in that resolution; but in so delicate
a matter, a matter which undertakes to con-
sign to eternal infamy, as this resolution does,
the commander of the Bombaj', we ought not
to act until we have authoritative evidence that
the accusation is just. It may turn out that it
is just. But yet an officer of our Navy told me
last night that he could not conceive it possible
that the commander of the Bombay was guilty
of what is charged in the resolution; but still
it may be that it is so. At all events do not
let the Congress of the United States act in
this manner, and accuse men before they have
some official evidence on which to act.
Mr. MORTON. I supposed that the ques-
tion as to the culpability of the commander
of the Bombay was established. I was in-
formed this morning at the Navy Department
by a distinguished officer, not the Secretary
of the Navy, however, that the consular court
at Yokohama had found the commander of
the Bombay guilty and had sentenced him to
a mild punishment, he being suspended from
command for six months only. I am willing,
however, the resolution should lie on the table
until we can get further information.
â– Mr. THURMAN. That is satisfactory,
The VICE PRESIDENT. The resolution
will go over until to-morrow.
presidential approval.
A message from the President of the United
State's,by Mr.PoRTER. his Secretary, announced
that the President had on this day approved and
signed the resolution (S. R% No. 109) in rela-
tion to settlers on the late Sioux Indian reser-
vation in the State of Minnesota.
. . eastern oheroicees.
Mr. ABBOTT. Iunderstand that the Senator
from Nevada objected to the consideration of
a bill reported by the chairman of the Com-
mittee on Indian Affairs through a misappre-
hension.
Mr. STEWART. I withdraw the objection.
Mr. ABBOTT. I move that the bill reported
by the Senator from Iowa from the Committee
on Indian Affairs be considered.
The motion was agreed to, by unanimous con-
sent; Eind t-he Senate, as in Committee of the
Whole, proceeded to consider the bill (S. No.
646) providing for the payment of the expenses
of the delegation of the eastern Cherokees.
The Committee on Indian Affairs reported
the bill with an amendment to strike out all
after the enacting clause and insert:
That the Secretary of the Interior be, and he is
hereby, authorized to pay the necessary expenses of
Ueorgrrt W. Buihyhead, James BIythe, S. Mink, Wil-
liam Matoy, James Taylor, and David Tucker, dele-
gates of tho eastern Cherokees, incurred in visiting
Washington on business of the tribe, out of the con-
tingent fund of the Interior Department.
The amendment was agreed to.
The bill was reported to the Senate as amend-
ed, and theamendment was concurred in. The
bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third read-
ing, and was read the third time, and passed.
succession tax on charitable devises.
Mr. SHERMAN. I move that the Senate
proceed to the consideration of Senate bill No.
037. I ask unanimous consent.
The VICE PRESIDENT. Under the new
rule, it will require unanimous consent.
Mr. SHERMAN. Several Senators are in-
terested in measures covered by this bill, and
there are two or three pressing cases.
Mr. FERRY. I concurred in the rule re-
cently in regard to resolutions of the Senate
which are to be acted upon; but I have a res-
olution in regard to the consideration of trea-
ties, which I suppose will be passed without a
dissenting voice, from what I learn from the
Committee on Foreign Relations. I should like
to have that resolution taken up this morning.
Mr. SHERMAN. I will say to the Senator
that if this bill gives rise to debate I shall not
seek to press it now. It is a question of a
simple character.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Chair hears
no objection to taking up the bill mentioned
by the Senator from Ohio.
The bill (S. No. G87) to relieve public char-
ities from taxation, was read the second time
and considered as in Committee of the Whole.
It proposes to repeal all provisions of existing
laws whereby any tax or duty is laid upon be-
quests or devises, or transfers by deed, grant,
or gift, made or intended to take effect after
the death of the grantor, of any real or personal
property, in trust or otherwise, for public uses
of a literary, educational, or charitable char-
acter, or upon any real or personal estate which
may become subject to any such trust under
any past or future disposition, which, if made
in favor of an individual, would confer on him
a succession ; and no taxes heretofore levied
under such provisions of law but not paid are
to be collected.
Mr. POMERO Y. I suppose this bill relates
to internal revenue taxes. It does not relate
to the taxes of the States. It is drawn in such
a way that it would prohibit a State taxing
these devises or bequests, as it seems to me.
Mr. SHERMAN. There are three or tour
I cases, especially one in New York and one
