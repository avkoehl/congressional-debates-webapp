HDQRS. CHIEF OF CAVALRY, DEPT. OF THE CUMBERLAND,Burnt Hickory and Marietta Road, October 8, 1864.

General K. GARRARD,

Commanding Second DIVISION:

GENERAL: Your supply train can follow the Army of the Cumberland now moving to the Sandtown road and toward Acworth, a few wagons at a time taking supplies to you. General Sherman wishes the cavalry to follow the enemy beyond Van Wert to be sure he does not furn up to Euharlee; is willing he should attempt Rome. The operator at Resaca commenced to tell operator at Cartersville "Good news from Grant," when the line gave out before he could give particulars. I move my camp to or near Sandtown road.

HEADQUARTERS SECOND CAVALRY DIVISION,October 8, 1864 - 8 p. m.

Brigadier - General ELLIOTT,

Commanding Cavalry, Department of the Cumberland:

GENERAL: If General Sherman wishes to know if the enemy have turned up toward Kingston it can easier be found out by sending me to Euharlee from this point than be following their rear. The road from Dallas to Van wert is densely wooded and hilly and a small force can delay a long time. There is no forage on the road and the infantry can be three days beyond I could force my way through. If I go direct toward Kingston I can make time, obtain quick information, and get forage. I have ordered rations up and should be able to move tomorrow by 12 m. and be on the Eurharlee by early next day. Please let me know which I shall di, and if possibl the latter. It is in every way the best. I will also be on the flank of the army at Acworth, and if any of if go to Kingston can secure the bridges, &amp;c., for it.

K. GARRARD,

Brigadier - General, Commanding DIVISION.

Respectfully forwarded for the consideration of the major - general commanding.

The nature of the country as described by General G., with Kilpatrick's DIVISION to follow up the enemy to or beyond Van Wert and Garrard in the direction of Euharlee, both could be concentrated toward Stilesborough or the Etowah bridge.

Brigadier - General, Chief of Cavalry.
