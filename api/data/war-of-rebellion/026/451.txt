I prefer it simply because those words have hitherto been used in the certificates from the War Department.

With the very highest respect and esteem, I remain, dear general, truly, yours,

S. P. CHASE.
HDQRS. DEPT. OF VIRGINIA, SEVENTH ARMY CORPS,Fort Monroe, November 7, 1862.

Honorable SALMON P. CHASE, Secretary of Treasury:

Your letter of the 6th is just received. The Secretary of War has directed me to give no permits at present to make anything to or from Norfolk. Those I gave previously under your instructions have been dishonored by Admiral Lee, under instructions from the Secretary of the Navy. The Government owes it to me, to itself, and to the people of Norfolk, who are starving with under and cold, to do something. I am willing to give any certificate which will insure these people food, fuel, and clothing. The loyal portion of the people of Norfolk, and the Government employees not in the army are all suffering. Even the officers, who do not draw rations, are paying enormous prices for all the necessaries of life.

JOHN A. DIX,

Major-General.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington City, D. C. November 8, 1862.

Honorable GIDEON WELLES, Secretary of the Navy:

SIR: Will you have the goodness to inform me whether instructions have been given to Admiral Lee to pass staves and other products from Suffolk and Norfolk, on the permit of Major-General Dix, to go North for the purchase of supplies?

The accompanying telegram from General Dix is the occasion for the inquiry.

Yours, truly,

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

FORT MONROE, November 8, 1862.

Honorable E. M. STANTON, Secretary of War:

Am I authorized to permit the people of Norfolk and Suffolk to send North staves and other products to pay for supplies, and has the Secretary of the Navy instructed Admiral Lee to pas them?

Major General J. G. FOSTER,

Commanding Department of North Carolina:

GENERAL: When in Washington last week I was told by Major-General Halleck that re-enforcements had been sent to you and that you might perhaps move on Goldsborough or some point farther north,
