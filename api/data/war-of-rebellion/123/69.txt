Honorable EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Your dispatch received. Have sent the adjutant-general to Philadelphia to prepare the regiments of Gray and Blue Reserves and National Guards and detached companies in the First Division of the home guard of that city. I will take other measures for the organization of the military bodies in other parts of the State. I will keep you advised meanwhile. Telegraph further to- morrow, so that I can advise General Russell before he leaves the city to-morrow night. It would greatly facilite my recruiting operations if Captain Dodge were permitted to act as my agent in detailing volunteer officers with proper instructions in this service. Please authorize him so to act.
