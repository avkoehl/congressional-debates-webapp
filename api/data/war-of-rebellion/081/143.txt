CITY POINT, June 17, 1864-6.45 p.m.

Major-General BUTLER:

Your dispatch was received some miles out on the Petersburg road, hence the delay in answering. Smith has been ordered to join you to-night. You need not send Wright back till I direct. if possible the enemy should be driven back and the elevated point occupied by you this morning fortified and held. If Wright is no longer required you can relieve him to-morrow.

Major-General BUTLER:

Has anything been done this evening toward reoccupying the ground held this morning? I was in hopes after gaining the railroad you would be able to fortify a position that would command and render it useless to the enemy. If this is yet within your power I want it done.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
