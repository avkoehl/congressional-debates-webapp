APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
523
26th Cong......1st Sess.
Expenses of the Government—Mr. Benton.
Senate.
But the crowning consideration in favor of this
bill is, that it proposes an independent system—a
system whereby, if adopted, the moneys of the Go-
vernment will be under ihe control of the officers of
the Government, and atv all times on hand and
ready for Government purposes—whereby, also,
an  entire separation will be effected between the
Government and the banks, and the  numerous
evils resulting from their connection, which have
operated as a blight and mildew upon the prosperi
ty of the country, will be removed.   It-is this that
entitles it, in an especial degree, to the appellation
of a reform measure.   Such it truly is.   To appre-
ciate the magnitude of the reform it seeks to ac-
complish, it is only necessary to  trace, for a brief
per>od past, the operations of the financial systems
of this Government, which have prevailed.   Such
an examination must satisfy any candid mind that,
under those systems, the Government has been de-
pendent upon the banks—that the banks might, at
their pleasure, seriously embarrass, if not actually
bring to a stand, its operations.   A dependence like
this is a national degradation—a deep and damning
degradation in view of the disregard of all legal
and moral and honorable obligation, which has
marked the conduct of those institutions (with a
few honorable exceptions) of late years; and it is
also highly dangerous   to the liberties of (he coun-
try.   It will also appear, from such a survey, that
those systems exerted a powerful influence in pro-
ducing    those    unreasonable    bank   expansions
which have occurred in this country at brief inter-
vals, and which, necessarily followed by violent
contractions,have produced such wide spread distress
and desolation.   By the use of the public treasure,
the banks were excited to overaction—overaction
on their part aroused an "unregulated spirit of spe-
culation" in the community—a large portion of the
people ware led to embark in the most visionary
and ridiculous enterprises for accumulating proper-
ty; and high apparent prosperity prevailed through-
out the land.   At length the banks were called on
to fulfil their engagements—the process of con-
traction commenced—'the bubble burst, and little
remained of the fruits of speculation, save debt,
embarrassment, distress, and ruin.   This is but a
brief outline of a bank expansion and contraction.
They have been so frequent, however, that the ex-
perience of every man will enable him to fill up
die  picture.   Perhaps it is impossible to prevent
them entirely, while banks exist, but the system
proposed will, if adopted, remove one great cause
of them, and operate as an important check against
their occurrence.
There are other great evils inseparable from a
connection between the Government and the banks,
rendered plain and palpable by experience, which
th* passage of this bill would abolish. There are,
also, other advantages, than those to which I have
referred, to be anticipated from the adoption of the
proposed system. I will not take time to go into an
enumeration of them. I have already said as
much as I desired to in justification of my determi-
nation to act in opposition to the resolutions upon
which I have commented, and of the vote I shall
give for this bill. The purpose for which I rose is
answered.
Permit me, however, Mr. Chairman, before I
resume my seat, to say a word as to the prospects
of this hill, and to allude briefly to one or two re-
flections therewith connected. Sir, this bill is soon
to become a law. Within a month from this time
—I trust within half that period—the Independent
Treasury plan will be incorporated into our politi-
cal system. The people have willed it; they have
declared, in language not to be misunderstood, that
their Government "of right ought to be," and
shall be, independent of banks and the moneyed
power; and a majority of this body is ready to
carry their will into effect, and anxious for the
final vote. Nothing but the last words and dying
struggles of its opponents delays in triumph. And
what a triumph it will be! Go back to the first re-
commendation of it; see what impression the pro-
ject made at fust upon the public mind; trace its
progress onward; mark the hostility, the clamor,
the infinite variety and extreme severity of war it
has encountered. Never was a measure more bit-
terly and violently opposed.   The whole artillery
of the aristocracy, and the moneyed power, has
been brought to bear against it. Yet it has van-
quished all. The truth of its principles has led it
forward, "conquering and to conquer," until noth-
ing remains to complete its success but the declara-
tion of its victory.
In this triumph the great Democratic doctrine of
the honesty of the people, and their capacity for
self-government, will also triumph. The simpl
truths of the measure have won their convictions,
and led them to embrace it, in opposition to every
form of misrepresentation—in opposition to the
"subtle poison" of the moneyed interest; and not-
withstanding the severest pecuniary pressure and
distress produced by acting upon the odious and
abominable Federal doctrine, that "it is not by ar-
gument, but by sufferings, that conviction is to be
forced upon the minds of the people." It has been
a severe test of their integrity and capacity, but in
proportion to its severity will be the glory of the
triumph.
This lesson throws a broad and strong light on
the future. The view it affords is full of encou-
ragement to the friends of popular liberty. It shows
them that the people will act honestly and intelli-
gently; lhat they will treat the "log cabin and hard
cider" flummeries and fooleries of the Opposition
with the scorn and the contempt they merit. It pre-
sents to their admiring gaze the entire and total
rout and overthrow in the coming contest of the
combined factions of Abolitionism, Conservatism,
political Antimasonry, and Federalism, and the
brilliant victory of Van Buren and Democracy.
IN SENATE, Thursday May 7, 1840.
The VICE PRESIDENT submitted the follow-
lowing repoi t from the Secretary of the Treasury,
in compliance with a resolution of the Senate of
the 24th April.
Treasury Department,
May 4,1840.
Sir: 1 have the honor to submit this report, in
compliance with the following resolution, passed
by the Sauate on the 24th ult:
"Resolved, That the Secretary of the Treasury
report to the Senate the aggregate amount of all
expenditures or payments of every kind from the
Treasury in each year, from 1824 to 1839 inclu-
sive, in one column, and in another column for
each year the aggregate amount, independent of
the payments on account of the public debt,
whether funded or unfunded, and in a third co-
lumn, the aggregate amount for permanent and
ordinary purposes, excluding payments on ac-
count of objects either extraordinary or temporary;
such as the public debt, trust funds and indemni-
ties, claims of States for war debts or 3 per cents
en lands sold, occasional donations in money to ob-
jects in the District of Columbia or otherwise, sur-
vey of the coast, taking the census, duties refund-
ed, the Exploring expedition, and materials col-
lected for the gradual improvement of the navy,
durable public buildings of all kinds, bridges and
fortifications, all roads, canals, breakwaters, and
improvements in rivers and harbors, arminz mili-
tia and forts, all pensions except those to invalids,
and the purchases of title to lands from Indians, the
removal of Indians, and their wars, with such
other payments as may have been made in those
years for property lost or injuries committed dur-
ing any hostilities."
The resolution was on the same day referred to
the Register of the Treasury, with instructions to
prepare a tabular statement, containing the infor-
mation desired in three separate columns. It is
hereto annexed, marked A.
He was requested, also, to prepare another state-
ment, showing, the specific sum which had been
deducted each year on account of each item men-
tioned in the resolution as either extraordinary or
temporary.
Believing that this would be highly useful, as
showing the details on which the general results in
the third column of the first statement rest, and as
embracing many statistical facts, possessing in
themselves much interest, I have annexed it, mark-
ed B.
Unless some accidental omission or other error
has occurred, these two statements will present all
the information desired by the resolution.
With high respect,
LEVI WOODBURY,
Secretary of the Treasury.
To Hon. Rich. M. Johnson,
Vice President of the United States, and
President of the Senate.
