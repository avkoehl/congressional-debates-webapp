PETERSBURG, May 15, 1864 - 5 p. m.

General BEAUREGARD:

I think it fatel from difficulty of communication. It will be a week before Walker's brigade can get there, if then. Still, I think the enemy intends Petersburg, and that this move will seal its fate. All provisins and ammunition are behind this; 150,000 pounds of meat on the way.
