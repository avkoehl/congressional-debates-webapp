landing of telegraph cables.
Mr. CHANDLER. I move that the Senate
proceed to the consideration of Senate bill
No. 12.
The motion was agreed to ; and the Senate,
as in Committee of the Whole, resumed the
consideration of the bill (S. No. 12) to author-
ize the New York, Newfoundland, and Lon-
don Telegraph Company to laud its submarine
cable on the shores of the United States ; the
pending question being on the amendment
offered by Mr. Stockton, to strike out after
the word "that," in the third line of the lirst
section of the bill, the following words :
The New York, Newfoundland, and London Tele-
graph Company be, and the same is hereby, author-
ized to conlinue their existing submarine cable in its
several lines from the shores of Newfoundland west-
erly, and to land the same.
And to insert in lieu thereof:
Any telegraph company organized under the laws
of any State shall have the right to land.
So that the section will read :
That any telegraph companv organized under the
laws of any State shall have the right to land upon
theshoresof the United States at such pUce or places
as may from time to time appear to the directors of
the said company to be most convenient, &c.
Mr. CHANDLER. Ihope that will bevoted
down.
Mr. STOCKTON. Mr. President, I was
much astonished at the reply made by Sen-
ators on the other side of the Chamber to the
amendment offered by me when this bill was
before the Senate on a previous occasion. All
that I did was to ask that the provision which
they wished to apply to the Newfoundland
Cable Company should apply generally to all
other companies. I alluded to the fact that
Congress was now being asked for much legis-
lation on this subject; that there were several
general bills on the subject to which our atten-
tion has been and would be called. The reply
made by these gentlemen was that this bill
should pass first, for this was a pioneer com-
pany which had lost one cable and was entitled
injustice to some consideration. It was admit-
ted and stated on the other side, in argument,
that this company had an exclusive privilege
from the British Government or from New-
foundland; that both of its termini were on
British soil; and yet it was proposed, as a
matter of courtesy to them, of justice to tliem
as a pioneer company, that they should first be
taken and placed on the shelf before the prop-
osition was made to pass a general" bill. The
general bills, at least one of tbem, introduced.
I think, by the distinguished Senator from
Massachusetts, contain a reciprocity clause,
as it is called ; that is, that no authority sh ill
be granted to any foreign company to land a
cable on the shores of this country the com-
pany chartering which does not grant us the
the same privilege.
It is well known that there is a company
authorized by Franco to land a cable on car
shores who are now making their way toward
our coast. That company is to be made sub-
ject to this reciprocity clause; but this New-
foundland company, this pioneer companv. is
to be placed away on the shelf before the gen-
eral bill is brought into force. 1 ceitainl} wish
to do nothing unfair toward this pioneer" com-
pany ; but let me ask is it fair for this cmintiy
at this time that we should create wliai u
seems to me will be a perpetual inoiiop >iv,
with both termini on British soil.' it he
French company is not allowed to land ;ts
cable on our shores where will they go To
Canada. In the event of a war is it liglj! lo
our country that two lines of ocean cabin should
be laid without either one touching our slio:
I submit that in considering the claims of this
pioneer company we must not forget, to con-
sider our duty to our own country.
But., Mr. 1 resident, it was not on grounds
like these, but on grounds much high,.,, that t
place my opposition to the bill as it now stands. '
