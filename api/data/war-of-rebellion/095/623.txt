remained in camp, the picket duty was increased by the recent lengthening of the line toward the left. The health of the command was very good and the admissions into hospitals very few. Unfortunately but very few vegetables could be issued, and in the latter part of the month the patients admitted showed spongy gums and a few cases of scurvy appeared. The condition of the camps was good and attention was generally paid to policing. On February 24 the Thirteenth Pennsylvania Cavalry was detached from the division and ordered to Wilmington, N. C. The Twenty-first Pennsylvania was transferred from Third to Second Brigade. This necessitated a change of surgeons-in-chief of Third Brigade, Surg. R. T. Paine, Second New York Mounted Rifles, succeeding Surgeon King, Twenty-first Pennsylvania, in the Third Brigade, the latter going with his regiment to the Second Brigade. The following table will indicate the general summary of the sick and wounded during the month of February:
