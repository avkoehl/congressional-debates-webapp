HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI,May 11, 1865-3. 30 p. m.

Captain LAURANT, Warrensburg:

The troops up and down the river should be notified, and if there is any cavalry in reach get them after these. I think it must be a ruse to get across the river; at any rate, take no chance on it, but have every one prepared to defend the place. It does not seem possible for any large body to get there without our knowledge. What news have you of their force?

G. M. DODGE,

Major-General.

WARRENSBURG, May 11, 1865-6. 10 p. m.

Major-General DODGE:

Clement and Porter are known to be in Lafayette County. They have over 200 men. They have given the commander at Lexington till to-morrow to surrender, stating that if they took the town they would burn it and kill the soldiers. The Fourteenth Cavalry is ordered up but cannot be there in time to offer any assistance. In case of an attack all the cavalry in the district are in the field and cannot be reached in time. There are not ten mounted men left at this place.

C. G. LAURANT,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI,May 11, 1865-9 p. m.

Captain LAURANT, Warrensburg:

If there are not over 200 men the garrison at Lexington can whip them easy; at any rate, let every man and boy who can bear arms be brought into service there. Jim Porter was in Palmyra last night. This force no doubt intends to cross the river.

G. M. DODGE,

Major-General.

WARRENSBURG, MO., May 11, 1865.

Major-General DODGE, Saint Louis:

I left Lexington this morning and turned Major Davis with 130 fine, well-armed cavalry down Davis Creek to come in the rear of Cloment's and Captain Porter's bands. The demand for the surrender of Lexington is near the Gasconade. There are enough men there to hold the place against 700 or 800.
