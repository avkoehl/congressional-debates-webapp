Numbers 188. Report of Brigadier General James J. Archer, C. S. Army, commanding brigade, of operations August 24-September 2.
HEADQUARTERS ARCHER'S BRIGADE,Camp Gregg, near Fredericksburg, Va., March 1, 1863.

MAJOR: I have the honor to present the following report of the operations of my brigade in the series of battles from Warrenton Springs Ford to Shepherdstown inclusive:

WARRENTON SPRINGS FORD.

August 24, 1862, my brigade remained in bivouac in reserve in the edge of a wood until the division was relieved by Hood's division about sunset, and, although exposed to heavy shelling from the enemy's batteries, sustained no loss.

MANASSAS JUNCTION.

General Jackson, riding up as that time with a battery, ordered me to support the battery. The enemy was soon broken, and retreated toward the railroad bridge of Bull Run, closely followed by a battery and my brigade as far as the nature of the ground would permit the artillery to follow. I then, by order of General Jackson, sent the Nineteenth Georgia Regiment in direct pursuit, while with the other regiments I proceeded down the railroad track, and soon became engaged with the enemy, who made a stand on the opposite side of Bull Run at and near the railroad bridge. After about a half hour's firing I crossed the run and advanced about a half mile, when I was recalled from farther pursuit. I then recrossed the run and took a position on the hill commanding the bridge, where I remained until about 10 p. m., when ordered to return to the Junction.

My loss in this action was 4 killed and 17 wounded.

The regiments of my brigade were commanded as follows, viz: First
