So the motion that when the House adjourns
to-day it be till Monday next was not agreed to.
The question then recurred on the motion
of Mr. Schenck, that there be a call of the
House, on which the yeas and nays had been
ordered.
Mr. SCHENCK. I desire to ask the House,
by unanimous consent, to permit me and any
other gentleman who may desire it to speak
for three or five minutes in explanation'of the
position that we have taken, and then this whole
matter can be ended and the majority of the
House can dispose of the question as they
deem proper.
The SPEAKER. Does the gentleman de-
sire to ask consent for other gentlemen as well
as himself?
Mr. SCHENCK. I desire it for myself and
for at least one other gentleman, my friend
from Illinois, [Mr. Logan.] I desire only five
minutes, not to debate this question at all, but
to state why we have felt constrained to make
this opposition to the taking of the vote now.
If we be allowed the opportunity to make such
a statement we will then yield and permit the
vote to be taken.
The SPEAKER. Is there objection to per-
mitting gentlemen to make the statement indi-
cated?
Mr. RANDALL. Yes, sir; I object.
Mr. ROBINSON. I rise to a parliamentary
question. Inasmuch as the leading charge
against the President of the United States is
that he is obstructing the action of Congress;
and inasmuch as under the Constitution a
member of Congress is a civil officer, would it
be in order for me now to move, as a privi-
leged question, that the gentleman from Ohio
[Mr. Schenck] be impeached for obstructing
the action of Congress, and that he be sus-
pended from office during the pendency of
that motion? [Laughter.]
The SPEAKER. It would pot be in order.
The pending motion is that there be a call of
the House, on which motion the yeas and nays
have been ordered.
The question was taken; and it was decided
in the negative, there being—yeas 47, nays 114,
not voting 26; as follows:
YEAS—Messrs. Anderson, Arnell, James M. Ash-
ley, Baker, Benjamin, Benton, Boutwell, Bromwell,

So a call of the House was not ordered.
Mr. LOGAN. I desire to make a statement
to the House.
The SPEAKER. It requires nnanimous
consent to make a statement. The gentleman
has the right to make a motion.
Mr. LOGAN. If there is unanimous con-
sent I will make a proposition.
Mr. RANDALL and Mr. ELDRIDGE ob-
jected.
The SPEAKER. Objection being made,
the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. Logan] can-
not proceed.
Mr. ELDRIDGE. I would not object ex-
cept that I do not wish the gentleman to have
an opportunity to make an explanation of an
hour.
Mr. LOGAN. I do not want an hour; not
even five minutes.
Mr. BURR. I object on the ground that
remarks are not in order.
Mr. ROSS. I trust that I may be permitted
to make a suggestion.
Mr. BURR. I object.
Mr. WARD, I move that the House do now
adjourn: and on that motion I demand the
yeas and nays.
Mr. LOGAN. I believe I have the floor.
The SPEAKER. The gentleman can make
his motion.
Mr. LOGAN. I believe the objection was
withdrawn to my making a proposition.
The SPEAKER. It was renewed by the
gentleman's colleague, [Mr. Burr.]

nays; and there were—ayes twenty-nine ; not
oue fifth of the last vote.
