which I sent out drove in the enemy's pickets 3 miles out on Harlan road.

At daylight skirmishing parties of the enemy opened fire upon our right from the adjacent hills. The firing is now going on and the Minie balls are falling within our works. I have see no artillery. The snow is falling thickly and the morning is dark. Our men are in the trenches. The fire is a very thin one, and we have not returned it. One man is wounded.

Respectfully,

JAMES E. RAINS,

Colonel, Commanding Post.

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS,Cumberland Gap, March 22, 1862-11 a.m.

MAJOR:A line of couriers is established from this place direct to Knoxville; 2 men at intervals of 12 miles. The firing has ceased. Latrobe's battery has driven the enemy off, and the snow having ceased, we have a clear day. There need be no uneasiness about us. We have undoubtedly killed one of the enemy, and they have mortally wounded one of Colonel Morgan's regiment.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAMES E. RAINS,

Colonel, Commanding Post.

MAJOR:We have had a brisk fire all day. The enemy have planted five or six batteries on the ridge in front. They fire from rifled guns, and with much precision. Their balls fall within our encampment very thickly, but have done no damage as yet. We have 4 men wounded by Minie balls. I do not know the force of the enemy. Have seen as many as six regiments and one battalion of cavalry. Our men are in good spirits. Our artillerists are doing well. The fight is still going on.

Respectfully,
