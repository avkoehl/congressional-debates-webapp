THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
March I,
4 Brigadier Generals Haraer and Quitman of the operations
< of their respective brigades on the 21st of September last."
' As some of these documents relate to military operations
of .our forces which may not haye been fully executed, I
might have deemed it propei to withhold parts of them, un-
der the apprehension that their publication at this time would
be "detrimental to the public service;" but I am satisfied
that these operations are now so lar advanced, and that the
enemy has ah cady received so much information from other
sources in relation to the intended movements of our army,
as to render this precaution unnecessary.
