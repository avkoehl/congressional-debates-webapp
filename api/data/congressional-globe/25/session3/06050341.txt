25th Cong....3d Sess.
Interference in Elections—Mr. Preston.
Senate.
unappalled step, enters the very penetralia of the
temple of freedom, and gives this cup of pollu-
tion to the ofhcers themselves, and says, this is
the sacnfice, take no care as to your political
motive, which by admission is known to be un-
worty to exist, for though it ts thecormpt motive
of office seeking, it is not the less to be received,
and is even more to be valued than a regard for
the people
And now, Mr  President, have I rightly char
actenzed this repott?    I  have used perfect fice
dom with its doctrines, not to wound the gentle-
man, but the report itself sets an example of a
strength of language and  tone of denunciation
which doubly surpasses all to which I may have ,
been excited, and if, in the execution of this doc-
ument, diawn up in the closet, under a sense of
the íesponsibility of sending it abroad as the man-
ifesto of the leading principhs of the paity, if in
all this whatv/as due to eandot and decoium was
forgotten, stuely I may be indulged m some free
dom of remark on so  uncommon a production
But if I, foi woids used in denouncing it, should
fail off xcusp, and with the bill itself and the Sen-
atoi fiom Kentucky should also be denounced,
I will at least ask the indulgence of the Senate
when I spy great fieedom of debate ought to be
allowed on a document which is itself covered all
over with the spiwt of vituperation
I have nowpioved that the pi mci pie and policy
of the bill is not only contradicted and contra-
vened by the repoit, but that it justifies and eu
I  >gizes the inteifetence of executive officers in
elections and not only so, but prescubes it as a
dutv to be peifoimed by them all

Willing uisttunients oí corruption or ambition "
And yet it is settled by the repoit that these
officers may, in their own behalf, actas instru-
ments of coiruption, because it is for the public
good, and suiely ambition is not less piaise-
worthy     But furthei

We'l, sir, the officer is not to be thus degraded
and pievented fiom interfiling in elections, and
if he d íes not r< )cct his office under such condi-
tions with disdain, he is mercenary and coriupt,
and he is a fit mstuimtnt for power to use in
effecting its coirunt oi ambitious purposes, if he
will consent to be appointed to office on these
teims Yet the leport says that if he endeavois
to control and influence the polls foi the puipose
of attaining office, it does not disqualify him,
"all this is innocent and praisewoi hy, even if
the motive is the acquisition of office " but he
would be a mercenaiy and conupt tool if he
would foiego the privilege of interference
I will make one more remaik as to the inten-
tion of the commtttee in th.s repoit to contravene
the bill     On the eighth page tney say
" The enmm ttee will ontv advert to one other objection
to the policy of tl e bill
And what is the policy of the bill5 It is to
prevent interference in elections And vihat do
they say against the policy of the b IP
" its obvious tendency is to al cnate the people Aom tbe
Tederil Government, bdl'ii in,' a jealousv ol us piwcrs
and othcers, bv unjust discriminations betueenthe two sets
of funcuonaries chosen by tlie people to cany on the t,vo
coordinate depa-tmentsof the one single and integral Gov
ernment formed by tlie compact ot tire Slates , to array ibe
State government and its Junctional íes ngamst the rederul
Goven meut and lU function mes, and thus gradually to
undermine or w alten it, bvti eating as aliens the State gov
ernmenls to tno e who accept ornee under the General
ííoveriiment In short, us tondency would be to ' alienate
one po tton of the counttv irom the rest and to emecble
the sacred ties which now link together the various paits,'
and theie ore m tlie op nion of the committee, it ought to
-be resisted m the beginning "
Heie is the geneial summing up of the whole
repoit in a single sentence, in the la3t remark,
which embiaces and contiavenes the whole pol
icy and object which is at the bottom of the bill
itself    And what is that'    It is to prevent the
jealousy of the people against office-holders, and
what is especially taken for gi anted in this íeport
is, that the office holders and the people aie all
one, and this is done with a view to pievent that
very jealousy     Sir, what is the puce of our lib-
erty and of our ftee Government, and how are we
to sustain them '   It is by eternal vigilance aline
that the public liberty can be maintained, and it
is by this very jealousv, denounced and depre-
cated by this íepoit, by this jealousy alone, un-
slumbpnng and undying, that our foim of Gov-
ernment can be jireseivcd     It is passed into a I
pioverh that only by watchfulness and jealousy j
can a ftee goveinmcnt long be maintained   What
is Government, in is veiy natuie '   Is it not the
concentiation  of power from  the many in the
hands of the few, which is ever moie or less lia-
ble to be turned by them against the public lib   |
eity'    Aic not wc simply a pan of the Govern- ^
ment in whom power lesides, and have we not !
now unaiimousiy and exclusively acted on the !
ostensible ground of the jealousy of power, the !
one side denouncing this bill as tyrannical, and |
the other as a salutary and necessary measuie in
giving effect to this very jealousy ot power '  And
yet this repoit insists that the people must be
lulled, that they must not be sepaiated or alien-
ated fiom  their fellow-citizei s, the holders of
office, by any kind of jealousy, but íeceive them
to their bosoms as equal biothers in one common
interest, and be canted along on one common
stream of sympathy with office holders, and as
unsuspecting sacrifices, perchance, to the iron
embrace of a despot
Nor does this even give a full and sufficient
view of the argument of the report, which is, that
we should not be jealous of ourselves, nor di-
vided from ouiselves, and what more than this
could be said to lull us into security in regard to
the Government, and to close the eyes of the
people against the eternally encroaching spirit of
power?    What sort of an aigument is it to say
that this is to divide one poitionof the people
from the other, and to enfeeble the sacred ties
that link them together > What language is this'
The Government is to be pieserved by the strong
domination of aspnants, being regarded as sim   |
pie poitionsof the people of the country, and tint,
argument is pressed foi the puipose of blindfold
nig the people to the movements of Executive |
powei, as if it were also foi the purpose of sur
rendering our rights     Bind together poitions of ,
thecountiy'    And what portions'    The office   |
holders, the poumasteis, and the people, these
aie to be bound together, and they aie to listen |
unanimously to the sly office holders at elections,
embiace them as biotheis, and give them then
confidence, and wish them piospenty, and if this I
is not done, the tendency is to divide one portion j
of the country from the rest, and enfeeble the sa
cred ties that now link together its various parts ' ^
Ay, sir, these are the sacied ties of the office- |
holdeis and people which are bound around us,
and it ought to covpi our cheeks with shame that
we have permitted these ties thus to be put around
us     But let these ties, and those who make them,
bewaie    The time may come when the people,
perceiving the kind of brotheihood in which they <
aie linked, will snap these ties asundei
Now, I think, Mi Pr-sident and Senators, I
have shown that the policy of this measuie ndis
tmctly contiavtned bv the repoit, and that intei-
feience n the elections has, 1 y the highest con-
siderations of honoi and duty, been inculcated on
office-holders Inn, result has been leached in
an oblique manner by the committee, mthei than
by any dnect action on the bill itself And allow
me to remaik, though in no spirit of giving ot
1 fense,that I have come to the conclusion that thu
whole report is absolutely incompatible with the
opinions and principles of some gentlemen of the
Republican party, and it is not in the nature of
things that gentlemen who, in the earlier portion
of their lives, have been devoted topnnciples dif-
1 ferentfrom thoseoftheiesoiutionsofl798, should
come  to a just conclusion on the principles of
i those resolutions, or understand  the  premises
I fiom which they derive their deductions     Gen-
I tlemen who were Federalists m ancient  times
I now propose to build up a new theory of govern-
I ment on the doctrines of republicanism
I     Mr Piesident, it may not be, His not possi-
ble, that he who in his youth has been indurated
I m his advocacy for power will be found m his
age with a disposition to pull down that power
These principles of fieedom are peculiarly conge-
] mal to the counsels of young and aident bosoms
But when in early life all this has been rejected,
when the youth of twenty one does not feel the
1 fiie of Grecian and Roman liberty, he may, m-
' deed, believe in aftei life that ho is approaching the
great doctunes of republicanism     Bat it cannot
be     In youth and age it is the same in politics
as in love, and for a man to grow lepubhcan hy
age is equally absuid as if he should pass his
youth in utter coldness and apathy to the feeling
I of love, and then in his old age should assume or
' affect the passions and emotions appropnate to
, his younger years     It cannot bo
It has been said that the j oung man who is not
a Demociat is a fool, and the old man who be-
' comes so is a knave It is the natuial tendency
of things 1 can well imagine that in youth a man
I may struggle against free notions, and in after life
I he may endeavoi to squaie Ins punciples to the
I state of things in which he finds himself undei
free institutions and, while h s heait grows cold
and his head hot, he may fancy that he is changed
in his political principles but it is altogether a
mistake Once a Federalist is always a Federal-
ist, and I ventuie the assertion that no gentleman
who in his younger days has denounced the ti uth
of the resolutions of 1798, and seceded fiom them,
whatever may be his motives, will find his heart
warm toward them in after life And therefore I,
for one, who was born under the influence of
these punciples, had them infused into me during
the whole of my youth, and have cherished them
ever since as the bieath of life, will not permit
myself to be schooled in these doctunes by those
who in their youth have been devoted to different
and opposite principles Not that I intend these
remarks but in the most general sense, for I am
not one of those who denounce the Fedeial paity
fhey were a high-minded, intelligent, and gen-
eious party But they were wiong, though thev
I were apparently following that great light of a
glorious horizon who was regaided as one of the
paity But even if theirs weie the notions of
Washington, I humbly think those notions were
1 wrong, and I do not believe them I have re-
jected them from my earliest days, and have
adopted the resolutions of 1798 On these reso-
lutions gentlemen propose now to proceed and I
have discussed then construction and application
of them, contrasted with their construction and
application by the feenators fiom Kentucky and
Vnginia, [Messrs Criti laden and Rives,] who
[ are both i ative to these resolutions They may
be mistaken, but I would in preference cling to
them, and I am not to be told that snoh gentle-
men as thev are are to be schooled by those who
¡ have ever differed fiom tht m on the great princi-
ples on which oui Revolution and Government
were founded
And now, sir, what application has been made
of these glonoiis principles in the present case'
And what aie the punciples of the lcsolutions of
1 1798, and for what purpose were they drawn up
I and adopted'    It was on a question between the
I State and Geneial Governments in respect to their
relative powers and then object was to define and
hy down the legitimate poweis of the General
Goveinmei t, foi the puipose of vindicating the
rights of the States, and of companng them with
tho«e of the Geneial Government   And what did
i those íesolutions inculcate'   They urged restric-
tion upon this Government     This Government
had tianscended its powers, by abstracting and
appropriating to itself the powers of the States,
