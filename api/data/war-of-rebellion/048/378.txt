of the First [West] Virginia drove in the enemy's pickets on the Gainesville pike to within 1 1/2 miles of Gainesville, where a strong force of the enemy's cavalry was found. A portion of the Fifth New York drove in the enemy's cavalry pickets 1 mile to the left of New Market, and soon came upon a line of infantry pickets facing toward New Market and Gainesville. Cavalry bugles could be distinctly heard inside the infantry pickets in the direction of Bristoe from New Market. General Davies is of the opinion that a large force of cavalry supported by infantry is now encamped between Gainesville and Manassas. I can learn nothing of the enemy from the direction of Aldie, save Mosby's cavalry.

I am, general very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. KILPATRICK,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers.

COLONEL: A rebel soldier has just been brought in belonging to the Fourteenth Alabama Infantry. He was taken at a house between the dirt road and railroad, not quite three-fourths of a mile from New Market. He represents that his division (Anderson's) came up last night from the direction of Bristoe Station to a point this side of the railroad between the dirt road and the railroad; that the other divisions of Hill's corps were between Manassas and Bristoe; that his division formed an L with the other divisions of his corps; that his division was thrown off to its present position facing toward New Marked and Gainesville to prevent our cavalry from turning their left flank. He also states that Pickett's division of Longstreet's corps is now attached to A. P. Hill's corps. he furthermore states their wagon train left Warrenton night before last for Culpeper to procure supplies. He thinks it returned last night.

Very respectfully,
