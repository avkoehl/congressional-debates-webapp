WASHINGTON, August 18, 1864-3.20 p.m.

Major-General COUCH,

Bloomsburg, Pa.:

The Secretary of War directs me to say that your action in offering pardon to deserters is not approved, and that you were not justified in taking such action without proper authority. Send to Adjutant-General a copy of your proclamation or notice of such pardon.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

HARRISBURG, August 18, 1864. [Received 12.50 a.m. 19th.]

ADJUTANT-GENERAL U. S. ARMY, Washington:

By direction of Major-General Halleck I send you the following copy of a communication to the deserters from the draft in Columbia County:

Colonel J. G. FREESE, Bloomsburg, Pa.:

You are authorized by me to inform those persons in Columbia County who have not reported, as required under previous drafts, and are known as deserters, that the charge of desertion shall be remitted by me, provided they duly report themselves by, on or before 12 p.m., Saturday, the 20th instant. This does not include those charged with the crime of murder.

D. N. COUCH,

Major-General, Commanding Department.

General Fry probably received a letter from me to-day upon the subject.

D. N. COUCH,

Major-General.

GENERAL ORDERS, HDQRS. DEPT. OF THE SUSQUEHANNA, No. 45. Harrisburg, Pa., August 18, 1864.

JNO. S. SCHULTZE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

WASHINGTON, August 19, 1864-10 a.m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT, City Point, Va.:

One of General Augur's scouts insists that Longstreet's corps and Fitzburgh Lee's cavalry have passed through Culpeper, on their way to join Early. The information derived from this man has heretofore proved very reliable. If this be true, the enemy is too strong for Sheridan.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
