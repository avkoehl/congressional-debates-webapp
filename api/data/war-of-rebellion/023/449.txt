HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE OHIO,Cincinnati, Ohio, August 29, 1862.

Major General WILLIAM NELSON, Lexington, Ky.:

Adjutant-General of Kentucky has been notified to order Home Guards along Covington Railroad to stockade their posts.

N. H. McLEAN,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE OHIO,Cincinnati, Ohio, August 29, 1862.

Major General WILLIAM NELSON, Lexington, Ky.:

Am hurrying up regiments as fast as possible. The trouble is want of tents and equipments, of which there are none on hand. Have sent for Terrill, and you shall have him if his health permits.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General, Commanding.

LEXINGTON, August 29, 1862.

General WRIGHT:

It will require every soldier we have. People do not seem disposed to fight. Kirby Smith's game is now clear. He will assail Buell in left and rear. I ordered Dumont by telegraph last night to move to Nashville, it being my intention to mass the troops in front. That order I will countermand immediately. Dumont can move with all those down the road at once. Those at Louisville can be forwarded also. Mr. Guthrie should send an ample supply of mechanics. Transportation on the largest scale should be arranged at the depots on the railroad immediately. With energy the thing can yet be done in time. You will have to give orders in the premises. Let me urge upon you the vital importance of rapidity. I will go myself if it meets your approbation. Urge on the Governors of the States in your department the necessity of immediate aid, for I pledge you my word that if Buell is defeated the enemy will be in possession of Cincinnati in thirty days.

W. NELSON,

Major-General.
