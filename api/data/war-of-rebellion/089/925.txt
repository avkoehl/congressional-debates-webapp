GENERAL: The Church road station reports:

10.35 A. M.

There is now a column of infantry moving westward on Boydton plank road, nine minutes in passing a point 15 degrees west of north from this station. They apparently came out of enemy's front line of works north from this place. The column was well closed up and marched rapidly. Too smoky to discern any changes in enemy's camp. At 8 a.m. three trains of cars passed in direction of Petersburg on South Side Railroad. At 8.45 a.m. two trains passed out from Petersburg; could not distinguish the number of cars.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
