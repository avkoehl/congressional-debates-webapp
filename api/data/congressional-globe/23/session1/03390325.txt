no one siou'd give pledge*, for him, Representing
an independent peonle, he could not, he would
not, sutler any one to pledge him to ai y particu-
lar course
Mr HORACE EVERETT said, that if time
cou'd be web spent upon any subject it wat> upon
the appiopnauon bill He was awaie mat tie
sm jec' of ltform and mieiKhment had fallen into
disiepute, on account of the failu'e of foimer
attemp s to render it a poll ical hobby Bat this
would not deter him fioin voting for the pioposi-
tion He should vote for ti e reduction on the
ground that money is iorth much more et the
present time thin before At the commencement
of the session he would not have considered ti e
piesent salaries as too large, but those salaries
were now enharced by the increased value of
money at least twenty five pel cent Every one
would see that it was idle to send this subject to a
committee foi a report, at this stage of the ses-
sion
Some gentlemen had remarked that if we wished
to relieve tne people we must reduce the taxes
Bat there vas no expec'ation that the levenue
would be too large for the wants of the Govern-
ment, and, on the con'rary, it was his belief that
the Committee of Ways and Means would be
underthe necessity of proposing an incieaseof the
tariff m cder to laise a sufficient revenue
Mr G^LBRAITH opposed the proposition,
and pointed out the inequal tyand injustice of the
operation of the rule of i eduction pioposed The
reduction of puces on which the revenue was
founded, he entirely denied Piour was seven
dolíais a barrel when we came heie, ard it is
seven dolíais now He was very willing to con
seat to an investigation by a committee, of ti e
facts m regard to the sufficiency of the different
salaries, but he would not agree to vote for a
sweeping proposition as an amendment to another
bilr
Mi HARDIN said, that it had been objected
to the reduction proposed that it was a breach of
faith not to appidpnate money for a salary which
was fixed bylaw This objection would be avoid-
ed" by adding to the bill a clause lepeahng all acts
and parts of acts heretofore passed on the subject
But theie was a morepenous oojecuon with him |
He had voted against the allowance of two tnou-
sand dolíais to Doctor Beaumont and aga nst the
approDiiation of fouiteen hundred dollars for an
extra clerk in the Sta'e Department, for the rea-
son chiefly that he wis opposed to theintroduction
of anv extraneous matteis into an appropriation
bill But he was not entirely sa isfied that the
salaries ought to be reduced Some of them ought,
perhaps,and he would not, without furthei exami-
nation, tell which He was, besides, opposed to
the principle of raising or reducing salaries aecoid-
mg to the fluctuations of the currency It was
true that the minority could not originate any
pioposition, as in each committee they had but
two, or at most three members But he would
not break through the established rules on account
of the peculiar oigamzation of the House As to
the íevenue which had been spoken of, there would
be no surplus by the remission of which we could
rel eve the people We had now an unavailable
fund of 430,000 dolíais, to which wemigntadd
60,000 more from the fai'ure of banks in this Dis-
trict, and by December next, 500,000 dolíais irme
by the failure of othei banks to pay eveiy officer
of the Government amply and sufficiently
Mr VAISDERPOLL remarked that h.s col-
league [Ml Tilimorl] had urged his support of
this cro| osition on the ground that a reduction
had taken place ,n all the expenses of living But
was it tiue that any such leduction had taken
place? Was it true mat money had lately so
much indexed in v due, and every article of com-
foit or luxury depieciated m the SMlie proportion 
Had his colleague's landlady become conscience I
smitten, so as to reduce her puce of board below
ten or twelve ool ait, a wetri, o, whatever it was
accoidng to uis ori n a co, t,ar„ w üi her' If
he, from the conside-aions nt ntre uijes, should
feel disposed uilimatt'y to exact from her an abate
ment ot her price, 1 v ould, in jjstice to her, ad
vise him to accompany he to maiket on one of
these calm and dehghttu1 mornings, (and if she is
pretty,I am sjie,from mj colleague's known gal
lantry, it will give hi u cieat r easure to do so,)
and see her pay from foui to s x Yoik shillings
for a pair of chickens, ard from th.ee to four shil-
lings per pound foi butter, and for every other
article in tne same p<-opori'0", ard then let him
determine whether a d^l'ar vulgo so much farther
now tnan it would before 'he panic makeis began
their mischievous business He would fuitliei
refei to the puces cuitent in the late New Yoik
panels for pioof that the prices of many product 
had no' fallen, and he woJd par'icularly lefer him
to an extract from a papei, so orthodox now, in
the estima ion of h's colleague, that he vvou'd not,
h  was sure, dispute its accuracy as to matters of
this sort He referred to tne Mew York Counei
and Enquirei, as containing abundant evidence
that stocks and produce, of almost every descii) -
t>on, had lately very much advanced in price
Tne.e was no evidence of the fact that a dollar
would command much rnoienow tl an it did six
months ago Tor his \ art, he (Mr V ) had had
but soiry evidence or experience of this alleged
diminution of pi,ces On his way to this city,
last fall, he gave five dolls rs for a 1 at, now he had
had the goou luck to piy six dolíais for the same
kind of article Let tne gentleman go to his tailor
and see whether Ins prices aie reduced In the
little intercourse which ne (Mr V ) had lately had
with the craft, he hud not found that they were
more merciful now than forneily If he might
be permuted to use an express on wmeh the news-
papers had often represented him as beirg very
partial to, he would say that this cty about the
leduction of prices in the alucies of living was all
v< a kumlig "
His co league had drawn a poition of his aigu-
mentfiom New York Two thousand dollars, he
«aid, was the salary of a judge m that State, and
that, he said, was enough in all conscience, but
the gentleman had remembered to foiget to state
how much the judges leceived under the old con-
stitution, in the days of our ICents, our Thomp-
sons, and our Spencers Judicial salaries were
then sometimes as high n New York as $4,500,
but a reform took place, and the old judges were
removed by the new constitution. Eight circuit
judges were appointed, with salaries of only $1,250
a year The chancellor and judges of the supreme
court received but ^2 000 Reputable and compe-
tent men, to be sure, took these offices, but it was
with the expectation, at that time generally enter-
tained, that the Legislature of New York would
soon irerease this vet y inadequate, he would
almost say petit laiceny, compensation The Sen-
ate, yeai atter yeai, with a promptness that did
tiem honor, had passed a bi'l to increase these
judicial salaries, but it always failed in the lower
House, and sometimes gentlemen had been mag-
nanimous enough to vote against it on thegiound
that one of the judges of the tupíeme court, and
one of the cncuit judges had been members of the
convention, and had advocated the clause in the
constitution of that State, restricting the compen-
sation of members of the Legislature to three dol-
lars per day' His colleague, (with whom Mr
V was proud to say he had seived in the Legi¡>-
latuieof ins native State,) and the party to which
his honorable colleague belonged, lad uniformly
opposed the increase of judicial salaries, and gen-
erally based their opposition upo i the broadgtound
of principle, which was found 11 the unfortunate
speeches of the aforesaid judges Mr V did not
mean to question the disinteiestedness or patiwtisn
of such opposition The lesult of this policy had
been injurious to the interests of thatgieat State,
which he had the honor in part to repiesent Its
chancellor had been duven by it from the capital,
where he ought to reside, into thecountiy, where
he is now to be sought foi by those who had
business with him, at great expense and loss of
tine
Beassured.Mi Chairman, that our judicial sali-
nes now aie not the boastof New York As evi-
dence that these sUaries were generally regarded
as inadequate by most of the reflect ng men of that
State, he need only mention the fact, that within
the last six years, a couit of common pleas had
been created" by law for the city of New York,
with three judges, who, with the perquisites allow-
ed them, received over $3,000 a year. It was in
no spirit of pride that he mentioned this gross
inconsis'ency
But the eth cs of his colleague appeared to him
(Mr V ) at least dubious     He says that some
salaries aie not too high, but that others are, that
we shall never secuie the necessary information as
to those tnat aie too huge, till we make one sweep-
ing and indiscriminate reduction, that then, and
not 111 then, the secret will be let out    Sir, is thu
just—is it moral'   It is proposed to do injustice
to the meritorious, i*> order to ferret out those who
receive too much     This, sir, is like pur ishing the
mi ocent in Older to detect the guilty, and com-
poits well with t'-e prme pies and policy of those
gentlemen who wo ild refuse to give a reasonable
compensation to other officers of the Government,
merely because the Constitution had prohibited
them fiom increasing their own pay    It stiikes
¡ me, indeed, sir, that the argument drawn from
| New York is an unimportant one for the gentle-
| man, and that the one based upon the alleged
reduction of prices m the expenses of living is
I equally unavailable, because it is not supported ty
' fact
|     Mr FILLMORE spokem reply to his colleague,
I   [Mr Vandeepoel,] and in support of the propo-
sifon to reduce salaries
i     Mr POLKroseto implore the House to proceed
II  with the bill This was the annual appropriation
bi 1, one which was seldom delayed, even intimes
I of high party excitement, by a general d'scussion.
This was the fourth day on which this bill had
JI been discussed, and we had got no further than
I the fourth clause of it, when v/e were met by a
I proposition to reduce all salaries from the sums
fixed by law
|| Mr CHILTON ALLAN spokem reference to
the revenue of the coun'ry, which, he said, would
suffer from the failure of the banks in which the
public money was deposited. The Government
(he said) had Jost §100,000 by the failures of four
banks within sight of the Capitol
Mr POLK here interrupted the gentleman from
Kentucky, by asking him what authority he had
for his assertion Would the gentleman permit
the membei from Maine to introduce the resolu-
tion which he proposed this morning, for an
inquiry into the causes of the failure of these
District banks' and whether they stopped pay-
ment involuntarily or purposely, and from contri-
vance                                                                  V
Mr C. ALLAN said the question was an ex-
traordinary one When our money was scattered
about in irresponsibleState banks, what means had
we of ascertaining how much of our money was
lost' He had spoken from mere rumor But he
would say that the public money was in unsafe
hands, and he here pledged himself, in the face of
the House and the nation, to prove that the banks
selected as the depositories of the Government
could not now honor the draft of the Government
for the amount of money held by them. He chal-
lenged gentlemen to give him a committee and let
him try the fact, instead of taunting him with a
petty question as to what motives a bank had in
stopping payment
Mr POLK said, if he understood the gentle-
man rightly, he had at first made his assertion in
an unqualified manner He had asked the gen-
tleman for his authority, because he did not wish
to permit the assertion to go out to the publicas a
fact It now appealed that the gentleman's state-
ment was founded on conjectures about as solid aa
the statements made elsewhere on the same sub-
ject. Not one of the banks selected by the Secre-
tary of the Treasury had failed Some banks in
this District had failed voluntarily, purposely, and
with the view of operating here and elsewhere.
Theie was a small deposite in the Bank of Alex-
andria, not one dollar of which will be lost, as it
was well secured But the Bank of Alexandria
was not a deposite bank selected_by the Secretary
of the Tieasuiy Since the year 1787 there had
been a small deposite left there
