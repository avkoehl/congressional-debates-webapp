der adopting Jefferson's Manual as a part of them ,
and it w as upon the gentleman's motion, also, that
the pntítmg of the large edition of that work took
place. It was, however, with no view of attach-
ing blame to any one that he sought for informa-
tion on this pomt It was to prevent the recur-
rence of so large an expenditure in future The
matter had presented itself to his mind, and he
thought it not an improper subject for the attention
of the proposed select committee, but within the
range of the original resolution
In what he had proposed, Mr D said he had no
design of precluding the movei of the resolution
from going into the most full and ample investiga-
tion into all other subjects he chose His colleague
[Mr Hor-Kiss] proposed, Mr D believed, to pro-
vide by law for preventing the employment of any
conductor of a political journal to execute the pub-
lic printing Whether he should ult mately concur
with his colleague m that object, he could not then
say He should hear the reasons for it, and be
governed accordingly It must take strong rea-
sons, however, to induce him to vote for any law
proscribing any individual or class of individuals,
from carrying on their work If it was wrong to
elect the conductor of a political journal to do the
public printing, the House could apply the correc-
tive at the time of the election They might refuse
to vote for him on that ground, but he was not dis-
posed to pass a proscripüve law
Mr D said he did not blame the zeal of his col-
league, [Mr Hopkins,] who moved the original re-
solution, for desiring to withhold all the Govern-
ment patronage from political journals, but it would
be recollected that a short lime before a colleague
of thens [Mr Patton] vacated his seat, he had pro-
posed, under the direction of the Library Commit-
tee, that theie should be a very large subscnption
to a political journal,(Niles's Register,) which would
amount, according to the best calculation*, to up-
wards oí §12,000 per annum Mr D was oppos-
ed to the adoption of that resolution, and voted to
lay it on the table, and it was but a reasonable
conclusion that all who voted as he did weie also
opposed to that pioposition, and that all who voted
against the motion to lay it on the table were in
its favor If Mr D was not mistaken, tus col
league [Mi Hopkins] voted ogamit laying it on
the table Now this was a proposition that was a
direct proffer of Government pntionage toa politi-
cal journal, and, moreover, looked pretty much
like a squinting of censorship over that political
journal, for the Clerk of the Hou-e was directed
by it to supervise the work, make indices, &c Mr
D did not mention this circumstance, with a view
to show that there was any inconsistent on the
part of his colleague, but to show that those who
claimed of the bweful influence of Government
patronage over the press sometimes gave votes
which looked verj much like it He knew it to be
very common for gentlemen to talk about the cor-
ruption of the press by the patronage of the Go-
vernment, and he knew it to be, also, very ommom
to talk about the venality of editors, and of a sub-
sidised press JNTow all this may be very true, but
if it was, it was equally applicable to all political
pames How far the election ol printer for that
House may have that inlluence he could not tell,
and whether it produced that effect or not he would
not undertake to say, but the rumors and charges
of this conupting influence were ^onsiantly reite-
rated But was it confined to one paity alone?
Why he had seen a charge going the rounds of the
public press that an effort was making to buy a
public press, to be published m this city, and a cir-
cular was said to have been distributed over the
signatures of some members of the House, solicit-
ing contributions and support for it This was one
of the charge*- in currenc), but he professed to
know nothing either of if truth, or propriety, if true
Such charges, however, would always be reiterated
by every political party against e?ch other
He would briefly advert to one remark made by
his colleague [Mr Wise] yesterday, in reference
to another snbject His colleague had referred to
Mr D as one of those belonging to what was de
nominated the Divorce party, that party which was
in favor of the Independent Treasury bill Now
he did not complain of this allusion of his col-
league, but he was at some loss to perceive the con-
nection between that question and the one now be-
fore the House Mr D how ev er, had no objec-
tion of avowing, at this or anv other time, his opi-
nions on that subject He was one of those who
wished to organize the Treasury of the United
States upon its constitutional ground, and to dis-
connect it entirely and wholly from its union w llh
State institutions He believed good policy re-
quired it, and he believed it to be according to the
spirit and intent of the framers of the Constitution
that it should be so He believed it to be accord-
ing io the settled purpose and design of the institu-
tions of Virginia that ihe business and operations
of each Government, State and Federal^ should
be kept separate and distinct, and that that
great State rights principle was violated by their
connection So jealous was Virginia on that sub
ject, that she had expressly provided m her Consti-
tution that no officer of her's should hold any ap-
pointment under the Federal Government, such
was her jealousy of any union of the two Govern-
ment , and her determina ion to keep them separate
and distinct Mr D unhesitatingly avowed that
he was one of those who went for an entire separa-
tion between ihe revenues of the Federal Govern-
ment and the State banks When that im-
portant subject came up, Mr D hoped to have
an oppoitumly oí giving his views upon it
more at length, and he flattcied himself that he
could give satisfactory reasons to his constituents
for the course he should take At present he
would say no more, for it was not pertinent to the
subject under consideration , but thus much, he felt
called upon to say, from the allusion made to him
by his colleague He concluded by expressing a
hope that the amendment he had submitted would
be adopted by the House
Mr GARLAND of Virginia then obtained the
door, butgase wav to tne

issue oí Treisury noi.es, tin bill, at present, being

IN & EN ATE,
Thursday, April 19, 1838
A message was received from the President of
the United States, by Mr A Van Buren, his pri-
vate secretary, transmitting certain surveys and ex-
aminations relative to light-houses, called for by the
íesolution of the Senate of the 8th instant—and,
On motion of Mr D WIS it was laid on the
table
The CH1IR announced a communication from
the Secretary of the Treasury, transmitting, m com-
pliance with the resolution of the Senate of the 16th
instant, copies oí three statements madt by the
Pennsylvania Bank of the United States, at the
oommencemeHt of the months of February, March,
and April of this year, which, on motion, of Mr.
GRUNDY, was laid on the table
Mr SOUTHARD presented the proceedings of
the citizens of Rahway county, New Jersey, on the
subject of the Independent Treasury bill laid on
the table
Mi S also piesented «-eveial petitions, one
from Philadelphia, and the others from New
Jer ev, praying a reconsideration of the Che-
lokee treaty laid on the table and ordered to be
printed
Mr WRIGHT piesented the memorial of John
H Wheeler supenntendant of the Branch Mint at
Charlotte, North Carolina, requesting increase of
compensation for the officers of that institution re-
ferred to the Committee on Finance
The joint resolution fixing the day for the ad-
journment of Congress was taken up
Mr GRUNDY thought it would be better to
postpone the passage of this resolution until a
moie convenient season There was no period m
the histoiv of the Government when more import-
ant business was be'ore the national legislature
than at piesent and not to perfect at least a greater
portion of it, might be looked on as remissness on
our part If tne íesolution were to pass the Senate
t would then be unaer the control of the other
House He thought it would be better not to de-
cide at this early day When the bulk of the busi-
i ess was finished then u would not only be proper,
but m some measure oui duty to do so He would
therefore move to postpone the subject, say until
Monday week, at which time he thought the Senate
would be better prepared to act He was awa e
(as «ai judie oa-dy observed the other day by the
Senator w ho introduced the resolution) that n hen a
day w as fixed both benches of the legislature vv ere
usually moie expeditious, and that it did, in some
measure, stimulate them to extra exertion, and
after the period specified by him m his motion had
elapsed he would have no objection to take up the
resolution and act definitely on it He was as
anxious as any man to get away, from private rea-
sons, but he was willing to make all matters yield
to the paramount duties of a public station
