The resolution being before the House,
Mr CUSHING submitted the following amend-
ment, which Mi  Pry accepted as a modification
And whether any officer of the United States instigated
or participated m certain late riotous proceedings in the
State of Pennsylvania, as alleged in the proclamation of the
Governor of said State, and what measures, if any, the
President has taken to investigate and punish «aid acts,
and whether such officers still remain in the service of the
United States
Mr BIDDLE said he did not rise to combat
this resolution, yet it was to be legretted that, at
a time when excitement appeared to be subsiding
elsewhere, an attempt should be made to revive
it here Misht it not seem abroad to spring from
a wish to inflame and exasperate, rather than
from a grave and sinceie pursuit of information >
Why this parade about buefchot, &c ? Did it not
betraya feeling which luiked,sayunconsciously,
beneath a fair outside ' He would not be drawn
into a discussion of the pietext which had led to
violence and outrage, although piepared to do so
It was a cunning device, by long aitides which
few would take the tioublc to mastei, to distiact
attention from the point which must cause all
thoughtful men to regaid these tiansactions with
astonishment and shame When the mutineers,
in 1783, placed men with fixed bayonets at the
doois of Congi(ss,nnd compelled an adjournment
to Piinceton,no one {.topped to inquire what their
pietended "gnevances" weie There was a
burst of indignation over the whole country, and
General Washington instantly dispatched a mill
taiyfoiceto the scene of violence He would no
moie pause to examine these [pretexts thin if the
wme mob had rushed into the court house and
diiven out judge and juiy, on the pietended ap
piehension of an unjust verdict Ño one would
think it necessary to entei into the details of the
case before expiessmg hit, deep and honest indig-
nation at what must bieak up all government and
all secuuty for life and pioperty He íepeated
his íegiet that his honorable colleague had thought
it expedient thus, like the son ol Noah, to lay
bale to the derisive gaze of the woild that over
which a pious tenderness would rather have
thrown a mantle
Mi   PETR1KIN said he should have silently
voted foi  this, resolution, if (he Demociacy of
Pennsylvania (who weie piaembly iesi«ting the
usmpations which the B>nk Why Abolitionists
of that State were now attempting to poipetnte)
had not been stigmatized by his colleague [Mi
Biddll] as a mob     Ho would not be doing his
duty if he weie silently to suffei the independent
ficemen of his native ¡state to be thus slandeied
He now íeptlled the gross chai ge with thatmdig
nation which it meuts   He said he had been hab
ituated to see in the Bank Whig Abolition news
papéis, and toheai hom their partisans, the whole
vocibulary  of billingsgate  lansacked  and   ex
hausted, to find opprobrious epithets to apply to
a people who daied to assert their rights against
the domineering bank austocracy    They have
been pleased to style them mobs, swinish multi-
tude, jacobins, disorgamzers, destructives, dirty-
shuts, locofocos, and eveiy othei name which
this self styled " decency paity,"m then fruitful
imaginations, could invent to lender the Democ
lacy of Pennsylvania odious at homeandabioad
taking eaie always to combine, as in the present
instance, those epithets with a false statement of
ficts    He said he had just returned from Harris
bins, and saw no mob there, unless the militaiy
biought fi >m Philadelphia, in direct violation of
the (onstitution and Uws of the State, by Gov
ernor Ritnei and his Bank Whig Antimasonic
Abolition advisers, to shoot down the unarmed
citi/ens of Pennsylvania, be that moo    He saw
that mob, aimed, and furnished with cartridges
and ball and buckshot, to shoot down, he would
leiteiate, the unarmed citizens of his State, who
weie  peaceably and  constitutionally  asseitmg
their rights, and at the same time declaring their
intention to supjaort the Constitution and laws in
their puuty, and to pievent the usurpan n of all
the powers of the government by a band of un-
principled demagogues, who were attempting to
set aside the will of the majority, fairly and clearly
expressed, as they had previously attempted to
corrupt and destroy the elective franchise at the
recent geneial election
Mr P said he saw at Harnsburg what is an
anomaly in the United States, and he believed also
in the despotic Governments of European modem
days at least, the military furnished with cai>-
ndges, consisting of ball and three buckshot, to
fire upon an unaimed people He had brought
one with him fholdmg it up to view] to exhibit
to citizens of all parts of the Union, and let them
anticipate what the people aie to expect from the
tender meicies of the Bank-Whig Antimasons
and Abolitionists, if unfortunately their party
should get the Government into then hands Yes,
sir, (said he,) this is an earnest of what the peo-
ple may expect if ever the country should be
cursed by an Administration amalgamated of such
materials We will then see the aimed soldiery
throughout the Union, as they now are in Penn-
sylvania, furnished with the same kinds of muni-
tions, to shoot down the people if they assemble
peaceably to asseit their rights It was, in the
estimation of this same Bank-Whig paity, \nck~
edly cruel, to use buckshot cartridges duimg the
war of 1812 against the enemies of our countiy,
but it now is peifectly humane and right to use
them against our own citizens
Sir, (said Mr P ,) we hear complaints made
thai the United States officers are at Harnsburg,
participating in what the gentleman and his pai-
tisans call a mob I saw more than one person
there who aie officers under the United States
Government, and who were biought there, not
of their own volition, but by Governor Ritner and.
his partisans—dragged fiom their homes, their
family, and their business, by his unlawful and
arbitrary mandate, to shoot down their peaceable
and unarmed fellow-citizens The gentleman, in
his haste to join in the cry against the officers of
the United States Government, forgets to tell us
that an officei of that Government, one of the
" decency parly," like himself, has furnished Gov-
ernor Ritner and his people with fixed ammuni-
tion to slaughter the peaceable citizens of Penn-
sylvania This pait of the story he wishes kept
behind the curtain, and he will, no doubt, applaud
this violation of duty by that officer, but if a cit-
izen officer under the United States Government
happen to say that the people ought to mle, and
are right, then he and his paity join in the hue
and cry, not only against the individual, but the
Government also
If people, peaceably assembled to pievent the
usuipation of then rights and the subveision of
the Constitution and their libefties by abandoned
and unprincipled men, be a mob in the estima-
tion of my colleague and of his party, then (said
Mr P ) I gloiy in being a Democnt and one
of the people, whethei they be called a mob,
swinish multitude, Jacobin, Locofoeo, or by
whatevei name they may be styled They v. ho
aie now arming themselves in Pennsylvania ire
icady to assert then lights against all encioach-
ments, from whatevei quarter they may be at-
tacked, whethei by foreign invaders oi domestic
tiaitors As to the íesolution befoie the House,
he thought it ought to pass, that the Representa-
tives of the people, and the people themselves,
should know by what authority the aims and
ammunition of the United States had been fur-
nished to use against the peaceable citizens of his
State He had no doubt, howevei, that the gen-
tleman [Mr BiddLe] and his paity would much
rather not let this outiage upon their brethren m
Pennsylvania come befoie the public in an official
and authentic way that cannot be denied
Mi NATi LOR said that he would vote for the
íesolutionas it had been modified, but that,at the
same time, he must expiess the heaity íegiet
which he felt that this subject had been brought
befoie the House in the foim m winch it now
stood He congiatulated the countiy, however,
if indeed it was a cause of congratulation, that
the members of the Administration paity weie
themselves beginning to move for inquiries He
knew what the object of the inquiry was so soon
as the motion was submitted this morning He
knew that its object was political effect and polit-
ical excitement It was to furms-h naragraphs to
the Globe, and to sustain the officeisof the Gov-
ernment of the United States in their efforts to
usuip, through the medium of a mob, the gov-
ernment of the State of Pennsylvania.
