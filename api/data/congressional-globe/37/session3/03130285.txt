THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

of Gr«*at Bntain; and that it would be utterly im-
possible to make loans on a specie basis fast enough
to meet such enormous expenditures.
At the last session, and after (here had been a
general suspension of specie payments by the
banks and (he Government, Confess authorized
the issue of $150,000,000 of le^al tender notes;
and by another law, passed a few months later in
the Session, an additional issue of £150,000,000 was
also authoiized, but the Secretary was required
to hold in reserve ^50,000,000 to meet any calls
that might be made for^gpiporary deposits in the
sub-Treasury. We all hoped that this would be
all the legal tender notes that would be necessary.
Congress also authorized the Secretary to borrow
$500,0l)0,0uil, payable in twenty years, and le-
deenhible nt the piuisui eof the Government after
five years, bearing interest at the rate of six per
cent, per annum, payable half yearly in coin, and
gave hi in authority to sell them at any time "at
the maiket pneo" to raise money to carry on the
war; and further authorized the holder of any
legal tender notes to convert them at any time, at
par, into these six per cent, bonds.
The Secretary has paid out nearly $250,000,000
legal tender notes, being all that he was author-
ized to issue; and notwithstanding he has had au-
thority foi the last ten months to sell$500,000,000
of five-twenty six per cent, bonds, at, the maiket
price, he has only disposed of about $95,000,000,
and has still authority to sell $475,G00,000 at (he
maiket price, and take his pay for them in legal
tender notes.
One of the reasons why more of these bonds
ha\e not been disposed of is that there has been no
redundancy ofcuireney, and it ha^ been difficult
for the Secretary to legal tender notes on a
sale of the bonds and seven three-tenths notes that
he has already negotiated.
The War and Navy Departments have almost
unlimited power to contract debts for the supply
of the Army and Navy. The volume of supplies
and supply trains for your Army are enormously
large; and extending over such a widely extended
field of military operations as that in which our
several Army corps are engaged, no one can fail
to seo that it is next to impossible to estimate ac-
curately the amount to be apnropi iated for a yeai
in ad \ ance. 13ut it is painfully certain, that with
the present Army in the field, there is no way of
limiting the amount of expenditures when they
are actively operating to put down so gigantic end
desperate a rebellion.
We know that the liquidated and funded debt
is already large, aiv: that there a I ir^o accrued
indebtedness, winch ou^ht to be paid at a,i early
day, but without any adequate means in the Treas-
ury to pay it. Thei" is a large amount one to the
soldieis that must be paid , t the earhot inoim nr
possible. The soMiers ik> w on the field of ba  > le or
cncampod in front of the enemy, enduring al' the
perils and haidships of war, many of whom have
not received tluiivpay for months, ouirht not to
be put off any longer. They can hardly be ex-
pected to peiform their duties with alacrity, un-
less they are promptly paid, espr ciaily win n they
know, as many of them do, that their families at
home are stiff' ring for the want of the means of
life. It is mi impetanve u< cessity that the mean&
for paying the Ai my and Navy should not be d< -
layed an}' longer. Si' the Secretary cannot raise
the money to pay the ereditoiw of the Govern-
ment by a loan o:i five-twenty six pei cent, bonds
at the maj ket price, other authot ity must be given
him to raise ;iie money, and Congress ought to con-
fer that authority upon him as soon as possible.
The time has anivd when our finances must
engage the earnest.md united attention ofoli loyal
Representatives. We were m great pei d hist y ear,
but our dangersare now twofold what they were
then. 11 was vci y difficult last year to provide
the money to meet the lar^e appropi unions made
for the snppoit of the Army and Navy. It will
be still more difficult to meet the enlaiged require-
ments of the current and t he next fiscal year. The
Army bill alone appropriates over $731,000,000,
which added to the estimates of all the other ex-
penditures for the fiscal year ending June 30, 13G4,
amount to the cnoi mous sum of^1 ,005,431,183 56,
to which must be added the amount sill! required
for appropi Ml ions a nd deficiency of the year ending
June 30, 16G3, and whieh, according to the report
of the Secretary of the Treasury, amounted on the
1st of December last to the sum of §551,221,131 59,
making the whole aggregate required to meet
appropriations during the next eighteen months
$1,046,034,315 15.
The following statement will exhibit with sonic
degiecof accuracy the amount of the expenditures
and the probable resources for the current and
next fiscal year, and the probable amount of ap-
propriations that will ?iot be drawn at the close of
the year:

of this large sum, and has applied it

The Secretary anticipates that be can hortow
during the enrrent yeor, under ox-isi ing Uiws, thif
following sums, n.imelv: tSie amount received on
deposit a: the different sub-Trensaries nt four
and five percent., at the date of his report, was
$79,70S,U50; and he estimates that he may receive
on deposit (borrow in this form) during the c,jr.
rent year the additional sum of #20,201,350
Certificates of indebtedness at one year, bearing
interest at six per eent., h;ne already In en issued
to the amount of ^H7,'3G3,2U U5 ; and the Secre-
tary estimates that he cum enrrv a debt m tins
form of at least *>100,000,1)00, and that he may be
' able to issue additional certificates to the amount
of.   S12,63G#7S8 35
The Secretary had only borrowed, at the date
of his report, under the act authorizing the issue
of $500,000,000 five-twenty six per cent, bonds,
the sum of $23,750,000; and estimates that, if the
law remains as it is, he can borrow during the
current year the additional sum of....$35,000,000
These last three items not being yet realized,
and depending upon the contingency of borrow-
ing, cannot be now counted as positive resources.
In addition to the above estimates for the cur-
rent year, the Secretary has sent us estimates for
the year ending June 30, 1864. It is customary
for Congress to make appropriations one year in
advance, and also provide the means to meet such
additional appropriations.
The aggregate of appropi Iations made nr aMccd for l>y the
Seciotary during tho liscal year ending June 3.), 1854,
amount to the turn of. $1,095,413,183 56
From which deduct the piolaldo amount
of appropriations uluch irifl remain
undrawn July 1, 1S14, estimated by the
Secietaiy at $-250,000,000, but which,
witft the laigc and piessmg demands
that will he made upon him, are not
likely to exceed    100,000,000 00
Probable amount of expenditure dur-
ing the fihtial year ending June 30,
1864   995,413,183 56
The Secretary estimates re-
sources during the fiscal year, end-
ing June 30, 1864, as follows:
Receipts from ciiftom dunes, $70,000,000
Receipts fioui internal rev-
enue    150,000,000
Receipts from the sale of
lands   25,000

Whole amount (over and above tevemies)
to be provided loi at thi^hession to cany
on the Government to July 1, 1864....$1,117,139,409 57
This estimate exceeds that of the Secretary of
theTreasury by more than $200,000,000. Ileasks
for only ^900,000,000; but J estimate that, if the
creditors are paid up promptly, not leaving more
than $100,000,000 uf undrawn appropriations at
the end of the next fiscal year, not less than
,117,000,000 will be required, over and above
taxes and custom;--, to cairy on the Government to
the 1st of July, 1864, provided the war is prose-
cuted on the same scale that it is now carried on
up to that time.
