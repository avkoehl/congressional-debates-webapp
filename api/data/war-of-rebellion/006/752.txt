of Captain Hollins at the blockading fleet must have infused new life and spirit into our people.

The Government is fast provident, to the extent of its ability, shoes and clothing for our troops, and is greatly relieved in this herculean task by the patriotic and generous aid of just such governors of States as our own Tom Moore.

I am sure you will be persuaded that nothing I can do shall be left undone for the defense of Louisiana, while you would not wish, I am equally sure, that I should neglect the defenses of other points of importance in order to concentrate all our resources in New Orleans alone.

Yours, very truly,

J. P. BENJAMIN.
