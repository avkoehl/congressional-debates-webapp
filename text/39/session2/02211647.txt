THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

something remains to be done in respect to
the security of the United States in this mat-
ter. I am satisfied that we are the indorsers
of these bonds, because the investments were
to be made in safe and good stocks, and were
actually made in unsafe and bad stocks, either
in part or in whole.
The committee recommend non-concurrence
in order to see if some provision may not be
made by which the United States will assume
the debt and turn over these bonds to law offi-
cers of the Government to ascertain whether
they are worth anything or not.
