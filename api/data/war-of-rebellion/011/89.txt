CAMP NEAR COLUMBIA, April 3, 1862.

Major-General HALLECK:

Dispatch of yesterday received. The troops at Camp Chase are only fragments, and scarcely more than enough to guard prisoners. I am taking along the division which I designed to have provisionally in front of Columbia. I am not altogether satisfied to do it, have diminished the force near Nashville to remedy it.
