WAR DEPARTMENT, C. S. A., Richmond, May 5, 1863.

General W. H. F. LEE, Gordonsville, Va.:

Detachments of enemy's cavalry, varying, according to reports from 500 to 2,000 men in a body, have been for the last two days making raids in Goochland, along the river and three chopped roads [sic], and in Hanover and Henrico, along the lines of the Richmond and Fredericksburg and Central Railroads, cutting wires, tearing up tracks, burning bridges, except those on the Annas guarded by us, menacing Richmond apparently with attack, from the distance of 3 or 4 miles, but really I think, intending to cover escape of all down the Peninsula. I believe Richmond and the bridges on the Annas fully guarded, but from want of cavalry we cannot pursue and punish.

J. A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War.

General W. H. F. LEE, Gordonsville, Va.:

The general detachments of the Yankee cavalry that have been prowling in Goochland and around this city, with the exception of about 500 who escaped down the Peninsula, are, from concurring reports, believed to have returned toward Louisa Court-House,or somewhere thereabouts, perhaps retreating toward the Rapidan.
