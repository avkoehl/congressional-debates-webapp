wbich must necessarily terminate in the violation
of the com promise act, and reopen the tariff con
troversy? Are ihey willing lo surrender ti e im-
portant branch oí revenue from the public lands,
which must yield annually, if faithfully adminis-
tered, four or five millions of dollars, when they
are lo receive, in its distribution, one dollar, for
which their condiments would have to pay at least
five times as much, to make good the deficit?
He would also appeal to Senatois from the
North, and ask, would thev now set aside the com-
promise? The South has faithfully and honorably
adhered to it, while it was favorable to ihe Norib
will the North, now, when the South in turn is
about to reap the advantage, forget the fidel'ty with
which we adhered to it, and deprive us of the be-
nefit to which we are so justly entitled? He could
not believe it possible that a course so disreputable
would be adopted by the Northern Senators, un-
less indeed, some portion of the Southern Senators
should, by theif votes, set the example, by sacn
ficing the interests ot their constituents
Mr CLAY of Kentucky said the conjectural es
tímate of twenty-seven millions as the annual ex-
penditure of the Government was a mere supposi-
tion, deduced from the average expenditure of the.
four years of Mr Van Burén'  administration He
hoped no Whig would ever assume that average as the
average annual expenditure of a Whig Administra-
tion. He would gj for reducing it to the lowest
year in expenditure oí that Admin stration, which
was twenty-two millions, and he even thought it
might be reduced lo twenty He was prepaied to
show at the proper time, that, without any violi-
tion of the compromise act, which he desired to
preserve inviolate as. much as any man en that
floor, the bill from the House, row on ojr tibie,
would yield a revenue to the amount of twenty-
eight or twenty-nme millions, and tbi3 by the
slight increase of duties, and Ul'ing ihe home
valuation, which was done by adding twei ty ptr
cent to the foreign valuation The compromise
bill was passed with the understanding that the
revenues of the Government were to be derived
fiom the customs alone
Mr CALHOUN -aid not only the Senate but
the country had a right to complain oí the order
which the Senator had given to the business of the
session, for he held him exclusively responsible
He has reversed the natural order throughout the
entire session putting that first which ought to
succeed the other, and rendering it almost impossi-
ble to diiciss int lltgibly any one bill fi<m lie
wantol a full knowledge of that vhuh ought to
precede it This case furnishe* a ¡striking illustra-
tion It is manifest <tt every step that the b 11 m
po mg taxes ought to have been di^ «sscd before
Ihi* bill lor the di t lbution of the revenue from
the lands How can any one a certain whether
the revenue from the lands ian be spared, till it is
known what revenu  tne tax bill will give? And
yet we are forced into the discuv>i n of the la er
without the sligh est reason bet re we have con-
sidered Ihe former. The Seiiattr ought to have
commenced the session, if he intended fair y, wi h
the tax bill, and settled, in the first in>tanee, what
was to be ihe pol cy of the Adrmm trat on, wnat
sum it would require annua ly to carry into effect
that policy, and how it «as to be raised By
adopting that oiucr, earn pri-vding subject would
have casi light on that ih ch followed and the
business of the se s on pn jres«ed at least intelli-
gibly, if not ui ely It his des gn was to carry
his measures ai all events, whether ri^ht or wrong,
the course pursued may have been the prt per one,
but if not—it h° r )i d on the wisdom and truth
oí the mea tires ¿s the means cf carrying them,
the order adopted v ->s cer am'y mou pieoosterous
This brousnt him to the exti^ordmary •"ssertion
of ihe S- Mtor, ih.it the compromise ot was passed
with an urderstaa 'ing that alter 1842 th.- revei ue
from the pub'io lancis was to be di tnbu el am<ng
the States HJ (Air C ) knew not what was the
understan lirg between <>i Vrs but as lo 'w ^elf it
was utteily without foundation. Ht had never
heard of it until v i bin the It t ícw r'iys, when he
noticed it in the columns of t1 e In tell fencer He
repeated, there was no 'uch understanding As
far as be was concerned, it was a pure fiction, and
CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
neither he nor his constituents were or could be
bound by it The Senairr musí know that, as to
him(j3r Calhoun) it wasnn¡os ble there could
be such an understanding He knows that I have
been steadily anddetermtB«dly opposed to the mea-
suie. That Í have regarded it as the mo«t palpa-
bly unconstitu lonal, tae mo*t danaerous and mis
clnevous measure ever proposed in Congress
Nor can he be ignorant that I voted steadily on all
question-*, direct and incidental, agaian the bill
during that session.
But the Senator himself, by his own course, bas
furn shed the strongest evidence that there was] no
such understanding as he now averts His distri-
bution bill has been before the body nearly ever)
year snee, he has had the gre i'e*t anxiety to pa^s
it and vet ha never, in a single instance, mtirrated
any such understandirg.
But to return to the tax bill The Senator says
that he is prepared to show that by the aid of
home valuation twenfj-eight or twent;-nine mil
lions may be aenved fiom the customs without
nominally increasing the duties above twenty per
cent To make this out, he assumes that home
valuation would add twenty percent to the invoice
prices Does he forget that the laws as they ori-
ginally stood, add ten per cent lo the value of all
goods coming from this side of the Cape of fiood
Hope, and twenty per cen upon all beyond?
which ¡t row retains in effect, and of course that
instead of making his estima'e upon twenty per
cent round, it ought to be but ten per cent upon
goods imported from this side of the Cape of Good
Hope, and nothing upon those beyond.
But he would ask the Senator, on what principle
has he assumed twenty per cent on the invoice a^ th¿
home valuation? Has he entered into any elato
i ate calculation to show that it is the real diffei ence
between the foreign and the home price? and if not,
has he assumed it arbitrar ly without any data If
so, what prevents it from being raised totiurtj,,
forty, fifty, or one hundred per cent and the rr-
ii troduc ion of an opprcs ive protective tariff sys-
tem under this new fiction1 It would certainly be
a very cunning and ingenious mode of sating
asidr the compromise act.
B it the Senator objects to th" amount estimated
as the annual expenditure by the chairman of the
Committee of Ways and M.ans in the other
House He regards it as a mere assumption, and
altogether too b.gh I, said Mr Cal'uun, have
the speech of the m-raliT before me, an i do not
rtgatd it in the 1 ght th-it the Senatoi does It is
the estra ted an^ not the as-turned amount, and I
mppjre th-tt the authority of ihe chairman of the
Wpys and M ans in the o her House on a finan-
cial point ought to be regardel as high a-s the
Senator's, or any other, exepp', peihpps, toe Secre-
tary of the Tieasury. If I m aht be permitted to
docde b^we^n Ihei i, and to judj,e of th-- future by
the piesent, by the expendí ure of the present <e -
sun, my op m«n would be that tb° entina s of the
chairman ot ihe Ways and Means was too low
rathpr than too h gh
We are, however, told that emenditures are to
be reduced, aid economy and retrenchment to be-
come the order of the day He woald much
rather see it than hear of it He has become
ilow of belief and dis rusiful of piomi e  from
tho^e m power Wh never he hears the-n from
that quarter he involuntarily thirks with what
fidelity ihey have observed the famous promise
tt at proscription ¡.nould be pro cubed. Before he
sai down he would again warn Southern gentle-
men tha n thejr vote against this amendment and
in fpvor of the bill, they would lay the certain
foundation of a violation of the comprom se, and
the renewal of all the oppression of a protective
tan ft
Mr CLAY said be was willing to take the re
sponsib'lity of he measures of the present session,
it they are passe I into law*, and passed ihev will
be, if there s Ideltty to lie Whig came The
Senator -¡a^s that home va'uation is uncons itu-
tional, and that he i. opposed to n, but does he
suppose that he friend-. of protection would >ield
this and give up all'o the otlersidc if he does,
 ie wi'l find himself mistaken. But it is unconsti-
tutional, says the Senator.    It is easy to make
these flippant assertions of unconstitutionality, but
it is not all urconst tutional But on another
point, which is di puted by the Senator, that after
1842 the revenues oí the Gove nmen' weie to be
aenved fiom impos's alone, he would call the at-
tention of the Senate to the law, which the Sena-
tor from South Carolina, it seemed to him, threw
down like a hot potatoe when he had examined it.
This is th  languague
"All duties upon imports shall be collected in
ready money, and a'l credits now a'lowed by law
in th  payment of duties, ^hallbe, and are hereby,
abolí.hed, and sveh duties shall be laid for the pur-
pose of raising such revenue as may be necessary to an
economical administration of Ike Governmint "
Mr Clay laiJ preit stress upon th  pa sige
merbed in italics, and insisted that it was a posi
live stipulation to resign tbe lands as revenue, and
raise it all from customs He did not care a fig
what was th  understanding, there was the law,
and he held them to the bond
Mr. CALHOUN said it was reilly surprising
that the Senator would put the tons ruction which
he his on the portion of the compromise act to
which he referred. There was nothing in the
wording of the act to justify it, nor was it possible
to believe, it it was intended by the compromise to
surrender the public lands, that it would have been
covered up in such vague and indefinite expressions.
He must say that the construction which the Sena-
tor hcscndeavired to give the act, wmld better be-
c mea pettifoging lawjerm a ten dollarcase,before
aju«tice of the peace, than a gra/e and dignified
Sena or on so important an occasion
As to home valuation, theSera'or places a veiy
different con'-tructiou on it now from what we nn-
d rstood at the time. He understood it then to be
an estima'e oí the value of the goods &t the port
where ihey were entered, and in that sensp, he re-
garded it as palpab y uncons nu íanal, and so de-
clar d it at the time, giving notice, at the same
time, that if he 'hould be a member of the body at
the time it came to be acted on, he should feel
bound to resist it with all his power He said
unconstitutional, a? it is obvious the estimated va-
lue must be different indifferent pons, higher, for
in tance, in New Orleans than in New York, and
that the same article would pay different du íes
in different port , directly contrary to the Con-
stitution He presumed, fiom the course of the
Senator, that such now is his opinion, and that he
has abinr'oned  his scheme of estimating the price
0  goons at the ports of entry His present «cheme,
althougn it may avoid the constitutional d fficu!ty,is
su! jeet, in adlition to what he-h-ssaid, to ¿aether
and a ser ous one It would subjprt heavy goods
of a small value to a greatly mcreastd duiy,'co n.
pared with light goods of a high value, as it is ob-
vious.
There w?s another objection to home valuation,
thus understood it would subject bulky goods of
small va ue to much higher duty, compara-
tively, than light goods of small vaiue, as the
fieights and charges would be much higher on
the firmer thin on the latter That is, it would
increase th* duties on articles for the most part
tonsuned by the midJling and poorer classes,
while ii would d mimsh them en those consumed
by the mor" wealthy.
Mr KING of Alabama si'd that he would not
have risen m the debate, bat for statements made
by the Senator from Kentucky \ylx Clay] m rela-
tion to ihe understanding which h" «aid prevailed
at tne time of the compromise, that the land was
to be surrendered as a source of revenue. He
sa d that he t ok a deep interest in pie mea-
sute of compromise thiougbout its progress, and
had frequent and Iree conversation-- with the Sena-
tor from Lojisiana, (now no r ore,) who took a
very a-uve part m the compromise, and never from
him, or any oiher who participa'ed m the trans?c-
1 on, did be hear a whisper oí this surrender of the
public lands as forrmng part of the considerations
entering into it
Mr.  R'VES of Va   said he was a menaber of
the coram t ee wah which the compromise origina
ted, and neser, in the discuss ons ot that commit-
tee, or out of it, d d he hear the suggestion that the
abandonment of the public land  as a source of
