ness. Why, will there not bs as much danger
when all who m ght oppose oar authority are con-
solidated m'0 ope, as when we coull deal with them
as individuals, and take them one at a time? Can we
aet on a mass with more effect than on a single man?
Js it so easy to deal with States and 10 compel them
to fulfil their engagements' Was it found so in
the days of the Confederation' Under the Confe-
deration you ac ed on States—on States who had
made promises, and did the plan work well5 Was
it perfectly easy to raí e the respective qusttts of the
State, even under the mo§t urgent pressure of the
wants of the continental army, fighting for the
liberties of us all? No, it was found to be a con-
test of Government against Government and it was
found that Governments are not as likely to pay as
individuals, and, if thev refused, it was mvich hard-
er to coerce them Hence that form of govern-
ment was changed, and our Revolutionary fore-
fathers were so "idle, or unjust, or foolish" as to
think they gained by the exchange' and the Federal
Constitution stands a monument of their wisdom to
this day. But now, foi«ooth, we are to travel
back again to the principles of the old exp'oded
Confederation1 We are to give up the land which
is ours, and in the sale and management of which
we have to do with individuals only, and we are
to convert this vast and wide landed inheritance
into debts of psrliealar States I do not dis-tru&t
the honesty of the States, or their good intentions,
but we know that it is not always convenient to pay
to-day. Do debtors never ask indulgence as to terms
or as to time' If wc take these State bonds, are
we perfectly sure they will never become a subject
of controveisy? May xYe Stales not "-ay the pro-
gress of graduation is too slow? it keeps our people
waiting too long, give us a modified graduation
law with shorter periods of reduction, so ihat we
may get the land at nine pence the acre so much
the soonei' His peace making piopoMtion only
changes the around of controversy, it does not re-
move it Its whole openh ni 1/ pirt with all the
grounds of controversy vit know, and look i ut í r
new soiiice"; of discord at pre ent unkno'ir falull
we leave the ground wc have so Ion  trod, and with
every foot of which we ait tamihfr, to plunge
into a «ea ol troubles new and untried' I say no
And then we are ti purcha t all tins troub e at a
pnce
A few years ago the proposition of th-1 honorable
Senator was to Rive up half the public lands Was
this fair, to surrender by cessim to the use of a ftw
that which is equally the property of all? To pa-
cify the clamors of nine State , -hall we give np
one-half of 160,000,000 as its ot land? Is not such
a price rather high? And have «e a right to pay
i ? I hold we have not Ttie entirr s heme seems
to me to be one of ihe wilde*, most wasteful, mo t
visionary concept! n. tint < ver emend into ihe
brain of a statesman
Bnt the object of tiie scheme i to get rid of Fx
ecutive patronage Now, 1 im nc l an advocate oí
Executive pa ronage But, It t me aMr, what a vast
patronage will there not be exerted by giving away,
in one single act of generosity, an entire moipty of
the public domain Seldom, indeed, is one indi-
vidual so formnately pl?ced as to be able, by a mii
gle act of magnificence, to main a present ot eighty
million acres of land—a va t a 11 loyal domuoii,

oí land belonging to the whole Union isteriibl)
opposed to patronage, md he tells u«, as one of his
"demonstrad! ns " that, if we rc/u c to m\k this
f iff, nine S ales will be able to se /e aid < ii ry i ff
the whole properly in a body, agunst ihe will of
the other evente n S ate? Ihe ' demonstration,"
1 confess, does not to me appeal to be veiy lo
gicai 1 do noi believe the e States will evei be
so unjust, so rapacioi s o prnfl gite, as to at-
tempt thus to su/e Hpon the propenty of tl eir
fellow citizens But if there is such great and unmi
rent danger that the e State- will thi« seize upon
the lands, if we refu e ti cede them, can not the
honorable gentleman suppose, on the same ground
of reasoning, that the States mav tear up the bonds
if we do csde them' If he cons ders them -o ut-
terly unprincipled, so impadent, and shamekss as
to seiz-1 upon and appropriate to themselvrs lands
which belong to the whole family of confederated
States, what will there be to restrain them from va-
cating their bonds after we have surrendered the
land into their possession? One part of the gentle-
man's argument supposes the States to be all vir-
tue and good faith, the other all rapacity and vio-
lence There is great danger, imminent danger of
our losing the whole domain, and we must give it
away before the Siate:> take it by force, bnt when
these entiie land  shall be converted into the shape
of a bond, then these States are to be all purity, all
honesty, all fidelity For my part it seems to me
that if we cannot depend on these nine States for
their fulfilment of their constitutional obligation to
the Union, ve cannot depend on any voluntary en-
gagement they may now enter into
I apprehend no such danger I do not call up
on the Senate to ceie the public domain on ariy
such ground If that is to be the ground of our
proceduie, I say let the lands go I will n«t be one
to encourage the sp ílers I will never be one to
say this thing most be done and will be done On
their own heads be it I will take neither part nor
lot in the responsibility
I repeat that I have no objection whatever to
consent to pre-emption, provided the rights of all
the States can be respected That is all I ask
That was all my amendment pioposed I am «en-
sible that I have occupied too much of the time of
the Senate, but, challenged and called out as I have
been as one who had offered a propostuon so out-
rageous, to enormous, so monstious, that I shrank
irom all attempt to defend it, I could not refrain
from caymg a word in explanatu n and reply The
whole subject I know is perfectly stale Not
a word can be said upon it that has not been better
said already Yet, as my proposition was pro-
nounced an enormity, I wi hed to "how that I did
not shrink from its avowal and deforce The
enornity of which I have been guilty is a simple
art of obedien e to the inrtructtons of my State Le
gislature The plan is before th  country, and de-
m unced as it may be, and outrageous as it has
been called, it is a ulan which has received the pub
he appiobation wherever I have been My own
Slate has fia'sed a s lemn resolution giving it the
seal of her approval In offeting it here, I have
but obeyed her voire, and no denunciation, how-
ever loud and swelling, shall turn me „ side from
the course she has maiked out for rae to pursue
She understands her mtere t=, sh> judge" calmly,
she" asks nothing but her plain recorded right, and I
ask nothing more in her name
Mr BENTON said that apart of the remarks
of Ihe Senator from Kentwky [Mr Crh"tfnden]
were in reply to a poor speech made by himself
(Mr B ) some da)s before, and were of a nature
to require some "ii«wer from him He wm 11 g ve
the answer which the case required but before an
j,wering the arguments i i that Sena* r he wished
to set him right on a couple ot snail points on
whuh he had fallen mtoierror
Tne S-nator supposes said Mr B th.it I applied
the term cunning to him some days ago—that
spoke ot him as a cunning nnn, and under this
supposition, he rtpul es a term which he feels lo
be injurious The Senator is certainly right in the
repulse, it such a teim was applied to him, for
certainly there is nothing m his chiratterto war-
rf*U the applicttion But 1 do not think it was so
applied, I have no recollection ol it Certain I
am that I muer thought it, md lam not rpt to
spiak what I do rot think Cunning is a quality
wh chinad never nought of it routine to the
friiik an 1 high winded character of ihat gentle
man On thee nirary, if there vas any defict in
h>s character, ("and what human ebaracier can be
withoutrisome alloy') it tb re wis any little de-
fect in his, it «as the reverse of aiming—it
was the exceso of his am abil y — and the
obliging facility of his temper I have thought
hm not qui'e cunmna er>ou"h — not quite
'h'irp enouih to keep himself out of scrapes
wh ch others ocntnve, and ihat on the pie-
sent occasion, he has given evidence of that
amiable facility by standing father for a very ugly
child which is no son of hi The Senator appear 
as the present mover of the land distnbution bil',
a measure bad enough at all times, bin too bad for
its own author to move in at the present time,
when the Treasury w so nearly empty, and when
the p oposition to abstract the land revenue from
the annual income, and distribute it among the
States, and supply its place by new taxes, is about
equivalent to a proposition to put an end to the
Constitution, and to let Congress go on to do what
it pleases, without a guide to its steps or a restric-
tion upon Us will. I think if the Senator had been
a little more cunning, he would not have moved
that bill at this time, anxious us he might have
been to oblige a friend, I think he should have de-
murred to the time, and begged off until the Trea-
sury was full
Mistaken as the Senator was in the supposition
thit the term cunning was applied to him, he has
been equally so in the application of a term of his
own to this side of the chamber, and doubtless in
tended for me—that of old°r politicians who could
give him lessons in cunning The Senator sup
poses that politicians older than himself—giving to
the phrase a pointed application by a smiling glance
m tbi* direction—would be masters of a cunning
to which younger politicians, himself for example,
could not pretend Now granting that there may
be old politicians who are too cunning for that Se-
nator, yet I deny that there are any such on this
side of the chamber, and especially affirm Ihat I
am not It is not on this side, but on his own aide
of the chamber, that he should look for these wily
elders There are none of them here We are
all his juniors Between himself and myself
he is most respectably my senior. He was
heie long before me. I remember very well
to have read with much satisfaction—the
more, because the speaker was then on my
own side in politics—the lively speeches of the
Senator fiom Kentucky, delivered on this floor,
long before Missouri was admitted into the Union
—when I myself was a mere provincial attorney
in the Territory of Missouri The gentleman was
thereioie a politician, a distinguished one, of rank
Senatorial, when I was nothing but a provincial
a t irney ' This settles the question ot political
seniority between that Senator and myself. It
leaves him far ahead of me I believe I can also
settle it up quickly for all the members pn this side
of the chamber Immediately before me (point-
ing lo Mr. King of Alabama) sits the oldest sitting
member of ihe House—not the oldest gentleman
by any means, merely the oldest sitting member
The gentleman is not yet married, and it would be
doubly wrong to wrong him in a question of time
The united'erm, for which he has been elected
amount to twenty eight years, six of which remain
yet to be served He has been here twenty-two
year , he is the longest sitting nember He has
seen many exits anJ enfrsures upon 'he Senatorial
board , but he has not been here long enough to
have seen the fiiot appeaiance of the Senator from
Kentucky. That Senator had made his first en-
hance, and his first exit also, betote the Senator
from Alabama had taken htsJfiist seat here. He had
served out a term, and was- gone, before the oldest -\
si ting member now here, had reached this floor
[Mr Crittendfv stid I have nevci been a poli-
tician since ]
Mr BENTON continued It is not on this side,
but on h s own side of the chamber, that the gen-
deman's íemark can find its application He must
look on his own side—in his o-t/n ne ghborhood—
on his light bsnd—for a view of the nly Senator
on his floor to whom his remark can ?pp!y
Having dispo ed o¡ hese two mall nutters, Mr
B wou'd proceed|to larger on s, ard fiist would
express his regret at having so °ignally failed in
almost the only qua'i'y in public sneaking which
he aimca at, and tnat was intelligibility He did
not say per pecuity, fci- ihat was <t high quality in
speasrme* and in wn ng, and one to which he did
not pretend But miei igihihiy he did pretendió
He aimed it being intelligible—at bems understood
—at making his hearers compreh-nd his meaning,
and in his aim at this quahty, roen'orious though
humble, he greatly legre ted having s0 «ignally
fai'ed Tne Senator from Ken ucky i pstonished
at the violent denunciation of a measure which has
been so long before the country he is astonished
at the violent epithets which are lavished upon the
