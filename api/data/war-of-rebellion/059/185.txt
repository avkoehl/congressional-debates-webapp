Major R. M. SAWYER,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Nashville, Tenn.:

Scouts just report that only 50 rebels have crossed at Eddyville, but that 50 others crossed below there; they think it a mere raiding party. Mounted men are after them now.

LOUISVILLE, March 29, 1864.

Colonel E. A. STARLING, Hopkinsville:

General Sherman informs me that Forrest is at Eddyville with his command. Concentrate your regiments immediately at Hopkinsville. Send out numerous scouting parties, particularly in the direction of Eddyville. If the enemy is found, contest every inch of ground, and fall back, if necessary, toward Bowling Green. Omit no precaution; don't be surprised; obey Colonel Maxwell's orders; report by telegraph your movements to him and me. We must act on the offensive, and fight against odds if necessary.

By order of Brigadier-General Burbridge:

Colonel C. MAXWELL,

Commanding Southwest Kentucky, Bowling Green:

General Sherman informs me that Forrest and command are at Eddyville. Concentrate the Fifty-second Kentucky and all the mounted men of Forty-eighth Kentucky at Bowling Green immediately. Any outpost in danger will be withdrawn. Colonel Starling is directed to feel the enemy and report to you; if in force he will fall back to Bowling Green, or where you may direct. Attend to Elk Fork bridge; the road north of Bowling Green will be attended to. Act on the offensive, and fight odds if necessary.

Brigadier-General HOBSON,

Cave City:

General Sherman reports Forrest with his command at Eddyville. If possible, have Thirty-seventh Kentucky remain at or near Cave City for the present. Direct Thirteenth Kentucky Cavalry to be ready to move in any direction. It will probably be needed by you. Communicate with Colonel Maxwell at Bowling Green and act in concert. Troops will be sent from here on line of railroad to Cave City. We must act on the offensive, and fight odds if necessary.

By order of Brigadier-General Burbridge:
