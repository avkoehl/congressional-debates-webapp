Major N. H. McLEAN,

Assistant Adjutant-General and Chief of Staff:

MAJOR: Special Orders, 58, has been received, and Coburn's brigade, consisting of the Fourteenth and Nineteenth Kentucky and Thirty-third Indiana and the Ninth Ohio Battery, have been ordered to proceed forthwith to Covington.

This battery is of four guns, and is sent forward as organized in Ohio. Temporarily two additional guns were assigned to it. They were manned by details of infantry which had been ordered to report to their respective commands.

I am, major, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Major General GORDON GRANGER,

Commanding, &amp;c., Covington, Ky.:

General Boyle telegraphs as follows:

Report here that rebels are crossing toward Lexington; another report that they are moving toward Richmond and Buell's army in motion for pursuit. I fear they will cross to Lexington with belief they can crush your force.

While either of these reports from General Boyle amy be true, the last is most probable. Yet our force should continue to move with caution.

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE OHIO,Cincinnati, Ohio, October 14, 1862.

Brigadier General J. T. BOYLE, Louisville, Ky.:

Manage the Smithland matters as you deem best, but if stores are sage I would advise against their removal at present. They are wanted at Nashville, I understand. Thanks for your caution regarding rebel movements. I scarcely think they will make the attempt, but it is possible; hence our cautious movements. Such a plan would involve a separation of their forces and so far be of great advantage to Buell. Our last reports indicate few rebels north of the Kentucky River.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General, Commanding.
