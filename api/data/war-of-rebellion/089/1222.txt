Flag-Officer PINCKNEY,

Commanding C. S. Naval Forces, North Carolina, Present:

FLAG OFFICER: I have received information from my picket-line that the enemy's troops sailed from Beaufort two days ago, the dispatch being dated the 19th instant. If this is reliable and the movement is intended for this place, they may be off here now, and prevented by the state of the weather yesterday and to-day from making the necessary observations for landing. If the weather had been clear for the past fifty-six hours, and it be true that their troops have sailed, I should conclude that, as they have not appeared, the movement is intended elsewhere.

I shall have to ask your aid, should it be necessary to place the rope and other obstructions on the rip. I will keep you informed.

Very respectfully,

W. H. C. WHITING,

Major-General.
