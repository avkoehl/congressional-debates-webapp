of discussing in its broadest latitude, would be in
order. The motion now made involves no more,
and is, therefore, likewise in order. If so, the ap-
peal oue;b.Uo be sustained.
The CHAIRMAN said he would briefly state
the grounds for his decwon. A bill had been com-
mitted by the House to in committee; and now
what was the duty of the committee when they en-
tered on the consideration of the bill? The House
had described by their rules what it must be First,
that the bill should be read through by the clerk for
information, second lhat it should be read by
clauses, to be amended and debated by clauses,
and when they 1 aa gone through the bill, noting
such amendments as .hey might make on •> sepa-
rate paper, that they should report it to the House.
The Clerk had now read the bill through, and bad
commenced reading it by clauses. They had
passed one and ca rae to the second The gentle
man from New York [Mr McKeon] had proposed
to amend it, which was in order, and on that
amendment he had proposed to debate the whole
merit  of the bill The Chair had decided this
was not ia order The gentleman then had moved
to rtnke out the enacting clause of the bill The
Chair had decided that it was not in order. And,
firu, because it was conira-y to the rule of pro-
ceeding laid down in 'he rules of the Howe, which
were laid without regard to expediency. It bad
been said by gentlenvn tint the rules of the House
governed in committee They did, *o far as they
were applicable Was the motion which was now
made, a motion to amend the bill? It was not It
was a motion to desuoy the b 1!. And did that
come within the law by which the House had given
their committee power lo proceed to read the bill
by clauses and amend pnd debate them separately1!
He apprehended not.
But me Chair d d rot r st here. He turned to
the parliamentary law, which dec'ared that when
a bill was referred to them by the House they
could not do—what? No', in the linguaee of ihe
gentleman from Georgia, [-ir CcrpER,] tVtroy
the bill; but that ih v coj'd n t -eject it That
was the language cf ibe law if the; struck out
tLeenactirge)?uv- oftV b 11 dil they noi rejee it?
It this mo km pre/tti'td, here was a bill of some
two or tire" hundred clangs, m the rii«cu„Mon of
lh  second cía se of which Ihey wt uld «Iiikp oat
the enacting clause, and report to the Hoa'e, not
that they had gun" through the biU and examined
clause by clause, but that they had rtjtcted 'he bill
without that examination.
Gentleman had sa d if toe decís on of the Chair
was sus'amrd, it would cut off deba'e The Chair
did not 'o ¿ederstwd it TL' ru e was ¡nu\ ígent
and reasonable, and, if this c m-n  t- e aciopt4 it,
they would see tie a «.at advantage of fo,rg
through the bill by clan rs, a d ducjssing the
clauses on their several merits Ard when the
committee should hive gone through the hll by
clauses, a motion to rise ¿n i report it to the Hiu'p
