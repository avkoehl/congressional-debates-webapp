Pre-emption to mtml mtthn—Mr* Mirrick,
Senwfe,,
had no idea of imposing any legal disability upon
them m the acquisition oi propert). He wished
them all well If any of tnem had settled upon
the public lands., so much the better It was <m
evidence oí iheu intention to become citizens, and
th ir labor upon the soil would add to Hi pro-
duct and to the national wealth In iepl) to
some remarks from Mr, Cl*y of Kentucky, in
which that Senator supported the amendment pio-
posed against foteigners, and thanked the Stnatoi
from Maryland for offering it, Mr B said there
was one class of politicians who had no right to
object to foreigners for any purpose, and that class
was those who were in favor of a national
bank w ith foreign stockholder Those «ho could
g<> that, he should suppose could have no objection
to foreigners for any thing, much less for the in-
nocent occupation ot cultivating the earth We
hpvc had two national banks, both largely owned
and contiolled by foreigners, and a third bank ot
the same kind    «till «anted Now what was
a national bank, that it shsuld be a place into
which foieigners were admitted without danget,
in the opinion of this class of politicians, while
they could not be admitted to the privileges ofa pre-
emption? What «as this national bank, of whit h
wt have had two, and for another ol «huh a ci r-
tatn political partv were so anxious? A national
bank «¡is the tutmshei ota national cm reno),
the regulator of nil heal banks, the legulatoi of
exchan& s foieign md domestic, die Kgulator of
the pinc of all stocks, of all properly, and ot all
produce in 1 it was, according to the theoiy of the
'ame paity, the Treasury of the United States A
national bank was a ''political machine," in the
language of Gen HamilUn, "of the eTeatest an
poitance to the Statt " As apolitical mac hint,
as «ell asa pecuniary insitntion, the two national
banks of the United S'atfs had openly and pi hhc-
ly actul Yet there were persons, and a part),
who could see no objection to placing such an in-
stitution m the hands ot foreigners' who could ve
no objection to vesting aliens withapowei ur
the currctirj, the propenv, the treason, politics,
and the elections of the country, and )et s iw the
gteatost daugci m a hundred dollars' woith of
land being sold to an alien' Accordm" to this
logic, a solitary alien cultivating the ^rounl < n
the fr< ntii rs of a re m< I State is oo t! mu i u t
character to be trusted with tin privilege of a ¡m-
emption ii^ht in aquaitor siction of land, bu ta
bandoffoiegn capitaU is, wielding lens of mil
lions of monej making mnnej out of tag's putting
up and putting el iw i the price of all piopcrty, in-
terfering in all electn ns, and bringing mousy to
bear upon all political question*, these, truly, «ere
innocent alim* from whom no harm «as to he ap-
piehenled and whos* chartered privileges having
been enjn)ed for forty )t'dts, must be injoeed lor
twenty years more, and, after that, for cvei' Such
is the logic with v Inch vvr are to be entcrtainel'
Such the contrail ctions «hich are gum to us to
sw tllow' But «hii is th  «1 ret of this nieoiisis-
tene v—wh U the cause 0 this contradiction—«hat
the reison of this dual ol a sohtaij cultiv itor
and tins lo\c fin d band of foreign capitali tsf
What 14 ti e icason wh) the sohtaiy cultivator is to
be denied the privilege of a pre-emption right ¡nan
hundred dollars' worth of land, and the foreign ca
pitalists ate to be allowed to wield the pecuniary
and the political p wer of toe country? What is
the leason of all this? Sir, the reason js one of m
ferenee and deduction Is it notpo'itioil? Is it not
beeause the cultiva'or is 1 Republican, and he-
cause the foreign capitalists are Monarchy s? Is it
not a political reason, «hich follows the law of
affunities adhering to what it loves, and reppllmg
w hat it dislikes'! The Senatoi from Kentucky (Mr
C¡ ty) h is th ml e>d the Senator f-om Man land lor
bri iging forw ard this amendrrent, ano I will thank
1 im f< r it also He shall have what raretj occurs
111 'his chamber, thaiks from boih sides of the
Hou*e' Ceitaml) 1 should never have stimulated
anv _entlem m to propose sue ham uon, hot Mine
it « as dine, I must be permit!' d to pxpitss thanks
for the ojipcrtnnity «hich it had afforded of con-
trasting the fears of a certain political party for a
few solttaiy foreigners cultivating the s< U, «uh
thair love ancj confidence in a band of au n lords
and ladies, wielding the power* of a national
bank.
Mr MERRICK said he had not anticipated op-
position from any quaitei to a proposition w!  .h
appeared to htm so obviously right ¡11 itself, ami
which, he could not but add, h« behoved to be so
loudlv cilledfor by a just legaid to the rights and
lmeiestsol the citizen  of this Union He lud
listened attentively to the aijumenis of hcuoi ible
Senators w ho hal risen m opposition, but had he. ml
nothing which did not tend to confirm the v tei s
and opinions which had prompted him to ohei the
amendment Indeed he had hoped, till the con
trary appeared, that the principlr and objet t c 1
