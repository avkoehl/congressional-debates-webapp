Report of Colonel Eli H. Murray, Third Kentucky Cavalry, commanding Third Division, of operations May 13-21 and August 18-23.
HDQRS. THIRD BRIGADE, THIRD CAVALRY DIVISION,Camp Crooks, Ga., September 14, 1864.

I have the honor to report the operations of the Third Cavalry Division, Department of the Cumberland, from the 13th to the 21st of May:

On May 13, at Smith's Cross-Roads, near Resaca, the general commanding division receiving a wound, the command devolved upon myself; and, turning over the command of my brigade to Colonel Atkins, commanding Ninety-second Illinois, I at once proceeded to carry out the instructions of Major-General Sherman, namely, to take possession of the cross-roads, thereby covering the formation of our infantry lines, which being accomplished, and in further pursuance of these orders, out my command in reserve, reporting to take commanding general. By his instructions Lay's Ferry was taken possession of, picketing it that night. 14th, moved, making demonstrations at Gideon's, Calhoun, and Lay's Ferries. At Calhoun, owing to the formation of the banks and direction of the streams, the guns of the enemy completely covered the crossing. Colonel Smith, Tenth Ohio Cavalry, commanding Second Brigade, moved and joined Major Wolfley, commanding Third Kentucky Cavalry, with a section of Tenth Wisconsin Battery, then there engaging the enemy. 15th, Major Wolfley, with Third Kentucky Cavalry and section of artillery at Gideon's Ferry, engaged the enemy. Opened an artillery fire on the retreating wagons and column of the enemy leaving Resaca. Colonel Atkins, with his brigade, at Calhoun Ferry, skirmishing. Colonel Smith, with his brigade, at Lay's Ferry, reconnoitered the river as far as Blaylock's Ferry, finding the enemy at every accessible point. At 11 p. m. my whole command at Calhoun Ferry, owing to a report of the enemy throwing a pontoon across the river - this proved false; on the contrary, found he was retreating, the stillness of the night causing us to hear the moving of artillery south - so reported to the commanding general.
