WAR DEPARTMENT, ADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE,

December 9, 1863.

EXECUTIVE MANSION, Washington, December 9, 1863.

His Excellency A. G. CURTIN,

Governor of Pennsylvania:

MY DEAR SIR: I have to urge my illness and the preparation of the message in excuse for not having sooner transmitted you the inclosed from the Secretary of War and Provost-Marshal-General in response to yours in relation to recruiting in Pennsylvania.* Though not quite as you desire, I hope the grounds taken will be reasonably satisfactory to you. Allow me to exchange congratulations with you on the organization of the House of Representatives, and especially on recent military events in Georgia and Tennessee.

Yours, very truly,

A. LINCOLN.

WAR DEPARTMENT, Washington City, December 9, 1863.

Honorable H. WILSON,

U. S. Senate, Washington, D. C.:

SIR: The Secretary of War directs me to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 30th ultimo, suggesting the propriety of issuing a proclamation offering pardon to all deserters who will return to their commands before the 1st of January. After having given the matter due consideration he has come to the conclusion that such a proclamation would not produce the result you anticipate. It would in his opinion greatly increase desertions from the Army, and would, moreover, be a pardon to the very worst class of deserters, who have heretofore escaped arrest, and who would be likely to desert again on the first opportunity. For these reasons it is not deemed expedient to change the present system, which so far has worked very satisfactorily.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ED. R. S. CANBY,

Brigadier-General and Assistant Adjutant-General.
