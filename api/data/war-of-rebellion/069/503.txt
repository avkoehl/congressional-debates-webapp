Major-General BURNSIDE:

The supply trains are moving to-day to Anderson's, on the route to White House, where they will be parked. I presumed General Williams had notified you. A train will leave for White House to-day and will probably leave our pass Anderson's early to-morrow. The empty wagons must take in wounded.

RUFUS INGALLS,Chief Quartermaster, Army of the Potomac.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, June 2, 1864.

Major-General BURNSIDE:

Your several dispatches but just now received. The major-general commanding directs me to reply that General Ferrero is with the trains force on your right covering that flank, the rest of Wilson's division being occupied in destroying the railroad, &amp;c. General Hancock was in communication with the cavalry on the right, which is pushed along the Hanover Court-House road. In respect to your changing the position of your troops, the commanding general will not limit you further than to direct that you do not change the left of your line where it connects with General Warren. Otherwise make the best disposition of your troops that, in your judgment, the ground admits.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
