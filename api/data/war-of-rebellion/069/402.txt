HEADQUARTERS SIXTH ARMY CORPS,May 31, 1864-1.50 p. m.

The following has been received from General Neill in relation to our right and rear:
HEADQUARTERS SECOND DIVISION, SIXTH ARMY CORPS,May 31, 1864-1.30 p. m.

Colonel McMAHON,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Sixth Corps:

A report from Colonel Edwards, commanding brigade at Taliaferro's Mill, says that some 20 of the enemy's cavalry have been seen on the right of his (Edwards') line of pickets, about half a mile in rear of the road from mill to Overton's, and Colonel E. asks for one or two companies of cavalry. I told him I had no cavalry, and that a brigade of General Wilson's cavalry had been ordered to connect with him. I deem this of sufficient importance to forward.

Very respectfully,

THOS. H. NEILL,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Second Division.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,May 31, 1864-2 p. m. (Received 2.45 p. m.)

Major-General WRIGHT,

Commanding Sixth Army Corps:

GENERAL: Wilcox's division, of Hill's corps, is in front of my left in works. They moved down from the front of our right and relived Longstreet within a very short time. My right is close to the enemy, also with Breckinridge in front; although my headquarters are fixed at the place mentioned before, yet I remain at the Shelton house during these operations.

Yours, &amp;c.,

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SIXTH ARMY CORPS,May 31, 1864-2.10 p. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

General Russell says it is quite impossible to cross the swamp in his front under the enemy's fire, and my own examination confirms it. The enemy's line is on the other crest, the first being a pit for skirmishes, which follows nearly our own skirmish line; the other, the main line, which breaks back a few hundred yards beyond our right. I don't think it advisable to attempt crossing here, and shall hold the two divisions ready to support Hancock, if needed. I have been using one battery on the enemy's line, and shall shortly open with another on a camp which can be seen from where I now am.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General, Commanding.
