A resolution, heretofore oflTared by Mr FILL-
MORE, to print 10,000 copies of the report of the
causes which have led to the de'aj. of the explor-
ing expedition, came up in its order

Mi McKIM said, tint seeing the chairman of
the Committee on Foreign Affairs [Mr. Howard]
was not in his seat, he moved to lay the resolution
on the table.
Mi FILLMORE hoped the gentlemau would
not press that motion, for his belief was that the
chati man of the Committee on Foreign Affairs was
not opposed to it
Mi. McKIM could not withdraw the motion, for
he believed the Executive was doing every thing in
his, power to bring the mattei to a satisfactory issue,
and the effect of this resolution would be rather to
impede than facilitate that object.
Mr FILLMORE then said he must be compelled
to ask for the yeas and nays , but, before they were
ordered,
Mr McKIM vaned his motion, by moving to
postpone the further consideration of the resolution
till lo morrow.
Mr TILLMORE said that, if the gentleman
would assign some good íeason for that motion, he
would not object to it
Mi McKIM replied that he had made the mo-
tion for the same reason he had made the othei.
Mr. FILLMORE rejoined that if he had not
good icason to believe that the chai) man of the
Committee on Foreign Aflairs was not opposed to
the resolution, he would assent to this motion, but
Ik In vmg otherwise, he could not
Mr McKIM was decidedly opposed to the reso-
lulion, foi lit was sensible that the two Govem-
mc its were doing emry thing in their power to
lirmj; Ihe question to a si istactory issue, and this
v.i nlil only lend, i! it had any elfect at all, to
widm t'ie bn < h In proper lime ill the informa-
tion w i ild be lud befoic tlie.n
Mr FILLMORE wanted it now, because he
and his constituents felt a deep interest in the mat-
te r, and the) had no apprehensions that the dis-
closures of the truth would have j. dangerous ten-
dfiioy Still, if any danger wa> tobe apprehended
tin lehom, it would be in the power of the Execu-
tive to withhold the information Mr F was so
lit willing to confide in the discretion of the Exe-
cutive, and surely ihe gentleman from Maryland
w is not less so.
Mr AD VMS expressed a hope that the gentle-
man would withdraw the motion Mr. A then al-
luded to the three letters in the National Intelligen-
cer of this morning, be' ween the British Minister
and Secretary Forsyth, communicated by Governor
Head to the Legislature of Upper Canada, and
commented upon the extraordinary circumstance of
the American Congress deriving its earliest know-
ledge of those documents through so distant and fo-
reign a source, when it ought long since to have
come in directly
Mr. McKIM would, with pleasure, acci de to the
gtntleman's wish, if he could do so consistently
w.tb what he held to be right and proper
Mi McK had seen the correspondence alluded
to, and regretted its publication as out of time As
tl.p gentleman, however, had adverted to it, he
would draw his attention to one point m the letter
of the British minister, vi7 that the whole affair
lud been tiansfeired to London, ind this presented
an additional reason against further agitating the
question at this time It was premature, and could
do nothing but embarrass the negotiation between
the two countries
Mr FILLMORE again resisted the motion, and
give, as an additional reason, th?t the information
might be incuspersible in case it should be deemed
expedient to aim the frontier.
Mr TLCTCHER of Vermont hoped the sub-
ject would not be postponed The district repre-
sented by him bordered on Canada to the extent of
half way across Vermont, and this outrage had
produced a great excitement among the people
there Three months had now been suffered to
pass, and all the information we had was furnish-
