GENERAL: Major General A. A. Humphrey's desires me to inform you that you are relieved from further duty with this corps, and will rejoin your corps without delay.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

SECRETARY OF WAR:*

PETERSBURG, February 8.

There was no fighting to-day, and quiet was once more resumed. The enemy still holds his position on Hatcher's Run. His lines have thereby been extended but not advanced. General Sorrel was wounded in the lungs, but the wound is not considered mortal. Colonel Hoffman, of Virginia, was killed in the fight Monday. Our loss will not reach 500. The enemy's loss is estimated on the treble that number. The dead have all been buried, and the wounded brought from the field. The enemy are erecting observations on our right. The heavy cannonading yesterday afternoon was caused by our artillery shelling the enemy's lines. Both sides were engaged to-day in strengthening their new lines.

E. O. C. ORD,

Major-General.
