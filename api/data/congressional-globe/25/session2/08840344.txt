to deserve conádence and to merit support, would
«ontmue to find in him a firm friend. He could
not well conceive how the vote he was abeut to
give conflicted with this sentiment. He had rea-
sons for voting against the resolution, which, from
the course the debate, had taken, he felt himself
now called upon to state, but there was not an
unfriendly feeling towards the State institutions
which mingled with those reasons. He had long
been of the opinion that the true interests of all
well regulated banks, and the convenience of the
Government and the safety of its funds, demanded
that an entire pract cal separation ought to take
place between the Go.tnment and the banko, that
no longer should the affairs of the one be commin-
gled with the arfan s of the other This he be-
lieved both the interests of the Government and tie
interests of tne banks demanded It is now pro-
posed by the resolution on the table, that hereafter
no discrimination should take place as to the kind
of money in which the public revenue should be
received, and the propuety of passing- the resolu-
tion must depend upon the construction given to
the joint resolution of April 30,1816, and also upon
the expediency of restraining the exercise of Execu-
tive discretion under that rest lulion If the reso-
lution of 18J 6 is general, impera'ive, and obliga-
tory, he entuely concurted with the Senator from
South Carolina, that there would be no occasion
for the passage ot the joint resolution now on the
table, but he totally differed with the Senators from
Massachusetts and South Carolina as to the true
character, the lair import, of the joint resolution et
April, 1816 It is contended by those gentlemen
that the resolution is obligator}, absolute, and
imperative, that it is general in its provisions and
mandatory m its teims
He entnely differed from those gentlemen in this
matter He did not, for himself, believe that that
resolution could fairly orjustly receive such a con-
struction Tint it hid ever received such a prac-
tical construction by those charged with the execu-
tion oí the laws, none would pretend He had, on
a former occasion, given, veiy muth in detail, his
views upon this subject, and alter what had been
said pending this debate, he felt no necessity, or
even a disposition, to repeat his foimer arguments
But he hazarded nothing in saj mg that, under
every Administration since the adoption ot the re-
solution, the construction for which he now con-
tended had been given to it It has umfoimly been
regaided as a resolution, not geneial and universal
in its obligations, not of i.e binding and absolu e
force of positive law, but meiely permissive in its
character The law of 178D required the levenues
to be collected in gold and silver, special acts made
Treasury notes receivable for the public dues, and
the charter of ihe Bank of the United States had de-
clared that the bills of that bank should also be re-
ceived in payment of all taxes, and for debts du
the Government The joint resolution of 1816 was
not called for to re-enact the provisions of tho e
existing statutes [t neither added to, oi tookfrom,
the power of those laws u Inch made Treasury notes
or the bills of the Bank of the United States n-
ceivable. But the resolution was passed to correct
an existing, a growing, and an alarming evil The
Treasury Dep irtment had, from necessity, during
the period of the war, been obliged to receive
for the customs, for direct taxes, and for every
description of the pub'ic dues, tho notes of
non-specie payi'ig bank This had been
done not only without law, but against law
Necessity alone had compelled the Department to
this cour e, and it v. as to check this evil that the
joint resolution of 1816 was offered The Sena-
toi from Massaehuset's sajs that when he first
proposed the íesoluuon, it did not contain the pro-
vision permuting tho receipt of the notes of banks
v. hich are payable and paid on demand m the legal
currency of the countiy, that this was added by
way ot amendment Suppose the resolutioa had
been parsed p-eci el} in the terms in which it was
offeied by the Senatoi from Massachusetts, would
it have added an iota to the exiting law^ Cer-
tai ly rut The purpose wa> to correct an evil
practice, and not to enlarg  the *novisions ot exist-
ing statules And if Congress had adopted the
precise resolution offered by the Senator from Mas-
sachusetts, a would have been nothing more and
nothing less than a declaration on the part of Con-
gress, that the Secretary of the Treasury must
thereafter desist from the receipt of local paper. But
the resolution was amended, and will it be said
that, by the terms of the resolution, the Secretary
of the Treasury could require the revenues to be
collected in the bills oí the Bank of the United
States, to the exclusion of specie, and of Treasury
notes? Certainly not. Will it be said that he
could require the revenues to be collected in the
bills of local banks, to the exclusion of the notes
of the Bank of the United States' Certainly not
The resolution provides that the Secietary of the
Treasury "adopt such measures as he may deem ne-
cessary to came, as soon as may be, all duties, taxes,
debts, or sums of money accruing, orbecomaigpayable to
the United States, to be collected and paid " Hon1 In
what' lst,in the legal currency oftheUmtedStates,
2d, m Treasury notes, 3d, or notes of the banks
of the United Slates," which mediaof payment were
then, by law, provided and declared, and the reso'
lution further adds "oí in notes of banks t<Inch ai e
payable and paid on demand, m the legal cm rency of
the United States " He would ask that, it the reso-
lution had simply provided that the Secretary of
the Treasury "ought to adopt such measmes as he
may deem necessaiy to cause, as soon a  may be,
all dutie--, taxes, debts, cce to be paid tn the notes
of banks which aie payable, and paid on demand,
in specie," and contained nothing mote, whether it
would have repealed the act of 1815 making Trea-
sury notes receivable1 and whether it would have
made it the bounden dut\ of the Secretary to have
received such notes' He thought this could not,
with propriety, be contended1 The very language
of the resolution gives to the Secretary a discretion-
ary power—it does not impose an imperious obli-
gation It is either one thing oi the other—it is
either absolutely obligatory, or else confided to the
sound discretion of the Secretary He believed th.it
this whole matter, by the turn ol the resolution
itself, was within the discretion and tontiol of the
Executive He believed ihat the resolutan was
introduced and passed to coirect an existing evil—
to give to the Department the sanction of Congress
Ihat no further disiegaul of existing laws, in the
collection of the revenues, would be countenanced
Such a di claration was made necessary the state
and condition of the country, the ling continued
practice of tl e Dipartmcnt, in the c< lltction of ír-
íadeemable bank papei, absolute!} required such
an a< lion on the part Congress, m order to pioduce
a change in the practice There was no alteration
whatevei m the obligal on of existing laws, by the
adoption of the íesoluuon o  April, 1816
By tht sixteenth «ection of the charter of the Bank
of the United Stales, which was incoiporaied in
1816, it was piovided "that the dent sites of the
money of the United States, in places in which the
said bank and the branches theieof may be esta
blished, sha'l be made m said bank and the branches
thereof, in less tin SeercUrj ot the Treasury shall
at any time othirmse oidtr and direct " And by
thefiiteenth tent not h  sam  ch?rter it was made
the duty of the Un u, 1 St tes Bank to transfer the
public funds from place to place, without charge
to the Government, as the bank might be thereto
required
After the adoptun ot the resolution, the no'es of
local banks whioh should be received in pursuance
of its provisions constituted " a portion of the mo-
ney of the United States," and if the constiuctton
given to that resolution by the Senator from Mas-
sachusetts be correct, the Bank of he United States
was bound to receive this description of niorey on
deposite, and was equalh bound to transfer it as a
pait of the public funds, as the Secroury of the
Treasury might fiom time to time require, and that
without charge to the Government And }etone
of the first acts of the Bank of the United Stales,
after its mcorpoiation, was a refusal to receive the
notes of all specie p<.}ing banks m deposite, and to
ccdit the Government thereioi as cash, and <i re-
fusal to transfer, in effect, this part of the public
funds, when required by the Secretary of the Trea-
sury
Tne resolution of 1816 was thus regaided by the
United States Bank, and by the Secretary of the
Treasury, as it has ever since been regarded, not
as imperative and obligatory, but merely as disere
tionary and permissive; and was then, and has
ever since been, tieated accordingly. The seleet
committee appointed in J 823 to examine the
charges against Mr Crawford, then Secretary of
the Treasury, so tieated the matter. The charges
made against Mr Crawford necessarily produced a
commentary upon the joint resolution of April,
1816.   The committee remarked that—
" At the time of the adoption oí this resolution,
debts accruing to the United States, whether on ac-
count of the sales of public lands, orat the custom-
house, or from other sources of revenue, were, in
fact, received in some parts of the country, but
evidently in disregard of the law, in the notes of
the State banks which did not redeem their paper
by cash payments By this resolution, it was ob-
viously made the duty of the Treasury Department
to correct ihat departure from Law as soon as prac-
ticable, and it was, as i  equally obvious, impera-
tive on the Department, aftei the 20th February,
1317, to allow nothing to be received m payment
of debts due to the United States, but the legal
money of the UBiled Stales, Treasury notes, notes
of the Bank of the United States, or of those State
banks, the notes of which were payable and paid on
demand in cash "
And it would teem that language could not be
more explicit, that the Secretary was not, after the
20th of February, 1817, " to allow" to be received
depreciated local bank paper, m the collection of
the public dues, but it the notes of State institutions
should be received, the Secretary should allow only
those "payable and paid on demand" in the legal
currency of the United States, to be received.
There is not in the resolution a partial duection to
the Secretaiy of the Treasury to receive even this
descuption ot local papei
Mr Crawford had made large permanent depo-
sites with certain local banks, amounting to nina
hundred thousand dollars, the interest on which
would be $54,000, and the committee state that,
"It is alleged m th  memorial, that this sum of
fifty-four thousand dollars was thus annually paul
lor receiving and transmitting the public money;
a service which, it is said, the Bank of the United
States was bound to perform without any compen-
sation. The committee does not see the ground of
this obligation on the Bank of the United States.
That institution is, indeed, bound to give necessary
facilities for transferring the public funds from
place to place, but this can only mean cash funds,
and it is bound, also, to receive money tn deposite
for the United States, but it is not bound to receive
in deposite as cash, the bills of any banks whatever
but its own, although they may come within the
provision* of the resolution of 1816 The commit-
tee do not peiceive any thing m the principle of
these arragements with the banks, either in viola-
tion of law, or contraiv to the usage of the Go-
vernment, since the Treasury has, tor many} ears,
had agreements with more or less of the banks, by
which the public monejs were deposited in such
banks, and drawn from them when wanted, certain
terms and conditions, as to the mode of drawing,
being stipulated, such as were thought beneficial,
buth to the Treasi ry and the banks "
He could not well understand how the commit-
tee could exonerate Ml Craw ford from the charge
against him, if the joint resolution of 1816 was
general m its character, and universal in its obliga-
tion If the resolution had received the construc-
ts i then which is now given to it, the course of
Mr Crawfoid would have been plain, and any de-
parture from that course would have provoked the
severest reprehension If the resolution had been
then considered as obligatory, Mr. Crawford would
have been bound to receive the noies of specie pay-
ng banns, and to have deposited the same m the
B?nk of the United States and its branches
But Mr Crawford gave to the resolution the
same ccnstruction prior to the investigation of the
committee in 1823 wnich hus been uniformly
biven to it since at the Treasury Department.
" On the 1st of August, 1820, the Treasury
issued circular instructions to the receivers of
public moneys, authorizing them to receive, in
addition  to specie and bills of the  Bank of Ü
