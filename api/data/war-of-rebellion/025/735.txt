EARL VAN DORN,

Major-General.

HOLLY SPRINGS, October 22, 1862.

General PEMBERTON:

Bragg is falling back; so reported. We may now expect a large force to land at Columbus and Memphis very shortly. Do you think it advisable to send off the troops ordered to Meridian now? They are ready and only await transportation. Reported eleven regiments at Bone Yard; ten regiments at Chewalla; large force at Rienzi; cavalry at Jumpertown.

EARL VAN DORN,

Major-General.

HOLLY SPRINGS, MISS., October 22, 1862.

SECRETARY OF WAR:

Bragg is reported to be falling back toward Cumberland Gap. It may be presumed that large re-enforcements of the enemy will soon be thrown into West Tennessee at Columbus and Memphis. Already several thousand men have arrived. If we are not strengthened here we shall lose this State. There are indications of preparations for an advance. Can any part of Bragg's force be thrown here?

EARL VAN DORN,

Major-General.

JACKSON, MISS., October 22, 1862.

Major General EARL VAN DORN, Holly Springs:

If the enemy increases in strength and there is evidence of his intention to advance you will take position behind the Tallahatchie.

J. C. PEMBERTON,

Lieutenant-General, Commanding.
