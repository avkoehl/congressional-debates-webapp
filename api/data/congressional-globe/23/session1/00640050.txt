Lake Michigan, Michigan Territory, and for sur-
veying the bars at the mouths of both these rivers.
Resolved, That the Committee on Commerce be
instructed to inquire into theexpediency of an ap-
propriation for surveying the flats in Lake St.
Clair, at the mouth of St. Clair river, and also for
removing the Bar, and building a pier, if necessary,
at the mouth of the river Clinton, in Lake St.
Clair, in the Territory of Michigan.
REMOVAL OF THE DEPOSITES.
The consideration of the report of the Secretary
of the Treasury on the removal of the deposites
came up in order.
Mr. CLAY said he regretted he was compelled
to ask for a further postponement of this subject.
The unexampled pressure in the money market
he was aware required some expression on the
part of the Senate with as little delay as possible.
It would be weil recollected that a call had been
made upon the Secretary of the Treasury for cer-
tain papers alluded to in his report; these have not
yet been received; he had supposed that they
â– would have been ready by to-day, and that he
should not have been compelled to ask for any
further delay. But as the correspondence alluded
to has not been received, he asked a further post-
ponement until Thursday next.
Mr. FORSYTH said he had no kind of objec-
tion to the postponement. But he would suggest
to the gentleman from Kentucky, that if he would
turn over the printed public documents he would
find aii the correspondence he wanted. He (Mr.
P.) understood that all the gentleman wanted was
to ascertain whether the Secretary had put the
proper construction upon Mr. Crawford's letters.
The call of the gentleman seemed to Mr. F. very
extensive, and he thought it would require more
time to copy it all than was allowed by the pro-
posed postponement.
Mr. CLAY hoped there would be no objection
to the day suggested. The documents alluded to
by thegentleman were in four volumes, and it was
impossible to select out of them the correspondence
referred to. But he would say that he had read
a great portion of it, and he was unable to find in
it a single passage justifying the construction put
on it by the Secretary; but, on the contrary, doc-
trines the very reverse of it. He asked, what was
no more than fair, that the Secretary should state
his own case.
The postponement till Thursday was agreed to.
On motion of Mr. FORSYTH, the bill for the
relief of John A. Webster was laid on the table.
On motion of Mr. BENTON, the Senate then-
went into the consideration of Executive busi-
ness, which occupied their attention to the hour
of adjournment.

of this kind. The usage had been for each House,
during Christmas week, to adjourn to the third
day from the day preceding Christmas. He did
not expect that the House would do much busi- j
ness during this week, but he hoped it would do
some business,                                                      |
Mr. EVERETT said it had been usual, when
Christmas occurred on Wednesday, to adjourn
over to the following Monday. At this stage of
the session it was not usual for the House to sit
on Saturdays.

that the resolution lie on,the table indefinitely.

according to the rule, lie one day, and claimed the

drew it, at the request of several members, who
wished the sense of the House to be taken at once
upon the adjournment.
"Mr. POLK renewed the call for the application,
of the rule, and the joint resolution lies accordingly
on the table for one day.
