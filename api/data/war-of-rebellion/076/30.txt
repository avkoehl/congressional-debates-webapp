The enemy has disappeared from my entire front, and my troops have been in pursuit since daylight. Please direct Garrard to feel upon our left.

GEO. H. THOMAS.

Major-General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, near Kenesaw, July 3, 1864.

General THOMAS:

I will go to Marietta, to the south of Kenesaw, and will communicate to you from there. Will expect to find you substantially on the railroad, on the direct pursuit. Garrard has already got orders which will carry him east of Marietta.

W. T. SHERMAN

Major-General, Commanding.

SHERMAN'S HEADQUARTERS,

July 3, 1864.

General THOMAS:

I have sent Audenried to you, telling that Stoneman's cavalry has pursued the enemy across the Chattahoochee near Campbellton. Schofield reports all quiet in his front, and I have ordered him to cross Nickajack Creek. I want you with your entire army to follow substantially the main army till he is across the Chattahoochee or makes a stand. McPherson will occupy Marietta and Kenesaw until further developments, and Garrard's cavalry will feel over toward Roswell Factory.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, Marietta, Ga., July 3, 1864-6.45 p.m.

General THOMAS:

The more I reflect the more I know Johnston's halt is to save time to cross his material and men. No general, such, as he, would invite battle with the Chattahoochee behind him. I have ordered McPherson and Schofield to cross Nickajack at any cost and work night and day to get the enemy started in confusion toward his bridges. I know you appreciate the situation. We will never have such a chance again, and I want you to impress on Hooker, Howard, and Palmer the importance
