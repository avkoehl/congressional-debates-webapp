Major General WADE HAMPTON,

Commanding Hampton's Division:

GENERAL: The enemy's wagon train is in motion toward Germanna and Ely's. It is seen from Clark's Mountain. General Stuart has telegraphed to General Rosser to move up at once to those points. He desires you to move the other two brigades, with all the forage you can have and rations for your men, to the plank road, so as to delay and watch the enemy, who will probably cross late this afternoon at Germanna or Ely's. You can obtain hard bread and bacon from Major Johnson, chief commissary of subsistence, at Orange Court-House, if your brigade commissaries are not already supplied.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. B. McCLELLAN,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.
