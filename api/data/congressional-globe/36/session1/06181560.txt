THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
April 5,
objection I have referred to, but which, under the
rules of the House, I am not permitted to state,
constitutes a sufficient reason with me for voting
in the negative.
Mr.,COBB said: Mr. Speaker, I give my vote
with great doubt. If I err at all, I have the con-
sciousness that I err upon the side of morality.
I vote in the affirmative.
The vote was then announced, a^ above re-
corded.
Mr. MAYNAltD moved to reconsider the vote
by which the biil was passed; and also moved
that the motion to reconsider be laid upon the
â€¢ table.
The latter motion was agreed to.
PUBLIC PRINTING}.
Mr. SHERMAN. I move that the rules be
suspended, and the House resolve itself into the
Committee of the Whole on the state of the
Union.
Mr. HASKlN. I desire the gentleman will
yield to me to make a motion for the postpone-
ment of the further consideration of a special order
fixed for this day.
Mr. SHERMAN. I yield for that purpose.
Mr. HASKiN. I move that the further con-
sideration of the resolutions relative to the public
printing, reported from the Committee on Public
Expenditures, and which was .set down for this
day, be postponed until Thursday next.
The motion was agreed to.
JAPAN MINISTER.
Mr. BURLINGAME. -1 ask the unanimous
consent of the lioiwe to take from the Speaker's
table Senate resolution No. 23, m tcgard to the
minister fiom Japan.
There was no objection. The joint resolution
was read a first and second time, and, on motion
of Mr. Burungamk, refened to the Committee
on Foreign Aft'dirs.
CONTJCSTK L> KLJCCTI0 X.
Mr. 8fOKLE?S. Mr. Speaker, 1 rise to a ques-
tion of privilege.
Mr. SHERMAN. There can be no higher
quorum of privilege than the motion I submit to
go into the Committee of the Whole on the state
of the Union, and 1 insist on its being put.
Mr. SICKLES. I desire to presentto the House
some papers in reference to the contest for my seat
upon this floor, between Mr."Williamson and my-
self, in order to have them referred to the Com-
mitter of Elections. Before they are referied, 1
ask that a portion of them, which I have maiked,
may be read. It will be ivmemhered that, on the
^lst of March last, this House passed a resolution
requiring Mr. Williamson to serve upon t'ne a
particular statement of the grounds upon which
lie asserted his claim to my seat. On Saturday
last I received from him a paper purporting to be
such a statement. The paper is substantially a
mere repetition of the petition heretofore presented
to the House and, of course, if the House did not
require something more to be served on mo than
a mere rehearsal of the contents of that petition,
it would not lmve required him to serve a further
paper. I hold his notice in my hand. I have
prepared a specification of the objections to that
notice, showing its insufficiency and the impossi-
bility for me to take issue upon it, or to proceed
to take testimony upon it. I desire to have this
papericad.
Mr. SHERMAN. 1 submit whether this is a
question of privilege. Jt is a matter for the Com-
mittee of Elections.
Mr. SICKLES. U touches the right of a mem-
ber to a seat upon this floor; and therefore, it, is
a question of high privilege.
Mr. SHERMAN. I do not sec how, in this
incidental way, we can go into the validity of this
. notice.
Mr. SICKLES. I wish the House to know
the character of the papers I submit; and then
to have them referred to the Committee of Elec-
tions.
Mr. SHERMAN. I have no objection to the
reference.
Mr. SICKLES. There are portions of the
papery that I deem it material should be read.
Mr. SHERMAN. 1 object to the reading of
the papers. Itwill unnecessarily consume the time
of trie House. Let the papers go to the Commit-
tee of Elections; and when it is proper to bring
the mattei\hefore the House for its consideration,
that committee, which has the power toareportat
any time, will submit its report.
Mr. SICKLES. The papers are not volumin-
ous. I desire the nature of the objections made,
as well as the character of the notice, to be under-
stood by the House.
Mr. SHERMAN. 1 douotthinkthatitis proper
to have the papers read at this stage of the pro-
ceedings. I object.
Mr. SICKLES. I have the light to have the
papers read. I insi&t that they be read as a por-
tion of my speech.
Mr. BURNETT. It seems tome that the pro-
position is one of the highest privilege. It touches
his right to a scat upon this floor. Even leaving
that point out of view, we have the right to have
a paper read which it is proposed to refer.
The SPEAKER. The Chair is of the opinion
that the gentleman is entitled to have the paper
read.
The Clerk, read as follows;

That thereupon the panics were to be allowed sixty days
to take testimony upon the issues thus joined;
That, on the 2-tth of Maich ultimo, the said Amor J. Wil-
liamson, iu his newspaper,called the Weekly Dispatch,
published in the said city, printed an article inthe editorial
columns of.  aid papei, of, and concerning, said controversy,
the concluding paiaginph of which solicited uifoimation
from any and all pcisotis, which would enable said Wil-
liamson to support the allegations in his petition presented
to the House on the <)th of t'obiuaiy ultimo, which para-
giaph is in the woid- following, to wit*
In tin1 mean time, all pames interested in this case,on
behalf of the contestant, are invited to communicate with
Allied Melntwe, Esq , attorney at law, whose office is at
No 929 Broadway. The contestant feels confident that he
will he able to more than sub-tantiate all the allegations
in his petition ; but, at the same tune, lie begs to say thru
he will be obliged to his friends and the citizens of the dis-
tnct foi all mf'oimatmn which, m then judgment, may aid

thud congressional district
That the undcr.-igned waited in the cit> of Washington
unt'l Thuwhn evening last, r29tii ultimo, to receive fli" said

and having occasion to go to the city of New Yoik. the
undesigned intormed the ebauioan of tiie Committee ol*

son's- place of hiu>me > to inquire whether he intended to
serve any notice upon the undersigned, and if so, that he
would wait until five o'clock, p.m., at the office of the
city inspector, for the service of the same ;
That soon afterwards, the counsel of the said William-
son, Alfred McJntyre, E-q , and another p'rt-on, came to
the said office and served upon the undesigned a paper
purporting to be the particular statement ot' the ground- of
said contest, required by said resolution to be served as

knowledge or any illegal votes having been polled, upon
winch he can base a charge against the undersigned, or else,
having such knowledge or information, he conceals and
withholds it from the undeisigned;

don charges which he cannot particularly specify, or else
to disclose the paiticulars of them, so as to enable the un-

thereupon to admit oi deny them in hi-> aiiMvei;

l nr canvas-ers, acting in the twenty-eight election pre-
cincts embraced within the said congiessional di-trict, vari-
ous acts of fraud and criminal misconduct in and about the
said election, yet no specific act is charged against any one
inspector or canvasser, nor is arty inspector or canva^cr

dersigned, in consequence of the misconduct ehanred, to
oveieome the pluialitvofone hundred and sixty one' votes
received hy the undersigned ;
That out of the twenty eight election precincts embraced
within the said concessional district, onlvtwo poeincts,
namely: the third and fomth pieeinets of thtf first waid,aie
partn ularly specified in the descnption of fraudulent p o-
ceedtngs contained m tiie contestant's statement, although
the like charges are made in general temw as to all the pre-
cincts ; not is it alleged how many votes the contestant lo-t,

fum inspectors thus vaguely impugned, not one is specified ;
