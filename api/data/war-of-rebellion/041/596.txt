Lieutenant COOLEY:

Send this to Cahill:

If you cannot get along on the train, march your men on the railroad track. Hurry your force to New Orleans, leaving one regiment at Boutte Station. Destroy track and bridges as you pass.

Lieutenant JAMES C. COOLEY:

Contrive to get this message to Colonel Cahill at any cost:

Hurry to this city with such force as you can bring. A gunboat lies at the red brick church, opposite to Boutte Station Landing.

By command of Brigadier-General Emory:

[FRANK W. LORING,]

Aide-de-Camp.
HEADQUARTERS DEFENSES OF NEW ORLEANS,June 25, 1863.

Colonel CAHILL:

Send Colonel Dyer's regiment to Algiers. Leave one regiment at Boutte Station; if attacked, to fall back to the gunboat on the river. Bring all the rest of your force to New Orleans as rapidly as possible.

Order the train to come to Algiers, and return at full steam.

W. H. EMORY,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEFENSES OF NEW ORLEANS,June 25, 1863.

Colonel CAHILL:

I wish all the regiments, except that to be left at Boutte Station, when they return, to take as nearly as may be their old position. I wish no time to be lost in getting here.

I have decided not to burn Des Allemands Bridge at present; but you will leave a picket there to do so should it become necessary, for we shall take Port Hudson within three days, and then we shall take Brashear.

By command of W. H. Emory, brigadier-general, commanding:

[FRANK W. LORING,]

Aide-de-Camp.
HEADQUARTERS DEFENSES OF NEW ORLEANS,June 25, 1863-9.45 a. m.

Major-General BANKS:

Two regiments of Colonel Cahill's have at length reached Boutte Station. He is at Raceland with the balance of his force. His tardiness of movement is inexplicable.

W. H. EMORY,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
