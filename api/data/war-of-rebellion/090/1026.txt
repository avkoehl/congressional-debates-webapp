drove them back across the Opequon in the p. m. McCausland sent vedettes on Gordon's right from his position at Beeson's Ford. All was quiet on the 30th, but the enemy made some demonstrations along the Opequon on the 31st, which were met by our cavalry. Anderson on the 31st marched to near Winchester and Rodes marched to Martinsburg and back on a reconnaissance (see plate ---*).

Quiet prevailed September 1, but on the 2nd the enemy was reported moving in force toward Berryville, and three divisions of the army were marched across the country to near Stone Chapel, when Vaughn's brigade of cavalry, which had been left at Bunker Hill, having been stampeded by the enemy, who thus got on Johnson's flank and routed the whole line (see plate ---*), capturing wagons, &amp; c., when Rodes, who had been left at Stephenson's, formed and drove the enemy back to Bunker Hill, and the army came back to the vicinity of Brucetown and Stephenson's. McCausland moved from Brucetown to Rodes' right (see plate ---*); Fitz Lee and Anderson moved toward Berryville. On the morning of the 3rd the enemy's cavalry appeared at White Post, and Fitz Lee moved to Newtown to guard our rear. Anderson advanced to Berryville and found the enemy's infantry there, and drove a portion of it handsomely from some earth-works (see plate ---+). Rodes moved to Bunker Hill and supported our cavalry in a fight there in the morning (see plate ---*). At night Gordon marched to Winchester. On the 4th Ramseur, Wharton, and Rodes marched to Berryville via "Burnt Factory," and moved to the left of General Anderson and had some skirmishing with the enemy, whom we found well fortified in our entire front (see plate ---+). The enemy's cavalry returned from White Post to-day; Gordon remained to guard the approaches to Winchester. After remaining in front of the enemy at Berryville until 2 p. m. of the 5th the divisions of Rodes, Wharton, and Ramseur returned by the same route they had advanced to Stephenson's; Rodes, in front, reached there just in time to form a brigade on the right of our cavalry, which was falling back before Averell's superior force, and aid in driving him several miles through a hard rain with loss (see plate ---*). Anderson marched back in the a. m. to the west side of the Opequon. It was quiet on the 6th, but on the 7th the enemy made demonstrations near Brucetown at the Yellow House, on the Martinsburg road, and also on the Millwood and Front Royal roads not far from Winchester. They were repulsed at all points. It was quiet again on the 8th, owing to the hard rain, but on the 9th the enemy advanced to the Opequon, below Brucetown, and burned some mills; Wharton marched out to meet them. September 10, we marched, Rodes in front, through a very hard rain beyond Darkesville, preceded by some of Lomax's division. Near Darkesville we encountered the enemy's cavalry and drove it off (see plate ---*), our cavalry pursuing through Martinsburg, when the enemy retired across the Opequon, their whole force being on the south side of that stream. The infantry returned to Bunker Hill, the cavalry remained at Darkesville.

On the 11th the infantry marched back to Stephenson's, the cavalry remaining at Darkesville. It was quiet on the 12th, but on the 13th the enemy advanced by the old Charlestown road, and we had an artillery engagement across the Opequon, lasting most of the day (see
