MILLER'S OR FERILY'S BRIDGE,

March 1, 1865-12 m.

General J. C. DAVIS,

Commanding Fourteenth Corps:

GENERAL: The First Division, Twentieth Army Corps, is now in camp at Johnson's, on the main road to Chesterfield. The road from Horton's Tavern to that point is excellent and the bridge at this point new and in good order. If you have sufficient forage on hand I think it would be well to send your trains direct to this point, after which they can move to the left of the road taken by the Twentieth Army Corps. I wish to hear from you to-night so that I may regulate the movements of the Twentieth Army corps somewhat by yours. I have heard nothing from you since I left you yesterday morning.

Yours, respectfully,

H. W. SLOCUM,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS FOURTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Russell Place, Five Miles of Hanging Rock, March 1, 1865.

[Major-General SLOCUM, Commanding:]

GENERAL: We are at last on the road and fairly off again. The roads improve by and above the river, but are bad still. We are pushing, and will continue to do so. The pontoon bridge cold not be gotten out until last night. The enemy attacked and skirmished quite sharply the rear guard while taking up the bridge. I shall report to-night again. My advance is six miles beyond this.

Yours, very respectfully,

JEF. C. DAVIS,

Brevet Major-General, Commanding.

Major-General SLOCUM, Commanding:

GENERAL: Morgan is at Horton's; Baird and Carlin here. The road over the hill at this place is very bad. If the bridge at McManus' is standing I think Morgan can reach Blakeny's to-morrow night. The other divisions will not be far behind. My orders are to march at daylight and go into camp at dark. I sent a communication to you this morning by return messenger. Ludlow left me about 1 p.m., and must have reported to you by this time. Make your calculations upon everything being done that men and animals can accomplish in catching up with you. I will dispatch you in the morning again.

Yours, very respectfully,

JEF. C. DAVIS,

Brevet Major-General, Commanding.
