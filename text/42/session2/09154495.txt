GEO. F. EDMUNDS.
Managers on the part of the Senate.
JAS. A. GARFIELD,
F. W. PALMER,
Managers on the,, part oj the House.
Mr. MORTON. I ask the Secretary to read
again that part of the report which refers to
the powers of the supervisors of elections.
The Chief Clerk read as follows :
And provided further, That the supervisors herein
provided for shall have no power or authority to
make arrests or to perform other duties than to be
in the immediate presence of the officers holding
the election and to witness all their proceedings,
including the counting of the votes and the making
of the returns thereof.
Mr. MORTON. I ask the Senator from
Vermont if I understand correctly that this
simply makes the supervisors silent spectators
without even the power to challenge a vote?
Mr. EDMUNDS. No, sir. They have no
power to challenge a vote except that which
belongs to a citizen, under the existing laws.
Underthe existing law, in cities of twenty thou-
sand inhabitants or more the power of the
supervisors is to be officially present where
they can be in the immediate presence of the
officers having charge of the election and to
observe- the voting and to witness the count-
ing of the votes and the.making up of the re-
turns, so that .they shall know precisely what
the truth is. Under existing law they never
had the slightest power to make arrests or to
interfere with the course of the procedure in
any way. The House insisted upon having
this provision put in as a means of composing
their differences in the other body, to which
we were forced to assent with a view to getting
to an end.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The ques-
tion is on concurring in the report of the com-
mittee of conference.
Mr. THURMAN. I do not wish to debate
it. I merely ask for the yeas and nays.
The yeas and nays were ordered.
Mr. STEVENSON. I did not sign that
report for the reason that I did not believe
Congress had any authority to exercise power
over the State elections under the Consti-
tution of the United States; but if Congress
had the power, I should not very much object
to the proviso here as it is in the amendment.
Believing as I do that the power is not within
the constitutional competency of Congress, I
shall vote against the report.
Mr. HITCHCOCK. On all political ques-
tions 1 am paired with the Senator from West
Virginia, [Mr. Davis.] I should vote "yea,"
and he would vote "nay."
Mr. CAMERON. I am paired with the
Senator from Virginia, [Mr. Johnston.] I
should vote "yea," if at liberty to do so.
Mr. KELLOGG. I desire to state that the
Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Wilson] is
absent. If he were present he would vote
"yea."
The question being taken by yeas and nays,
resultedâyeas 39, nays 17 ; as follows :
YEASâMessrs. Alcorn, Ames, Anthony, Boreman,
Buckingham, Caldwell, Carpenter, Chandler, Clay-
ton, Cole, Conkling. Corbett. Cragm, Edmunds lerry
of Michigan, Flanagan, Irelinghuysen, Harlan,
Howe, Kellogg, Logan, Morrill of Maine, Morrill of
Vermont, Morton. Nve, Osborn, Pomeroy. Pool,
Pratt, Ramsey, Robertson, Sawyer, beott Sherman,
Spencer, Stewart, Sumner, West, i-nd Windom 39.
NAYSâMessrs. Bayurd, Blair, Cusseriy, Cooper,
Fenton, Hamilton of Texas, Kelly, Norwood, Ran-
som, Saulsbury, Sprague, Stevenson.Stocktoii, ibur-
rnan, Tipton. Trumbull, and Vickersâ17. .
ABSENTâMessrs. Brownlow, Cameron, Uayis ot
Kentucky. Davis of West Virgini i, Ferry ot Con-
necticut, Gilbert, Goidthwaite, Hamilton of Mary-
land, Hamlin, Hill, Hitchcock, Johnston, Lewis,

So the report was concurred in.
