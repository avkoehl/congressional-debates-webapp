3iail costjiacts.
Mr. RAMSEY. I move that the Senate
resume the consideration of House bill No.
1930. It can be disposed of in five minutes.
The motion was agreed to: and the Senate,
as in Committee of the Whole, resumed the
consideration of the bill (H. R. No. 1930) re-
lating to proposals and contracts for the trans-
portation of the mails, and for other purposes.
Mr. RAMSEY. Ttie amendments are all
gone through except one offered by myself
and one offered by the Senator from Califor-
nia. I hope they will both be accepted.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Secretary
will report the amendment proposed the last
time the bill was under consideration and
ordered to be printed.
The Chief Clerk read the amendment of
Mr. Ramsey, as follows:
Insert as an additional section :
Sec. â€”. That the Postmastor General is hereby
authorized to cause to be placed to the credit of the
Treasurer of the United States, for the servico of the
Post Office Department, tho net proceeds of the
money-order business; and that the receipts of tho
Post Office Department, derived from this source
during each quarter, shall be entered by the Auditor
of the Treasury for the Post Office Department, in
the accounts of said Department, under the head of
" revenue from money-order business.''
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. RAMSEY. An amendment was pro-
posed by the Senator from California which I
hope will also be adopted.
The Chief Clerk read the amendment pro-
posed by Mr. Casserly, which was at tho end
of the sixth section to insert the following:
And in all cases of regular contracts hereafter
made for a sum exceeding $5,000 per annum tho con-
tract shall, in tho discretion of the Postmaster Gen-
eral, be continued in forco beyond its express terms
for a period not exceeding six months, until a new
contract, with the same or other contractors, shall
be made by the Postmaster General.
Mr. CASSERLY. The word "shall," in
the third line, should read "may," so as to
read "the contract may, in the discretion of
the Postmaster General, be continued in
force," &c.
The VICE PRESIDENT. That modifica-
tion will be made.
Mr. CASSERLY. This should come in at
the end of section five, I find, instead of sec-
tion six.
The VICE PRESIDENT. It will be so
incorporated by the enrolling clerk, at the
end of section five, if the bill should pass and
the amendment be agreed to.
The amendment was agreed to.
The bill was reported to the Senate as amend-
ed, and the amendments were concurred in.
It was ordered that the amendments be en-
grossed and the bill read a third time. The
bill was read the third time, and passed.
bridge at boonville, missouri.
Mr. BLAIR. I move to take up a local
bill, No. 696. It is of great importance to
our people. It provides for a bridge across
the Missouri river at Boonville. It has been
a long time pending, and was reported from
the Committee on Post Offices and Post
Roads well guarded. My colleague and myself
have examined it carefully.
The motion was agreed to; and the Senate,
as in Committee of the Whole, proceeded to
consider the bill (S. No. 696) to authorize the
construction of a bridge across the Missouri
river at Boonville, Missouri.
The first amendment reported by tbe Com-
mittee on Post Offices and Post Roads was to
add to the first section the following:
And to lay on or over said bridge railway-tracks
for the moro perfect connection of any railroads
that are or shall bo constructed to the said river at
or opposite said point, under tho limitations and
conditions hereinafter provided; that said bridge
shall not interfere with tho free navigation of said
river beyond what is necessary in order to carry
into effcct the rights and privileges hereby granted;
and in case of any litigation arising from any ob-
struction, or alleged obstruction, to the free naviga-
tion of said river, the cause may be tried before the
district court of the United States of tbe State of
Missouri in which any portion of said obstruction
or bridge touches.
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. MORTON. I observe that bill only
requires the principal span across the channel
of the river to be two hundred and fifty feet
in length. The bills in regard to the Ohio
river required that the span shall be four hun-
dred and fifty feet.
Mr. BLAIR. 1 will state to the Senator
from Indiana that there are already bridges
constructed on the Missouri river above and
below this bridge with a span of two hundred
and fifty feet; and it was not thought desirable
to compel this company to make wider spans
than the bridge at St. Charles, which is below,
or the bridges at Kansas City, St. Jo., and
Omaha, above. It conforms exactly to the
span required of all the other bridges on the
Missouri river.
Mr. RAMSEY. The great width of span
required on the Ohio river is on account of
the coal-barges. There is no trade of that
kind on the Missouri.
The VICE PRESIDENT. There are other
amendments of the Committee on Post Offices
and Post Roads which will be read.
The Chief Clerk read the next amendment,
which was to strike out the second and third
sections of the hill, as tollows:
Sec. 2. That said bridge shall be a lawful struc-
ture, and shall be recognized and known as a post
route, upon which, also, no higher charge sba.ll bo
made for the transmission over the same of tho
mails, tho troops, and the munitions of war of the
United States than tho rate per mile paid, for the
transportation over the railroad or public highways
leading to the said bridge; aod it shall enjoy tno
rights and privileges of other post roads m t.io
United States. . , ., , , .
Sec. 3. That if the said bndgo shall bo maclo
with unbroken and continuous spans, it shall not bo
of less elevation in any case than fifty loet above
high-water mark, as understood at the point oi
location, to the bottom chord of the bridge nor shall
the spans of said bridge over the mam channel oi
said river be less than two hundred and iilty leot 111
length, and the piers of said bridge shall bp parallel
with the current of tho river; And prooidcd, also,
That if the same shall bo constructed as a draw-
bridge the draw or pivot shall be over tho mam
channel of the river at an accessible navigable Point,
and the spans not less than ono nundred and hlty
feet in length in the clear; and the piers of said
bridge shall bo parallel with the current of the river.
