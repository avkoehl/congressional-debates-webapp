LITTLE ROCK, ARK., July 30, 1864.

Colonel A. H. RYAN,

Lewisburg:

Colonel Geiger telegraphs that his scouts, in from Austin, report Jackman to have passed through that place with 300 men, marching on the Lewisburg road, with the intention of crossing the Arkansas.

C. H. DYER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

LEWISBURG, July 30, 1864.

(Received 7 p. m.)

Captain C. H. DYER,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

If Jackman crosses the Arkansas I think he will do so at Myrick's Mill or Evans' Crossing, both south of the Cadron. I have had scout out in direction of Quitman for several days; will send another to-night, also one to the Cadron. Is it expected of me to take care of the enemy south of the Cadron if threatened by him from the line of Red River?

Respectfully,

A. H RYAN,

Colonel, Commanding.

LITTLE ROCK, ARK., July 30, 1864.

Colonel RYAN,

Lewisburg:

How many men have you, all told? Where are you making you intrenchments? Send drawing of the country, including about five miles square.

By order of Brigadier General E. A. Carr:

C. H. DYER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

LEWISBURG, July 30, 1864-4 p. m.

Captain C. H. DYER,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Dispatch received from one of my female scouts states that McCray is moving up Red River with 1,500 men. I have for duty (cavalry, artillery, and infantry) 1,250 men. The intrenchments are on the inner ridge. I am constructing them so they can be held by a small force of infantry, and with the balance of the command can act on the offensive. I will send you the map the earliest possible moment.

A. H. RYAN,

Colonel, Commanding.

PINE BLUFF, ARK., July 30, 1864.

Captain C. H. DYER,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Dist. of Little Rock:

Yesterday I sent a party of the Thirteenth Illinois Cavalry (fifty men and an officer) to repair the telegraph. They were bushwhacked about ten miles from here to-day on their return. Fifteen men were missing.

POWELL CLAYTON,

Colonel, Commanding.
