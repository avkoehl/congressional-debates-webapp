Thursday, December 5, 1833
Mi GRENNELL submitted a resolution that
the House should, on Monday next, at one o'clock,
proceed to the election of Chaplain, which was
agreed to
KENTUCKY  ELECTION.
Mr HARDIN said hewas induced, in order to
save the time of. the House, and with a view to
place the su j ctm controversy in a more tangible
shape than it was likely from present appearances
it would assume, to submit the following
Resol ed, That the Committee of Elections,
when appointed, inquire and íepoit to th s House
who is the membei elected from the fifth congres
sional distiict.in the State of Ken lucky, and until
the committee shall i epoi t as herein iequued,
RcsoLca That neither Thomas P Moore noi
Robert P Letcher snail be qualified as the mem-
bei from said dis net
ResoUed fail her, That the Committee of Elec-
tions beiequiretl to receive as evidence all the afK
davits and depositions which may have been heie
totoie or which may hereafter be taken by either
of the [ arties, on due noti< e having been given to
the adveise paity,oi his agent, and repoit the
same to the House
Mr   II   sud he lose more for the purpose of
refernrg to the laws of Kentucky, by which he ,
would contend this case muot be governed, than
with any intention to enter at Urge into the dis  i
eu'Mon     He thought that nothing that had been
pieviously said m the course of this debate, in re-
lation to the cases of contested election, in eithei
of the lemtoiies, oi to those which occurred in
New Yoik, had any bearing on the present ques
tion, as i   should be recollected that, by the laws
of  the   several Uni eJ  States,  they  íespectively
made provisions as to the way m which their elec
tion^ should be conducted, both as to time, place,
ard mannei     Here thenonoiable member recited
at latge the piovi«ions of the act regulating elec
tionsm the Statu of Kentucky, and contended that,
as it appealed bj the certificate presented by Mr
Moore., th it all the sheriffs did attend in puisuauce |
of theniode piescrued by law on the fi teenth day
after the  election, for the pur ose of comoaring ,
thevotes 11 then if pectne district ,and yet on y .
three of them h^d signed the eeitfi ate, tnea act
was not in strict confoimity to  the 1 tws of the
State     lie was sure that things would be received j
here as they ait, on broad and hbeial principles
The question was, whethei a certificate of three
fcheufi , lepresenting only part of the district,
should en tule a member toqualify here—the county
of Lincoln, which polled fitteen hundred votes, not
having been taken into the computation Fhere
w ts one preliniirary question to be settled first,
and that was who hat! the cer ficate substantially
in confoimity with the laws of Kentucky ' He
thought ihere was none such He would suppose
a cabe Suppose all the shenffs had attended with
then poll-oooks in hand, and it was previously
known who was elected One of the shenffs is
the friend of the defeated man, he keeps his poll-
book under his arm, and says, " You shall not
cout t my votes, or leain the result on my book,"
and the other slier ffs make out the certificate in
conformity with the result on their books Would
that be such a ceitifiuate as will be accepted here '
He contended that tnis was not a papei ceitifymg
that Mi Mooie was elected, but elected if you
do not count the vote> in one county It was not
a certificate that a man was elected upon counting
all the votes It only certified that in four coun-
ties that ¡Vir Mooie is elected, and even these four
counties certified for by only three shenffs He
hoped, therefoie, that neil^ei gentleman would be
peimitted to qualify until the subject had under-
gone the investigation of a committee, who, having
the poll books before them, could only decide this
case, and do substantial justice by íefeience to
them By adopting this course, both the claim-
ants to the seat should wait the decision of the
committee, they would both be placed alike, and
the subject wou'd be thus dispassionately discussed
and decided fauly upon its merits
Mr ARCHER expressed his surprise at the
doctrine which was broached on this question, that
in order to decide it, it should be decided solely
upon the face of the paper which was presented
by one of the parties Did it not anse to the mind
of those gentlemen who maintained such adoc-
trine, that it was expressly provided foi by the
Constitution that this House was to be the sole
judge of the qualifications of its members ' In his
opinion the case now befoie them was very sim-
ple It was merely to decide upon the sufficiency
of the paper, m order to do which they were to
consider what made it a sufficient paper He
apprehended only two things were necessary to
establish this as making a good return, one was,
that there was in itself sufficient matter, the other,
that it was done by competent authority As to
the first, it was clear, on the face of it, that Mr.
Moore was elected under certain circumstances
that made it appaient it was not a fair return
How, then, could they excuse themselves to their
constituents for making it a matter of debate for
thiee days, to the piejudice of other business'
The paper states that Mi Moore was elected by
a majonty of the qualified votes of the fifth con-
gressional district, the vote of Lincoln county not
taken into calculation This made it not only
insufficient as to matter, but self contiadietory,
and what would he styled, in legal phiase, an
insensible retuin Now, a  to the act being done
by competent authoiity, it appeared to have been
a ceitificate signed by three sheriffs only, who
certify for the majority in favoi of Mr Mooie,
and evidently for four counties He would remark,
in answer to the argument on this point, putforth
by an honoiable membei from New York, [Mr
Beardslb.y,] and whose high eminence in his
profession he would not dispute, that honorable
members, in maintaining that the question was to
be settled solely on the face of ti e certificate, had
argued that,although the numbei of shenffs certi-
fying was less than the whole, yet, the principle
of law applied, that in public bodies the act of a
majonty was the act of the whole number re-
quued by law, and he had asked, in support of
this principle, if one of the sheriffs had died aftei
the election, and had not previousl y cei tified, would
the elec ion have been theief^re destroyed ' He,
(Mi A ,) however, would ask that honoiable
membei to say, what would be the effect in the
case of trustees appointed to peiform a certain
tiust' Would any one trustee be empoweied to
do the acts lequired to be done by two ' Would
there be, on the decease of one of them, any right
devolvingon the remaining trustee in consequence'
And would it not ratner be necessary, in ordei to
execute such (rust, to go to a com t of justice and
have the power conferred in case of eithei death
or refusal on the part of the trustee' He contended
that the certificate wanted all that was necessary to
make it an essential retuin, that as ih  Hause
were then exercising their judicial functions, and
it was, as he thought, fairly stated before in the
debate, if a motion was made m any court of
justice to exclude it as evidence of a fact, it wot Id
be exclude! from its contradictory character. He
m untamed that the House were bound to consider
its imperfectness, and asked, if it was stated that
upon any return made by which a membei claimed
his seat, that such a return was a forgery, would
there be any doubt that they would determine at
once that it was, in consequence, imperfect, and
should not be acted upon' He would not impute
improper conduct m this instance, but would sup-
pose the case of a deputy sheriff, vho, in ordei to
defeat an election, would withhold his pall book
altogether He appealed to the feelings which he
knew peivaded honoiable rmnds as to what would
be then decision
Mr HUBB1RD argued, at some length, to
show that Mr Moore's certificate proved that he-
bad been eleued a Representative from the fifth
congressional district of Ken ucky The s atute
of Kentucky required no more than the statutes of
every State íequneJ The votes, in every State,
were returnable to some tribunal which had the
power to pass judgment on them The returns
read here show conclusively that the claimant did
íeceive the majority of the votes of his distuct.
The provision of the sutute of Kentucky was-
fully complied with The certificate states that
the shenfls of the five counties composing the dis-
trict did assemble and did proceed to tiischaige
and execute the duty imposed upon them by the
provision of jtne act The shenif, certify—what'
That Thomas P Mooie is uuly elected a Rcpre
sei tativeby a majonty of the qual fied votes of the
district We had no knowledge of the fact stated
that the shenffof Lincoln pocketed his poll-book
It does not appear on the lace of the le urn
There might have been reasons for the omission
to leturn the votes of the c >unty of Lincoln
If the sheriffs formed a judicial tribunal for the
purpobe of canvassing the votes, a less numbtr
than the whole body could act He shouldr
propose an amendment to the resolution, in ordei
that the subject should go to the Committee e f
Elections in the usual course of proceeding Not
a single case had ever occurred in which the
House refused to qualify the member actually re-
turned If we went into this sulject witl out the
intervention of a committee we .should have as
muchas would employ us foi some weeks, for
both parties would institute a close scrutiny into
the votes in every county He was very happy
that so much good feeling had bee.i manifested in
this discussion. He had en'ered into it, not in
reference to the controversy between the two indi-
viduals, but because he felt bound to oppose the
innovation attemp ed upon the usages of tina
House He moved to strike out the whole of the
resolu ion offeied by the gentleman fiomKentueky,
and to in«eit the following
"Resolved, That tie certifican presented ty
Thomas P Moore, of his election as a Represent-
ative fiom the fifth congressiotnl dibtnet in Ken-
tueky, furnishes prima jacit evidence of his having
been duly elected, and i hat he is now entitled to
be sworn accoidingly "
Mi HUNTINGTON «aid he should vote
against the amendment, simply because it did not
contain the truth He meant that the assertion
which it contained, that the certificate in question
was evidence of the election of the claimant, was
not supported by the facts of the case Is the ce-i -
tificateduly authenticated accoidtng to the statutes
of Kentucky' And, if it is, is there no other de-
fect in it' The law of Kentucky requnes that the
shenffof each county m the district s ould attach
his signature to the certificate Language could
not be more piecise nor full ihan that of the law
on this point It was not necessaiy to go into ll e
examination of what, under other circumstances,
\\ ould constitute the act of a body, but the gentle-
man from New Yoik, who spoke yesterday, would
not suiely hazatd his piofessional reputation by
maintaining that when the statute, «i expi ess tei ru«,
requires each membei of a body to act, the major-
ity could act for the whole.   Suppose Congress
