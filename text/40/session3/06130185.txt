*It is a noticeable fact that nearly all the officers on duty in the War Department are of the grade of major or still higher.
Longevity rations of Brigadier Generals, heads of departments, stationed at Washington.
Adjutant General's department, Lorenzo Thomas, entered service, 1823, 46 years; 9 rations per day, at 30 cents, $2 70X 365=$985 50 per annum,
bureau ot Military Justice, Joseph Holt, entered service 1862, 7 years? one ration per day, at 30 cents, 365—3100 50 per annum.
Quartermaster general s department, M. C. Meigs, entered service 1836, 33 years; six rations per day, at 30 cents, $1 80X365=S657 per annum.
Commissary of subsistence department, Amos B. Eaton, entered service 1826, 43 years; 8 rations per day, at 30 cents. $2 40 <365=$876 per annum.
Medical department, Joseph K. Barnes, entered service 1840. 29 years; five rations per day, at 30 cent;?. $1 50X365=§547 50 per annum.
Pay department, Benjamin W. Price, entered service 1829, 40 years; 8 rations per day, at 30 cents, $2 40X365=S876 per annum.
Jingineer department, Andrew A. Humphreys, entered service 1831, 38 years; 7 rations per day, at 30 cents, $2 10.%365—§706 50 per annum.
My friend near me says that a lieutenant's
pay is not as much as the clerk of our commit-
tee gets. But the clerk of our committee is a
man of experience in public affairs, who has
been in the service in private and in public till
he has got to be forty-five or fifty yearsof age.
But then as one of these military officers grows
older he grows richer, i. e., he comes to have
more pay. For you will observe the longevity
rations, and the first instance is that of General
Lorenzo Thomas, who has forty-six years of
longevity in the Army, and he gets $935 50
per annum for longevity rations, simply because
he has grown old. Old age is honorable ; let
me say nothing derogatory of that. I only say
that according to Army allowances it is vora-
cious. [Laughter.]
Now, let us see exactly what all these allow-
ances and emoluments, travel and the rest,
make up this pay to be. Let us take General
Thomas's case. His duty has been 'or more
than two years past inspecting grave-yards all
over the country—nothing else—except when
he was Secretary of War ad interim. [Laugh-
ter.] For travel upon this service he gets ten
cents a mile for every mile traveled. I say he
has nothing to do in the world but inspect
grave-yards. Traveling about for that purpose
adds very much to his pay. It will be found
upon examination that we have paid for his
valuable services in the inspecting of ceme-
teries during the past year from twelve to
thirteen thousand dollars, including all emolu-
ments and mileage. He has made more profits
than any other undertaker in the whole country.
[Laughter. ]
Now, gentlemen of the committee, I callyour
attention to these great facts, to this abuse
which has been goingon, isgoing on, and which
will go on unless we interfere to stop it. Quite
one half of these officers, with their very great
pay, are supernumerary. Therefore I have
endeavored to bring in an amendment, which,
among other things, should cut off those that
are not necessary to the service of the country.
The better way to examine the subject further,
after taking these general views of the pay of
Ihe officers of the Army, will be to take the
bill section by section.
The first section provides that the grade of
General of the Army shall cease on the 4th of
March next. The bill of the committee agrees
to that ; the bill of last year reported from the
committee agreed to that, and this House
ordered it.
The next provision is that the office of Lieu-
tenant General of the Army shall remain uutil
there is a vacancy, and no longer. Both the
commmittee and the House agree to that also.
The next provision, and it is a very vital one,
is that brevet rank shall give no precedence of
rank or pay. but shall be honorary only, and
hereafter shall not be conferred except in time
of war for gallaut and meritorious services in
the field. Why, there are men who have stopped
in Washington with quills behind their ears
until they have worn out the cushions they sat
upon during the war, and who never left the
soft cushions in their offices, and yet they are
breveted as high as brevet major general. So
that it has got to be an honorary distinction
rather in the Army not to have had a brevet.
This amendment takes away all pay and pre-
cedence from brevet rank, leaving it honorary
merely.
The next section provides that after the 1st
day of July, 1869, there shall be only three
major generals. We have five now. How many
had we before the war? One. Major General
"Winfielu Scott was a full major general; he was
brevet lieutenant general; and General Wool
was only brevet major general. Now, if before
the war we could get along with one major gen-
eral certainly we could get along now with one
Lieutenant General and three major generals.
The next section provides that there shall
be only six brigadier generals, one of them to
be chief of the staff of the Army, leaving five
general officers of that rank. All these are to
be selected by the President after the 4th of
March from the present officers of those ranks
without regard to seniority, so that we may
have the best men.
The next section provides—and that is ex-
actly what the House voted when this matter
was up before—that the offices of Adjutant
General, Quartermaster General, Commissary
General of Subsistence, Chief of Ordnance,
Chief of Engineers, Paymaster General, Sur-
geon General, and Judge Advocate General
shall be filled by appointment or detail from
the rank of colonel only.
Before the war, Mr. Chairman, we had but
one brigadier staff general, and we had but
one man at the head of a staff department
who was a graduate of West Point. Now
we have got every staff department filled with
brigadier generals with full rank and pay. And
we do not stop there, my friends; we have
got that anomaly in all the services on earth,
a brigadier general of marines who goes on
horseback, I suppose, at the head of the horse-
marines! [Laughter.] No marine corps ever
is got together in a brigade or ever was meant
for a brigade. What are marines used for?
They are to put a company here and a com-
pany there on board ship. What was the
original intent of marines? They were origin-
ally designed in the British service when they
pressed their crews and got on board men that
they could not trust to be an armed force to
keep order and to stand between the officers
and the crew. That was the original intention
of marines. We need only a company or a
part of a company on board ship. When are
they ever brigaded? Why are we supporting
a man in the position of a brigadier general of
marines at a salary of eight thousand or more
a year—more than the Speaker of this House
gets? And when we of the Committee of Ap-
propriations wanted to cut it off we were met
by a point of order, and the matter went to the
Naval Committee.
Mr. O'NEILL. I wish to say to the gentle-
man—perhaps he does not recollect it—that
there was a large force of marines in the Mex-
ican war, six or seven hundred of them, if I
mistake not, commanded by the present briga-
dier general, then Major Zeilin. There was
also a large battalion of them in the first battle
ofBull Run—somefour orfive hundred—which
battalion did great service on that disastrous
field. Many of them were killed, and many
of the officers and men to-day bear honorable
wounds which they received on that day.
Mr. BUTLER, of Massachusetts. I agree
to that. I agree that the largest force of tau-
rines ever got together was commanded by a
major. [Laughter.] What has that to do with
having a brigadier general to command them?
