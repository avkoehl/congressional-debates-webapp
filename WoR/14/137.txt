MAY 4, 1862.

Com. SMITH, Commanding Fleet:

I learn that a large part of the rebel force marched to Bigler's Mill, on the York River, last night, to take sail from there to West Point. It is of the first important to my operations that some of your gunboats hurry up to West Point to destroy the transportation and report to me the state of affairs.

Franklin's division will be ready to go up under convoy of the other gunboats as soon as I can hear from the river.

GEO. B. McCLELLAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
