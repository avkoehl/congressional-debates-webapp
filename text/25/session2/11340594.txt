©vftiy obiect of trafile to the value of the precious iw tais, but
does not require tliat these metals shall be the actual commuta
tionin every transaction of trade The convenience of society
fe is umloi mly madpthe equivalent of coin, m the great attairs
of tiade, moroacceptabl© than the com it*elf, and com now la no
longer neces-iaiyas a commutation for bank paper, than asna
presence is requisite to piemen e the standard of value in the pa
pel What is tne latto of com necessary fortius purpose, i& a
pioblemthtt will < vei be vaiymg in its terms It is vet y obvious
t lat, if every holder of bank paper insist upon ha-* in£ the coin
at any given moment, the richest bank may be compelled to
ab Midori business if the public be content not to demand it
it is equally cleai thaf a \ery small portion of com need be
kept on hand We mii't not confound ultimate solvency wiih
thid question of cenvei ability Banks, no more than private
individuals are affected in ttteu actual solvency by not having
coin at hand, although the effects of not paying m com when
req med are very different m the two cases, the bank would
be discredited for want of punctuality, the individual would
tbcipe almost without comment It is, therefore, the peculiar
duty oí banks to keeL a poition of their funds in hard money,
sufficient to jeleem so much of their circulation as may be
demanded H they kepi an amount equal to their circulation,
they would lo e the legitim ue profit of their business, if they
Kept less than might be demanded of them, they run the risk of
losing then cíe lit They muv a^ceitain the safe medium be
tween the<je two extiernes What is that medium can never
be so accuiately deteimined by any authority as Ly the banks
themselve It is a question whuh will depend upon the state
of public c mfilence, and that confidence must from its natute,
1 eaifeUel by the eiicumatinces or eventsof the day No de
gieeot prudence, not no amount of wealth, would suffice to
BdA e a bmk ft o n bping drained of i s com if the whole ffmniu
nuy weie determined to set upon it with a demand for com
fcven i! thespe-10 in its possession exceed the cnculation, the
bank may sail be exhausted, provided it be determined to con
tmue its busmen and to maintain that circulation at a fixed
amount A hundiel dollar note paid out on discount to rlay
may be returned with a demand for specie to morrow, if it be
ruasne I in another discount, m pursuance of the purpose to
keep up thecitculation, it may again return lodraw Us amount
m specie and through a continuation of this process the same
note may take >ut of the vault ten timet; it<i own amount of coin
Again, sn, th hiflati m will be affected by the conditio  of the
community m which it exists An active thriving bnsiness

celerity as to give it íenewed confidence m us progress In
s uch a state of things a given amount of paper perloi ms dou
Me treble, peihaps tenfold woik in the way of exchmge^,
whilst m a sluggish tommunitv, of amongst a widely scattered
population, the cnculation, hem up meie slowness oí its
movement requites a broadei basis of specie
Í efer Mr ( han man very cursouly to these considerate s
lo bhowhow futile must be the endeavor to regulate the rela
it m of specie to paper by am fijied and unvarying Iiw, how
still moie absurl it mufit be to make this a subject of Govern
in>nt action
1 have taken some pains, sir, to ascertain what has, in /act,
leen this relation in our own country for several veara |¡ ast
That mquny his affotded me the following results Trom the
yeai 1530, the return" to the Government, upon th s subject,
h-ive been full, an 1,1 believe,accurate I hey will show that
from that period down to the present year, 1838, the aggregate
specie in dll the banks ha-* aveiageda ratio of between one
third and one fourth id the circulation, in 3830 the circulation
w s a frarri m h ss than three of papei to one of specia in the
banks, in IS-Í7 te-,n than four to one
Dividing tht states into sections, with leference to the na

and of the success of his humb e efforts to restore a sound tur

rather ab ive five dollars of paper for one of spec le hi the banks

The Bmfc of France suspended specie payinenti in 1-806, for
about four months, yet Prance has upwards of s, x hundred mil
lions ofdollarb in her specie currency The bank issues no note
oí less denomination than five hundred francs, equal to one
iiWidred dollars, and haa always sustained a very high credit
I have urotight the„e facts into view, Mr Chairn an, stilt fui
tiier to demonstrate the natural, the insuperable difficulty of a
fixed ratio, and ilsotoshow how little the solvency of a bank
depends upon the amount of specie which it may have on hand
It belongs to the ciedit system, in whatever manner that svstem
may be constructed, tobe subject to occasional variations in its ,
relation to the meta'Iicbasisoi the countiy, and no care oí the
Government can possibly remove the causes which may affect
that relation The ü ue principle by which it is controlled is
th t which is suggested fay the demands of tradeand the amount
of foieign debt— m other word«, by the state of foieSn ex*
change A demmd for specie abroad will necessarily infiutíiice
this it latían at home The precious metals will pei form then
office m the licju datum of that demand, in spite of all the care
of Government, and whilst they are so emplo>ed, thetnlj eait
guard which the domestic cunency can resort to is thatpiudcnt
economy in the concerns of trade which the private ju Igment
ofevcry man s-uggests lohim in his individuil concerns ,vben.
his affairs have been deranged by atoo prodigal expendituitof
his means
Ours, sn, is essentially a credit system, gauged by gold and
silver To whatever disorders it may be incident, it is still tlwt
to which we owe our rapid advance to national prosperity, and
we will nevei pait with it for any piomisc of good fitfm the
hard money scheme We have been educated in the peicep
tion of ir<* value it is domesticated m oui homes furnishes om
ordinary implements in the thrift of ld>, and his become cons 
nationally parcel oí ourselves Whatevei may be its defects,
we take it with them, mpieferenceto any substitute If it has its
flucuntions, so has the puie metallic currency, not less huitful
than those ol paper The lecumulauon of a fortign debt
woul 1, wiih that cuneocy a« with any other, carry away the
pieci ms metals, and'hus nifit-the vilueof ad that weie left
behind If i merchant imp >rt gold when the countiy is in want
oí hardware oi cloth, gold will grow to We redundant andcheip,
whilst hud ware and rloh will become dear A faikne ofa
ciop anv stint the supply of credits abroad, a foie an subsidy
mi> take away a poitum ol your coin, everv cause which ope
iatet> m tfais lomi, will change puces relatively to the pre
cious metalb, as they chansre them in reference to good papei
It is commeice and mdustiy and enierpuse that produce these
fluctuations,a very smallshaie of the evil is otuinanly tobe
ascribed to the nature of the currency
In reference to this question of the latio, it is proper to inquire
a little more into then iture of what is tcin ed the currency It
has been often contended here that the Constitution allows no
currency but gold and sil\ er Sir, the Constitution mak< s no
reference to cunency at ill It supplies, as I have sftid before,
the standard for all val uts, and that is all that it pi )ie«ses to do
It was manilestly so understood by us founders when General
Hamilton, in the first year of General Washington's adminMi a
tion, issued his Treu.uiy order to receive iwnk papei, an 1
when, in one ytar alterwaid^ (l791)Congiessratified thai m-dci
by positive bgislation The currency of the country, n die
aspect ofit winch I propose to present, mcludesthat whole mass
ol fia pei credits which aie useJ m commeicial dealings for the
discharge or tiaRtfer of debt It embiaces promts >i> i oles
bills of exchange, dianghN, checks, in 1 other cvidencet- >! m
debtednesa All oí the^e, sir, by thttheoiy of ourCoiihtiiutwn,
are as much payable in emu a& the notes of a bank Tht y all
piofet>s to be (onvertible or redeemable paper, yet no md vidual
ever thinks it his duty to keep gold or silver at hand tr meet
such enüagements If com be demanded, his resource i the
bank so that, through this process, the hanks may be sai! to be
under an ob'igation to pi o vide for the convertibility of all this
amount of paper Cump ire the specie retained bv the hanss
with the sum ol ail these enga«rmenta, md it will be seen that
the ratio i" not one t< uh—peihaps not a twentieth—and ye* it is
amply sufficient In LngUnd, since the passage of the 1 iw

the Bank n^eif, th directc is have ewdeivored to establish the
rule of keeping one thud of the amount of their cuctldUon and
deposites in bullion They have not been very succe «fui in
this endeavoi That Bink now virtually supplies the torn of
the three kingdoms and upon a b i«ib of aoout tt n millions s er

Sir, I would not have tioubled the committee with this umn
viting detail of money statistics, if I were not awive that uj «n
tin--subject many euors of opinion have obtained credit with
thecoo'itry during the 1 a it eight yeais—errois v.hich I think
m t; be distinctly traced to tie sedulous efforts made bv the
last A Iministranon t< persuade the people than ?n increased
supply of the pieci uis nieta's was essential to the «afety of oui
cuuency aid that the Goveinn ent itself without rcsptct to f be

might compel their import ilion from loieign countries This
opinion, eni reed with all the ofnuil author ty rf the Exem
