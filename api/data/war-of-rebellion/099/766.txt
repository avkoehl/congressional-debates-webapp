(Received 13th.)

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

The enemy made a heavy attack upon our center and left to-day, but was decisively repulsed and with heavy loss. His dead and badly wounded men left upon the field. We also took several hundred risoners. Our loss is small. General Couch is only twelve miles from here to-night, and will be up early in the morning. We took prisoners from Lee's and Stewart's corps. They say two corps are here, and the rest of Johnston's are coming.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.
