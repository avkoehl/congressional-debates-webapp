180. Report of Colonel D. H. Hamilton, First South Carolina Infantry, of operations August 29-September 2.

SEPTEMBER 30, 1862.

CAPTAIN: In obedience to orders from Brigadier-General Gregg, received this date, I herewith beg leave to hand in my report of the part taken by the Twelfth Regiment South Carolina Volunteers in the battles of Manassas, August 29 and 30; battle of Ox Hill, September 1; the capture of Harper's Ferry; the battles of Sharpsburg and Shepherdstown, or Boteler's Ford:

I was not present with my regiment in the three first-named battles, being on sick leave, in consequence of a severe and protracted illness, contracted by exposure and fatigue in the battle of June 26, 27, and 30, and July 1, around Richmond; consequently my report of the battles of August 29 and 30 must be prepared from the reports of company officers, there being no field officer at present with the regiment who was on duty with the regiment at that time. I therefore have the honor to submit the report as taken from Captain W. P. Shooter, Company E, First Regiment South Carolina Volunteers:
