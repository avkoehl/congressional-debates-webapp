THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

melter and refiner, chief coiner and engraver, assist-
antassayer, and sevui clerks, $36,500,
For wases of workmen and ttdjutters, 6125,000.
For incidental and contingent expenses, $25,000.
Mr. H1GBY. I move to amend the clause
in relation to "incidental and contingent ex-
penses" by striking out "$25,000" and insert-
ing$10,000." 1 do this for the purpose of
inquiring why $15,000 more is appropriated in
this bill than was appropriated last year. I
ltnow nothing about it; but by referring to the
law of last year I find there was appropriated
only $10,000.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. The rea-
son is that there have been extended repairs
and new machinery, which make the addi-
tional appropriation necessary.
Mr. HIGBY. I withdraw the amendment.
The Clerk resumed the reading of the bill.
The following paragraphs were read:
Branch mint at San Francisco, California:
Fur salaiiesof superintendent, troasuier. assayer,
melter and refiner, coiner, and six clerks, ^30,500.
For wages of workmen and adj usters, $100,000.
Mr. HIGBY. I move to amend the clause
relatingto "workmen and adjusters" bystrik-
ingout " $100,000" and inserting " $101,450."
I find that the amount appropriated last year
was $205,450. The amount of coinage in that
mint for the last year was a little more than for
the j'ear before, a little over nineteen millions.
The estimates that come from the Treasury
Department ask for the amount I have named
in my amendment. 1 know of no reason why
this mint should not bo kept in operation. 1
find that the Mint at Philadelphia coined about
twelve millions, or a little less than seven mil-
lions difference between the two.
Now, it may be possible that the Committee
on Appropriations can explain why they have j
made this wonderful reduction upontheappro-
priation of last year. I know of no reason
why there should be this vast amount taken oil'
the sum appropriated last year.
By reference to the estimates that come from
the Treasury Department 1 find this item:
For superintendent and treasurer, assayer, melter
fend refiner and coiner and six clerks, 830,500.
That amount is reported in this bill by the
Committee on Appropriations. Then there is
this item in the estimates :
For wages of workmen and adjusters, §10! ,450.
The amount appropriated last year for work-
men and adjusters was $205,450. I have
moved to increase the amount here reported
$100,000, to $101,450, as called for by the es-
timate sent in from the Treasury Department.
Mr. WASHBUllNB, of Illinois. Mr. Chair-
man, I will explain why the Committee on
Appropriations cut down the appropriations
for'this branch mint at San Francisco. They
found, by referring back for a number of years,
that the expenditures of this mint had been
extravagant to the last, degree, and that it was
unnecessary to appropriate for that mint any
larger sum than we propose to appropriate in
this bill. We appropriate all that is necessary
to pay the salaries of all the officers. The
only question is in regard to the payment of
wages for workmen, adjusters, &c. We pro-
pose an appropriation of §100,000. Last year
$205,450 were appropriated for the same pur-
pose for the present fiscal year; and the esti-
mate for the nest fiscal year was $101,450.
Now, sir. I desire to call the attention of
the committee to a table showing the expense
ofthe mint at San Francisco as compared with
the expense of the Mint at Philadelphia. By
this table it appears that in 1865 the value of
the gold coined at the branch mint at San
Francisco was $19,144,875 58, the number of
pieces coined (which really shows the amount
of work done) being 1,775,116. ^ hat do you
suppose, Mr. Chairman, was the expense- of
that mint for that year ? It was $550,513 07.
Let us look at the expenses of the Mint at Phil-
adelphia, the parent Mint, for the same year.
The number of pieccs coined was 85,548.73o,
and the expense was only $250,000—just about
one half. We considered this discrepancy most
alarming, and one that could not be justified.
We believe that the amount which we propose
to appropriate in this bill will be sufficient to
carry on the operations at that mint to the
fullest extent if it is managed with honesty
and economy, as i hope and believe it will be
if we put this limit upon the expenditure. Let
me refer again to the facts exhibited by the
table I have mentioned.
In 1862 the expense of coining 2,345,OOOpieces
at the branch mint at San Francisco was but
$275,556 37 ; but in 1865 the expense of coin-
ing only 1,775,116 pieces reached the enormous
sum of $550,513 07. And that, too, with less
earnings. Besides, they expend in addition to
the amount appropriated what they call'' avail-
able profits;" that is, the amount the mint
charges for parting, refining, and toughening
the metals. From these statements the com-
mittee will understand why w.e believed that
the expenses of this mint at San Francisco
should properly be limited to (he amount named
in the bill. 1 submit, for the information of
the committee, the statement to which 1 have
referred, exhibiting the comparative expenses
ol'tlie mint at San Francisco and that at Phila-
delphia :

Mr. IIIGBY. Mr. Chairman, I withdraw my
previous am en dment, and move anoth er to make
the amount of the appropriation $191,400. It
is very easy, sir, to make charges of great "ex-
travagance," 5'c. : but the gentleman from
Illinois [Sir. Washbirne] should bea in mind
that during the year 1865, to which he has re-
ferred, all the expenses of the employes at
tlie San Francisco mint had to be paid1 in gold.
Everything they bought they bought with gold.
Everything done in that establishment was done
on the gold basis, because the State of Cali-
fornia recognized no other circulating medium
than gold. Let me state a fact for the inform-
ation of the House. When I went to my
State in 1865 I sold currency for forty cents
on the dollar; and the articles and commod-
ities generally cost at that time as much there
in gold as they cost here in paper.
Sir, the apparently large expenditures at the
mint at San Francisco were not owing to the
extravagance ofthe individuals who carried on
that mint, but to the circumstances in which
we were then placed as a nation.
Mr. UPSON. Do those circumstances exist
now?
Mr. HFGBY. No; and the expenses of con-
ducting that establishmant have been reduced
nearly or quite one half. Last year the ex-
penses were reduced nearly forty thousand
dollars on account of the diminished difference
between paper and gold as compared with pre-
vious years. But let me state, for the informa-
tion of gentlemen, that there is now as great a
difference, if not a greater difference, between
currency and gold as there was last year. I
think the difference is a little more at this time
than it was last year. This, Mr. Chairman,
explains, I think, the wonderful "extravagance
and dishonesty" which, as the gentleman from
Illinois thinks, have been exhibited in the man-
agement of that mint at San Francisco.
1 am well aware where the gentleman gets
a large portion of his information. I under-
stand all about that. 1 have an authority
which is paramount to the source from which
he quotes his information, and that is the Sec-
retary of the Treasury. I have read to the
House already the estimates as they come in
from the Secretary of the Treasury. , The
superintendent himself puts the estimates at a
lower amount than they were the year before,
very little, however—about three thousand dol-
lars. The Secretary of the Treasury estimates
as the amount necessary to carry on this mint
for the ensuing year the amount appropriated
in this bill. Next is $191,450, the amount I
asked for in the ameudment I submitted. This
comes from the Secretary of the Treasury.
Yet the Committee on Appropriations tell as
there is a wonderful dishonesty in the extrava-
gance with which they have carried on that
mint. If the gentleman understood how I have
had to make up what I get here whe/i I reach
the other coast he would not make such re-
marks as those he has made in respect to this
institution. 1 know that there was complaint
during the Thirty-Ninth Congress on the part
of many of the employ6s in that mint that they
could not live on the salary they received.
Why? Because the difference between gold
and paper was so great that when they camo
to reduce their pay to a gold basis it would
not support them. It was such considerations
that induced the Department to send us the
estimates as we have them.
I should like the gentleman to explain how
he makes out there is extravagance of expend-
iture in that mint? I should like him to ex-
plain to us why it is this committee put this
Mint at Philadelphia, which did not coin so
much last year, at a higher rate than that at
San Francisco. There is a little inconsistency
about that, and I should like to have some ex-
planation of it. I presume it is all right enough
about the estimates for the Mint at Philadel-
phia. I want to know why the mint at San
Francisco, the only place for coinage upon the
Pacific coast, is the only one that is struck at
by the committee.
[Here the hammer fell.]
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. The state-
ments I have made to the committee I believe
to be entirely correct, and I do not know the
gentleman from California has challenged any
one of them. If he does I ask the Clerk to read
a letter from Colonel Taylor, the Comptroller
