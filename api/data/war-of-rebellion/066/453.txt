RICHMOND, VA., April 27, 1864.

S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General.

CHARLESTON, S. C., April 27, 1864.

General SAMUEL COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General, Richmond, Va.:

Your telegram of this date regarding movements of troops from Savannah received. The orders for their movement were given without delay. Your change of orders for the Sixty-third and Sixty-fourth Georgia Regiments occasioned some delay, as the latter had not returned from Florida. Another delay has been caused by the obligation of the South Carolina Railroad to deliver a certain amount of corn in Richmond per day, and I have not though proper go give any order which would interfere with compliance with that obligation. The transportation of prisoners to the South has also caused delay in transportation of troops.

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.

CHARLESTON, S. C., April 27, 1864.

To Officer Commanding Colquitt's Brigade,

En route to Wilmington, Florence, S. C.:

Return with your command to Charleston as soon as possible; another brigade is going in your stead.
