omission or commission on our part I denve,
therefne, the highest satisfaction from being able
to issure you, that the whole couise of this Gov
einment lias been chaiactenzcd by a spmt so
conciliatory and foibeanng, as to make ltimpos
¡bible that our justice and modulation should be
questioned, whatever may be the consequences
ofa longei perseveiance, on the paitof the French
Government, in hei omission to satisfy the con-
ceded claims of our citizens
The histoi y of the accumulated and unprovoked
aggressions upon our commerce, committed by
authonty ot the existing Governments of Fiance,
between the yeais 1800 and 1817, has been ren-
deied too painfully familai to Americans to make
its repetition eithei necessaiyor desirable It
will be sufficient here to remaik, that there has,
for many years, been scaicely a single adminis-
tration of the French Government by whom the
justice and legality of the claims of oui citizens
to indemnity weie not, to a veiy considerable
extent, admitted, and vet neai a quarter of a cen
tiny has been wasted in ineffectual negotiations
to secuie it
Deeply sensible of the injurious effects íesult-
mg from this state of things upon  the interests   i
and chaiacter of both  nations, I íegarded it as
among mv fiist duties to cause one more effort I
to be made to satisfy Fiance, that a just and
liberal settlement of our cKims was as well due
to hei own honoi as to then incontestable valid   ¡¡
lty      1 lie negotiation for this purpose was com   '
menced with the late Government of Fiance, and  |
was prosecuted with such success, as to 1 a\e no
r< abonable giound to doubt, that a settlement of
a chaiactei   quite as  libeial as that wInch "was
subsequently made   would   ha/e  been   effected,
had not the revolution, by which the negotiation
was cut off, taken place     The discussions weie
lesumed with the present Government,   uid the
lesnlt showed, tint we weie notwiong in sup
posing, that an event by which the two Govern
mi nts w ere made to appi oach each othei so mu h
neaiei in then political pnnciples, and by vvl ich  i
thi motives foi the most liberal and fncndly mtei
course were so gicatlymultiphed, could cxcicise  i
no othei tnan a salut uy influe ncc upon tne ue
gotiation     Aftci  the most dchbei-uc and thoi    i

signed at Pans on the 4th of July, 1831, by which
it was stipulate d that " tin. Fipnch Government,

which Fiance has igrecd to pey, mteiest theie-

were seemed to Fi nn e by the following ai tick ,
viz "Th wines of 1 lance, fiom and aftci
tin exchange of the i animations ol the piesert
convention, shall be admitted to consumption
in the States of the U non, at duties which shall
not exceed the following rates by the gallon,
(such as is used at'piesentfor wines m the United
States,) to wit six cents for red wines in casks
ten cents for white wines in casks, and twenty
two cents for wines of all sorts in bottles The
proportions existing between the duties on French
wines thus íeduced, and the general rates of the
tariff which went into opeiation on the first of
Januaiy, 1829, shall be maintained, in case the
Government of the United States should think
proper to diminish those geneial rates in a ne.v
tariff "                                                                           |
In consideration of this stipulation, which shall
be binding on the Umti d States for ten yeais, the
Fiench Government abandons the reclamations
which it had foimedm i elation to the eighth article
of the treaty of cession of Louisiana it engages, I
moieovei, to establish on the "longstaple cottons
of the United States, which, after the exchange
of the ratifications of the piesent convention,
shall be biought dnectly thence to Fiance by
the vessels of the United States, or by Tienen ¡
vessels, the same duties as on shoit staple cottons "
This treaty was duly latified m the mannei |
presenbed by the constitutions of both countries,
and the latification w as exchange d at the city of
Washington on the 2d of Feoruary, 1832 On I
account of its commeicial stipulations it was, in j
five days thereaftei, laid befoie the Congress of'
the United States, which pioceeded to enact such
laws fav orable to the commeice of Fiance as were
neeissaiy to cany it into full execution, and
Fiance has, fiom that period to the piesent, been |
in the unicstnctcd enjoyment of the valu ible
piiVileges that were theis seceucd to her The
faith ot the French nation having been thus sol-
emnly pkdged, thiough its onstitutional oigan,

long defened chums uf oui citizens, as also for
the adjustment ot othei points of gieat and íe
cipiocil bem fits to bothcountn s, and the United

to c ui v the tieaty into full and fan effect on then
put, counted, with the most perfect confluence,
on equal fid hty and piomptitude on the pait of
the I ícnch Government In this icasoiiable ex
pi ct tion we hive bien, Iiegutto infoim vou,
wholly disappointed No legislative piovision
has been made by France for 'he t xecution of the
tie lty, either as it lespects the indemnity to be
paid, oi the commeicial benefits to be secuicd to
the United States, and the relations between the
United States and that Povvei, m consequence
theicof, aie placed in a situation thieatening to
intcriupt the good und i standing which has so
ling and so happily existed between the two
nvtxons
Not only has the Tienen. Gov einment been thus
wanting in the peifoimance of the stipulations it
has so solemnly entered into with the Lnittd
States, but us omissions have been maiked by en
cumstjncLs which would seem to leave us with
out satisfaetoi v evidence^, that such perfoinitnee
will ceitamly take place at a futuie peuod Advice

Chamber weie then sitang, and con mued in

one nistillment of the indemnity was ptyablc on
the 2d of Febiuaiy, ISW, on< veai aftci the ex

to the Chambeis foi the lequued appiopnation

of jNovembci, 1832, and contin led until the 2ath
of April, 1833 ^Notwithstanding the omission
to pay the fust installment had been mtde th
subj ct of earnest lemoostranee on oui pait, tin

the necessaiy appiopnation  to execute it, weie
not laid befoie the Chambei of Deputies until the
5th of Apnl,neaily five months aftei its meeting,
and only nineteen days b foie the close ol the
session     The  bill was  lead and  lefeircd to  a
committee, but there was no fuither action upon
it   The next session of the Chambers commenced
on the 26th of April, 1833, and continued until
the 26th of June following      A new bill was
mtioduced on the 11th of June, but nothing im-
portant  was  done  in  relation  to it during the
session     In the month of April, 1834, neaily
thiee yeais after the signatuie of the treaty, the
final action of the French Chambers upon the bill
¡l to cairy the tieaty into effect was obtained, and
i| resulted in a refusal of the necessaiy appiopri-
i atmns    The avowed giounds upon which the
j  bill was rejected are to be found in the published
|  debates of that body, and no observations of mine
j can be necessary to satisfy Congiess of then uttei
I insufficiency     Although the gross amount of the
claims of our citizens is piobably greater than
will be ultimately allowed by the commissioners,
sufficient is, nevertheless, shown, to   render   it
absolutely cei tain that the indemnity falls fai short
of the actual amount of our just claims, inde-
pendently of the question of damages and mteiest
foi the detention     That the settlement involved
a saenfice in this íesptct was well known at the
time—a saenfice which was clieei fully acquiesced
in by the diffcient blanches of the Fedeial Gov-
ernment, whose action upon the tieaty was re
quired, fiom a sincere desire to avoid fuither col-
lision upon this old and disturbing subject, and
in  the  confident  expectation  that the geneial
relations between the two countries would be ím-
pioved thereby
The refusal to vote the appropriation, the news
of which was íeceivedfiom oui Minister in Pans
about the 15th day of Mav last, might have been
considered the fin ü deteimn aaon of the Fiench
Government not to execute the stipulations of
the tieety,and would have justified an immediate
communication of the facts to Congiess, with a
lpoommenelation of such eiltimate measures as
the interest and honoi of the United States might
seem to lequne But with the news of the refusal
of the Chambei s to make the appiopnation, weie
conveyed the íegrets of the King, and a declara-
tion that a national vessel should be foithvvith
sent out with instiuctions to the Fiench Minister
I to give the most ample explanations of the past,
| and the strongest assurances foi the future After
a long passage, the piomised dispatch vessel
arnved The pledges given by the French Min-
lstei, upon receipt of his mstiuctions, were, that,
as soon after the election of the new membeis as
the ch trier would peimit, the Legislative Cham
beis of France should be called togethei, and the
proposition for an appiopnation laid befoie them,
! that all the constitutional powers of the King and
I his Ctbinet should be excited to accomplish the
object, and th it the re suit should be made known
eaily enough to be communicated to Congiess at
the commencement of the piesent session Re-
lying upon these pledges, and not doubting that
the acknowledged justice of oui claims, the
piomised exertions of the King uid his Cabinet,
and, above all, tint sicred íegardfoi the national
futh mil honoi for winch the Fiench chaiacter
h s been so distinguished, would secuie an eaily
execution of the tieaty in ill its parts, I did not
deem it necessaiy to call the attention of Con-
giess to the sub] et U the list session
I legiet to sav that the pledges made through
the Ministei of Fiance have not been redeemed
The new Chimbéis met on the 31st July list,and
although the subjc ct of fulfillu " treaties was al-
luded to in the speech f loin 'he 1 hi one, no attempt
was mode by the King oi his Cabinet to piocure
an appiopmtion to cany it into execution The
leasons given foi this omission, although they
might be considuedsufiicic nt in an ordinal y case,
ai "not tons stent with the expectations founded
upon the cissiudiiees given heie, foi there is no
constitutii nal obstacle to entenng into legislative
business at the fi t m eting of the Chambeis
This pom , how ever, might have been overlooked,
had not the Chambeis instead of being called to
meet at so eaily a day that the lesult of their de-
hbei itions might be communicated to me befoie
the me ear g of Congress, been piorogued to the
29th of the piesent month—a period so late that
then decision cm scaicely be made known to the
piesent Consiess pnoi to its dissolution To

of the assuiauee given by the French Ministei m
