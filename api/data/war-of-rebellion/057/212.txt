18 miles, and on reaching Chunky's Station to go north to the corral and relieve Chambers' brigade, which would then come forward. The other two brigades of Leggett's division (Force's and Maltby's) were employed tearing up the railroads and destroying Government buildings.

February 20, at 7 a. m., commenced our return march via Decatur, Hillsborough, Canton, and Brownsville, crossed Pearl River at Ratliff's Ferry, on a temporary bridge constructed by the pioneer corps of the Third and Fourth Divisions and Chambers' brigade, and reached Canton on the evening of the 26th, without any molestation from the enemy.

March 1, left Canton, the rear guard marching out about 4 p. m., and bivouacked about 5 miles west on the Livingston road. Two days before leaving Canton two brigades of the enemy's cavalry came up, and as we moved out of the town made demonstrations on our rear guard, but with trifling effect. They continued to harass our rear, and make slight demonstrations on our flanks until we passed Brownsville, always keeping, however, at a respectful distance from the infantry.

March 4, command crossed Big Black on our return, and resumed its original positions.
