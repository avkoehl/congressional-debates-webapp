DEAR SIR: My time has been so much taken up with the ate important arrests in this city that it has been impossible as yet to make any detiled statmeents as to the several parties arrested. I have had a long conversation to- day with MJames M. Haig. He has given me the names of a large number of persons in Blatimore, Philadelphia and New York who are engaged in purachesing and forwarding cotraband goods on alarge scale. Some of these peersons ae filling contracts at this time for our Government. There was a company formed composed of leading baqnkers and merchants for the purchase of $300,000 worth of goods. The steamer is purchased and was to clear for Claifornia
