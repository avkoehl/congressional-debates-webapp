HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS, January 3, 1865-7.40 p. m.

General S. WILLIAMS,Assistant Adjutant-General:

Our quartermaster reports that 8,000 pounds of grain were furnished last night to the person sent from the cavalry to receive it. He was to return this morning for the balance ordered to be furnished. Requisitions were made upon all the quartermasters in the corps to furnish their proportion. The party has not been here to-day for the grain. Orders are made out for the delivery to the cavalry of 80,000 pounds of grain. The supply in the corps is short, as the chief quartermaster states he has not been able to draw any grain for four days. General Crawford not being present, I have the honor to report as above.
