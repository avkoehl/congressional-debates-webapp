The question was taken on the amendment of
Mr. Gwra, and it was rejected
Mr. COOPER of Georgia then moved, as a com-
promise, to fix the duty at 24 cents per square
yard.
Mr. POPE having made a few remark , the
amendment to the amendment was negatived.
Mr. COOPER then proposed to amend, by sub-
stituting an ad valorem duly for the duty per yard.
Mr. CARY and Mr. GAMBLE having made
some remarks—
Mr COOPER withdrew his amendment.
Mr J CAMPBELL proposed to st-ike out 3,
and insert 2$ cents per yard
This was debated by Mr J CAMPBELL, Mr.
POPE, and Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi, and
the amendment was then negatived.
Mr. THOMPSON proposed to change the duty
to one of 21 per cent, ad valorem; which was neg-
atived.
Mr. HABERSHAM moved, pro forma, to strike
out 3_r, and insert 22i per cent —his object being
to obtain an opportunity to make a few observa-
tions; and then he withdrew his amendment.
The question recurred on the proposition to
strike out 5, and insert 3J, which was negatived.
The fourth clause of the 3d section being under
consideration—
Mr. W. W. IRWIN proposed to strike out 35,

ed, printed, or painted floor oil cloth, 35 cents per
square yard." He said it was an ai íüe of luxury
that was manufactured in ibis couutry
Mr. FILLMORE said the proposed duty would
be prohibitory.
The amendment was negatived
Mr. SALTONSTALL proposed to reduce the
duty from 25 to S per cent, on Chinese or other
floor matting, &c.
Mr. FILLMORE said they were articles of lux-
ury; and as this was a tariff for revenue, they
ought to be made to contnbute.
The amendment was lost
The 4th section was next in order.
Mr ROOSEVELT moved some verbal amend-
ment; which was agreed to.
Mr FILLMORE proposed to amend the 1st

To Waddy Thompson, Esq
Envoi/ hxli aorúina?y, tyc , Mexico
After the reading of the communications by the
Secretary,
Mr. PRESTON rose and observed, that as the
executive proceedings of the Mexican Government
Iwd been given to the public through the Spanish
newspaper , ?s well as our own, previous to their
official communication to this Government, it be-
came highly desirable that the position 10 which
this Government stands m relation to those pro-
ceedings should be dis mctly known The mam
objtct of the call for the cfBcial correspondence
was to exhibit to the public mmd, and to the whole
civilutd world, the true position which this Gov-
ernment occupies with reference to Mexico. His
mlention, at present, was merely to move for the
printing of the documents, and (or their reference
to the Comn lttee on Foreign Relations; and in
doing so, he could not bu' express the gratification
whuh he felt wth thp course which the public
functionaries of tnis Government had pursued.
The Government hid assumed that attitude
which hi r imer st and her dignity required;
and he believed .ill would agree with him,
that that attitude had been assumed with a
gracefulness and propriety which was highly
creditable to those who conlueted the executive
affairs of this county He was exceed ngly grat-
ified lo find that the conduct of our Minister at
Mexico had been highly creditible to himself, and
honorable to this cow. ry Mi. Thompson had
executed his duty well a "i fai Lfu'ly.
It was. clearly the du'y of the representative of
this nation to meet ihe charge's which had been dis-
seminated by the Mexican au'hcnties against the
Government of this country, by addressing himself
to the same tribunal to which the cuarges had been
addressed—namely, the various foreign diplomatic
corps resident at Mexico. This Mr. Thompson
had done, and in such a manner as must meet the
appioval of all. The language ot the corres-
pondence, and cf the various official documents, on
the part of this Government, appeared to Mm (Mr.
P ) as being sufficiently spirited to meet the views
of those who de ired to assert and maintain the
honor and the dignity of this nation, in advance of
all other considerations, and, at the same time, -so
moderate, that ihf fnends of a dignified modera-
tion and it rbearance cou d find nothing to object
to. This Government had acted wuh the utmost
forbearance that was. consistent with the repelling
of the injurious and uijust charges wh'ch had been
heaped upon us The} had always-, hitherto, treat-
ed Mexico inti the utiiost forbearance, in relation
to ihe claims of citizen  of this country upon the
Govern-nent cf Mexico, in consideration of the
embarr. s d resources of that country. And he
would venture to say th-it, if language such as that
recently held by Mexico towards the Government
of this country had been Esed by a nation of great-
er political power, the translations of the docu-
ments, when published m the way in which the
Mexican correspondence had been published,
would nave come to us accompanied by the repre-
sents ons of public mee ings in al! quarters of the
Union, expressing me universal indignation of the
community.
This country had submiued to the long continued
postponem' nt of ¡he .nderrmty to her plundered
c z-ti , and palien,ly b^f e the insult of the Mex-
ican ambassador'* sudden xuthdrawal by a sort of
flight, insidiously circulating, at the moment of his
departure, the most calumniating charges upon
his Government Notwithstanding this, the con-
/ention was agieedupon, that the c'aims might be
judicialy determined. But Mexico, instead of
sending two persons to lane their «eats in that con-
vention as judges sent two persons to act as dip-
lomitic agents, to rtsist, by all the arts of diplo-
