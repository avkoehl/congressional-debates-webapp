HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,March 31, 1865-7.45 a. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Your dispatch of 7.40 received. Is there any reason the Second Corps should not draw three days' rations, together with the Fifth? The empty supply wagons can be sent to the railroad terminus and refilled.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.

MARCH 31, 1865.

Major-General MEADE:

The Second Corps can also draw their rations the same as the Fifth.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,March 31, 1865-8.05 a. m.

(Received 8.25 a. m.)

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

I send a dispatch* just received from Major-General Warren, which will show the position of his troops and give topographical information. Additional tools will be sent to him as soon as they can be gotten up, so that the road he is on can be made passable for artillery and wagons at the earliest moment.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,March 31, 1865-8.40 a. m.

(Received 8.50 a. m.)

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Firing is heard apparently on left and left center of Second Corps. No report yet. Orders have been sent to Warren to support Humphreys if necessary. Perhaps it would be well to send same to Ord. Orders for rations issued, but I fear the condition of the roads will make their execution almost impossible.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.

GRANT'S HEADQUARTERS,

March 31, 1865. (Received 10.15 a. m.)

Major-General MEADE:

Rations must be got forward to Warren, and no exertions must be spared to execute your orders for the same.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
