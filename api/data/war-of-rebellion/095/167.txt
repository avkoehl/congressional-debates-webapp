50,000 feet of lumber, &amp;c. We took nineteen days' rations, four being cooked. We sailed at daylight of January 9, and reached Fort Monroe that evening. On January 10 we were detained by a severe storm, but sailed at 8 a. m. of January 11, arriving at Beaufort, N. C., on the following day in time to join the fleet then starting for Fort Fisher, where we arrived about 5 p. m.

During January 13 we were ordered to remain on board. On January 14 I put the engineer company on shore, with thirty-seven animals, rations, forage, &c. The sea was too rough to land the guns. The steamer was anchored, and a warp of 3-inch rope, 120 fathoms long, was secured to be beach. The men were pulled in surf-boats, and the animals slung, hoisted overboard, and towed ashore by the warp. On the 15th the sea was smoother. I had brought three launches and a detachment of thirty-five men of General Graham's naval brigade, under lieutenant nelson, to aid in disembarking my train. I also received all the assistance required from the navy. Acting Muster Z. L. Tanner, aided by Acting Ensign L. Pope, both of the Rode Island, took charge of removing the stores, &c., from the ship's side to the beach, and labored most faithfully and skillfully on January 14 and 15 to accomplish all that was possible. On January 15, three 30-pounder Parrotts, complete, with ammunition, &c., another company, the rest of the animals, the wagons, &c., were unloaded. The guns were unloaded in the following manner: They were raised from the hold, and slung overboard, by using purchases from the masthead and the yards strengthened by a prevented brace. They were carefully lowered overcoat, and placed on the launch (one at a trip), with very considerable risk, owing to the rolling of the ship. The launch was then pulled along the warp to the edge of the surf, and the gun rolled overboard. It was draped up by about 200 men pulling upon a rope secured to it. It was a slow and dangerous process, and only possible in very smooth sea. The carriages, ammunition, &c., were landed in a similar way.

Fort Fishere was carried by assault on the evening of January 15, and the disembarkation of my train was at once suspended. Captain Hatfield, my ordnance officer, was ordered by me to make a survey of the fort. A copy of his sketch will be forwarded to the department upon his return from a leave of absence.
