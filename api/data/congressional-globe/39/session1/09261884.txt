Mr. NYE. It will be recollected by some of
the Senators present that on the 9th day of
March, 1865, ] had the honor to present the
following resolution, which was adopted by the
Senate:
"Resolved, That the Secretary of the jSnry ho re-
quested to organize a board, ot not less than three
competent i>erc'ons, whose duty itchall be to inquire
into and determine how much the ves?els-of-wnr and
steam machinery contracted for by the Department
in the year? lbOJ and 1863 eo^t the contractors over
and above t ho contractpriee and allowance tor extra
work, and report the same to the Senate at it< next
session. None but those that have given satisfaction
to the Department to be considered."
As tliis is a very important bill and appro-
priates considerable money, and as the report
made by the board is embodied in the report
which the Committee 011 Naval Affairs had the
honor to submit in connection with this bill, I
ask that the report of the comjnittee be read
for the information of the Senate.
The Secretary read the following report, sub-
mitted by Mr. Xye on the 22d of March:
The Cniranittce on Naval A flairs, to whom was re-
ferred the communication of the? Secretary of the
iNavy.of the date ot January 30,1866, inelordng a copy
ot the rccord of the board of naval officers, organized
pursuant to the resolution of the Senate of'March
9,1865, report:
That on the 9th day of March, 1805, the Senate

in the years 1862 and 1863 cost the contractors over
