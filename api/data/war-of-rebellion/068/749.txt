General MEADE:

There are over 7,000 stand of arms collected on the field, but I have no way of removing them. What disposition shall be made of them?

HEADQUARTERS,May 14, 1864-9.15 a.m.

Major General W. S. HANCOCK:

At the present moment it is impracticable to move to the rear the arms alluded to in your dispatch of this morning. The commanding general wishes you to have them sent to Belle Plain when you have empty wagons going for supplies that can be used for the purpose; and in case your command should be moved before they can be taken away, he desires you to have them destroyed, should this be necessary to prevent them from falling into the hands of the enemy.

S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
