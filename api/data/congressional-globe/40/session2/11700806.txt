southern land grants.
Mr. MUNGEN. I call forthe regular order.
The SPEAKER. The regular order is the
bill (H. R. No. 2(17) to declare forfeited to the
United States certain lands granted to aid in
the construction of railroads in the States of
Alabama, Mississippi, and Florida, and for
other purposes. On this bill the gentleman
from Indiana [Mr. Jul,tan] is entitled to the
floor for twenty-five minutes.
Mr. JULIAN. 1 have agreed that two
amendments may be offered to this bill, and I
would be glad if the gentlemen desiring to
offer them would have them read nowfor infor-
mation. I yield for that purpose.
Mr. ARNELL. I desire, when it shall be
in order, to offer the following amendment:
At the end of section first insert the following pro-
viso :
Provided, That this forfeiture shall not apply to
the grant of lands made by the United States to the
State of Alabama for the benefit of tho Tennessee
and Alabama Central railroad, which is now known
as the Nashville and Decatur railroad.
Mr. PILE. I desire at the proper time to
offer the following amendment:
Add to the first section the following additional
proviso:
And iimvidnlfurther. That this act shall not apply
to hinds (Trailted by tile United States to the Statu
of Alabama to aid in the construction of certain rail-
roads in said State by act, of Congress, approved
.rune 1ST), ami which lands were granted by tho
Stnto of Alabama to the Alabama and Tennessee
lliver llailroad Company.
Mr. BLAINE. I desire to give notice of my
intention to offer the following amendment as
an additional section;
Ami he it further enacted, Thatnll other land grants
to any States or railroad corporations that liavo ex-
pired by limitation are hereby declared forfeited and
made subject to settlement under the regulations of
the homestead law.
Mr. JULIAN. Mr. Speaker, before resum-
ing my remarks on this bill f must renew my
request not to be interrupted, for the simple
reason that I cannot otherwise conclude what
I desire to say within the time allotted me.
Besides, sir, I am afraid that some bloody
results might follow if the altercation of the
other day should be renewed between myself
and some of the belligerent gentlemen on the
other side of the House. [Laughter.] Let
me say again, also, that I wish to have this
bill fully and thoroughly discussed, and that I
hope, therefore, no dilatory motions will be
interposed. I ask that the proposition shall
be met and disposed of upon its merits, and
to this end I have agreed that certain amend-
ments may be offered which some gentlemen
deetn important. The bill has had two post-
ponements already, and the recommitment of
it to the committee which reported it or any
similar policy of evasion or delay would very
probably be fatal. Lot us discuss it and dis-
pose of it under the opportunities which now
invite us to do so.
Mr. Speaker, when I was interrupted in the
previous discussion I was proceeding to com-
ment upon the loyalty of the New Orleans and
Opelousas Railroad Company, and I was re-
ferring to their own memorial to Congress,
setting forth the grounds on which they ask a
revival and continuance of their land grant.
They say in this memorialâ€”
' That the relations of the laanngers of this rail-
road company to the Government from the first day
of the capture of New Orleans have been entirely
friendly, and that, the legal existence of the. corpora-
tion was at all times officially recognized by Major
Generals uutlkr, hanks, and Canby, the military
Governor, General Shepley, and the acting mayors
of New Orleans, and their subordinate officers, as can
be fully shown by the records."
I submit, sir, that the fact that General
Banks, and General Bctler, and General Shep-
ley recognized the legal existence of this cor-
poration is by no means a ground on which to
rest their application for indulgence at the
hands of Congress.
They go on to sayâ€”
" That from that early period of the war, 1st May,
1862, to its close, during which, and until tho trans-
fer of the road to the company again, 1st February,
1866, the United States Government, through its
officers, have had tiie free occupation and use of its
road, material, and machinery, for military purposes,
having tho first, night of the capture of the city quar-
tered Colonel McMillan's Indiana regiment in their
spacious depot at Algiers and suspended thcrunning
of its trains."
Mr. BANKS. I desire to say that I never
recognized the legal existence of that road.
Mr. JULIAN. Then the fact which I read
from the memorial of this company is untrue.
But suppose it were true that General Banks
or General Butler recognized the legal exist-
ence of the corporation, or that they seized
this road and its depot while Colonel McMillan
quartered his Indiana regiment in it on its
arrival in the city; I submit that the mere fact
that this corporation yielded to overwhelming
force is by no means a proof of their loyalty
or of their right to ask any favor whatsoever at
the hands of Congress. I do not understand
that there is any special merit in yielding to
what is inevitable ; certainly not. They were
compelled to "accept the situation," forthe
simple reason that there was no other alterna-
tive left them.
