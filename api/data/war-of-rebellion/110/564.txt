RICHMOND, VA., November 25, 1863.

General B. BRAGG,

Chickamauga, Tenn.:

Have read your dispatch.* You must draw forward all available troops-local defense and others-as rapidly as possible. The re-enforcement sent by General Johnston should be near at hand, and I hope Longstreet is in condition to co-operate. Your minute knowledge of the ground will enable you to choose advantageous positions.

JEFFERSON DAVIS.

RICHMOND, VA., November 27, 1863.

General B. BRAGG,

Ringgold, Ga.:

Are you in communication with General Longstreet? Have the re-enforcements from General Johnston arrived? Have the local troops joined you? You have need to concentrate rapidly.

JEFFERSON DAVIS.

ORANGE COURT-HOUSE, November 27, 1863.

His Excellency President DAVIS,

Richmond, Va.:

I fear the falling back to General Bragg may compromise Longstreet. Communication with him should be opened through Bristol.

RICHMOND, November 27, 1863.

Major-General RANSOM,

Bristol:

(To be forwarded.)

If you are not in communication with General Longstreet, endeavor to open it and inform him of all matters in your front; also, that General Bragg has fallen back before superior fores at Ringgold and hopes to make a stand there, and that his co-operation is necessary and the greatest promptitude required.

JEFF'N DAVIS.

[31.]

RICHMOND, VA., November 30, 1863.

Colonel W. P. JOHNSTON,

Aide-de-Camp:

COLONEL: You will proceed immediately upon the receipt of this order to Bristol, Tenn., and after consultation with Major-General Ransom, will communicate with General Longstreet respecting the matter upon which you have been verbally instructed.

Very respectfully, yours,

JEFFERSON DAVIS.
