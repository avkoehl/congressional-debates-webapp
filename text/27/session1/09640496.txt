REMARKS OF MR. RIVES,
CP   VIRGINIA
In Senate, August 26,1841—On the bill for the distribution
of the proceeds oí the public lands among the States
Mr RIVES said that such frequent and pointed references
had been made, in. the course ef tne debate to diy, to tin, poj i
cy of Virginia in connection with the question of the public
lands, that he feh himself called on to make some remaikson
the subject before the question was taken on the passage of the
bill Ihe foenator from Illmoise [ÍVJr Youag] who had jim
resumed his seat, says that the great object oí Virginia, in her
munificent endowment of the Union with the lareest and best
portion of her territory, was the settlement of the ceded lands
And has not this object been faithfully and steadily pursued
Has not the policy of the Government, with the hearty concur
rence of Virginia m every mearme looking (o that end, been m
variably to dispose of the public lands on such liberal and ac
commodating terms as to promote the rapid settlementofour
raeant tern orv"1 And h we not the fiuits of that policy in the
multiplication and giowthof the new States, been absolutely
marvellous, partaking fai moreoftlechiractei ofmagicthan of
sober reality* Already have four new States, m all ihe pride of
wealth and empire, sprung up within the limits of the cession of
Virginia, one of them destined to take the lead evenol the paient
Common wealth m the apportionment oí representation ard poh
tical power under the new census 1 he annals of the world may
be explored in vain for any parallel to the extraordinary pro
gressofsettlementand popula ion in those new States, under
the benign and fostering policy which has been pursued towards
them by this Government, with the cordial sympathy and ac
quiescence of the old States TheSenator's own state (Illinois)
presents an example that would absolutely defy belief, but for
the incontestable evidence of authentic return?, having ttf bled
her population, if I mistake not, in the short interral between
the two decennial enumerations of 1S20 and 1^0 And is not
the same policy of settlement faithfully and most liberally pui
sued in the bill mwgbefore usl For the first time, a general
and prospective Die emption enactment is made by this bill in
favor of actual settler-, on the public land* Hitherto, the ut
most extent of concession has been to pass occasionally a retro
active law, m the natme of an act of amnesty, allowing pre-
emption rights tosucli personsasmiy have alreub, within a
limited period, settled upon the pub ic lan is without lawful t tie
But this bill s cuies in advance, preemption rights, at the
minimum puce to poisons entering upon to  public lands
wi houtany previous title, and selecting the choicest *f it*  at
■will foi then habitation, thus giving the stnngesf stimulus
and encouragement of the law to settlement This bill also still
faithful to i he same policy of settlement gives a perpetual
guarantee agajnsi any inert a«e ot the puce of tne public lands,
"by apena! piovieit n thai, if at any time hereafter a law'•hi!1
be passed to iai«e that pnce, ihedistubu ion among the States

There is, however, another in I fundamental object that Vir
gima had in view m niaki "' this magnificent donation to the
IJnion, which tne honorable Senatoi seems for the moment to
havefoigotten It was, tha the fruits: ()¡ her noble gereiosity

ultimately carry his measureí Jf i hid doubted before (said
Mr Hives) the urgent necessity of making some final dieposi
tion of the question of the public lands, which will place this
great common fund of all the States beyond the reach of these
schemes of partial and exclusive appiopnation, these warnings
would have convinced me of the tnti< al and indispensable lm
portance of action at the present moment
if the representatives of the new States had been content to
let the question of the public lands lemam on the footing on
which it has been heretofore placed by the beneficent leadla
tion of Congres-i, Viremia, for one would have cheerfully ac
quicced m the continued application ol this common fund to
the expenditure and appropriations of the Federal Government
howe\er small has ever been any «=haie that has fallen to hei
lot in those appropriations    But w her she has seen a policy
bolJlv pux-iauned and actively pei^isted in. to wiestthis com
mnn fund fiom the common usfs of the Unon, in violation of
tl e fundamental condition expressly decfaied m the deeds of
ce-oion from herse fand the other propnetar «tares, and virtu
a'ly to suirendei thn precious inheritince of all the States, to
the exclusive enmyment of a few of tnem she has felt that t^t1
time had come whe i she must aid m placing the common fund
in dbiuicsfion where it would be the equal mterebt of all to piu
tect it from dilapidi'ion or monopr'/     It is this which has at
length aroused Viremia fiom the facility and acquie^ence she
had so long manifested on the subject of the public lands  and
caused h r to pronounce her voire m favor of di^ribution, as
the policy bcM. calculated to enfoice andftifil the claims of
equal just ce among all the States    The popular bra tchof her
Legislature, two year  ago, by a large inajoritv, (77 to 49 )
passed a resolution   (among others on the same sublet ) in
which they "earnestly uige upon Confess the speedy adop
tion oí some equitable plan for thf distiibutiop of the nett pro
ceeds of the sales of the public lands among the States "    D
cided as this expression of opinion m favorofdistubution is, it
yet fallb far short of the condemnation pronounced at the same
tune and in tin sime form, of thobe piojet (&, w'w It are theac
know ¡edged alternative of distr bution   for to on-1   can have
heard the discussions upon this bill w thout feehng that the
true pi acuca! i&aii , now presented totl e count] y, is between
graduation or cession oi the one hand, and distribution on. the
other.
I beg leave to lead c th** [Senate the rcoltifon adopted by
the Hou^e of Deleg upsof\ iremia on the oc a si on leftiiedto
in which th«y expected by a ma,onty whoiJv nnpip^ede i ed

grants of large quantities of ihe public lands have been from
time to time made for the establishment of colleges and semi*
naries of learning in the new States, and, in virtue of a stand-

the 16th section in every township of landis set apart for the
support of pnmaiy schools And yet the wildest latuudma

by similar applications of the onimaiy levenue, assume a

Ihe real difficulty a tending the question is tne of time, and
lie-in considerations connected with the actual cor dition of the
publn Tieasuiy In the remarks I had the honoi to-jubmitto
the S nate on this subject, duting the last sesión of Congress, I
stated the daneer there might be, that if the land fund were
withdrawn from the National Treasury in its piesent embar
lassed condi ion, such an increase of the revenue from custom**
would be called for astomvolve the risk of disturbing the tariff
comprormst oí 1833 Regarding the maintenance of that com-
promise in fact as an essential bond of peace and harm ny m
tho Union, it seemed to me that justice and policy d^man led
that the distribution of the proceeds of the pub! c land  among
the Sines should not take place until a ¡satisfactoiy guaianteo
was g ven that the adoption of the measure should not be per-
muted to lead to the imposition of new duties in any manner
conflicting w h the principles and provisions ofthecompio-
mieeact of 1333 Tha'guarantee has at length been given by
tl e mcorpoiation of an amendnient in the bid before us, ee
c'anng in the mo«t so enin an 1 unequivocal form tnat if a*
any timeheieafter Orgte^sshall pass a law imposing any duty
exceeding the ra e of-Üppr cent a  stipulated by the compro
mise act, fiom that moment th" distribution of the land fund
among the States shall be suspended * This amendment
furnishing every piactieable security against an increa e of
the tariff, in violation of the compromise act, and conforming
to thp fullest extent to the views declared by the popuiai
branch of the Legislature of my State m the proceedings to
which I have already referred, I shall, without hesitation,
record my vote in favor of the passage of the bill 1 do so
from the desne I feel at all times to confosm my representative
action here Mr the se irr ents and opinions of my state, as de-
clared by the more immediate organs of her will and in the
thoiou¿h convienen that between a virtual surrender of ths
common inheritance o* the public domain to a few favored
States, Under the name of graduation or ce sion on the one
hand andan equal distribution of the common fjndamonffaU
the States on the othei, (which it can be no longer doubtful 19
the sole practical alterative now presented to us,) there would
bf the same itnantm ty of decision among her people as has
characterized the pjoceedmga of their immediate representa
tive& in the popular biarch of her Legis ature If the 1 1! shall
pass, h will finally settle a question which, from the onsin of
