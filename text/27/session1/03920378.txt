not vote for this, becaase it wa> the first instance
in the historv of the Government, 'mee its orgam
zalion m 1789, in wh eh the proportion had been
directly submitted to thro v this Department on the
Treasury. It gentlemen wou'd look back they
would not find a single act of Congress m which
this bad been done In the last war the Govern-
ment fooked to the Post Office Department as a
sonrce of revenue, and the ra'es of postage
were increased to m'et the expenses of
the war. It was not true therefore that
the Treasury was indebted over a million of
dollars to (he Post Office Department, as had been
alleged, for the Post Office Department was con
sidered a  on*3 of th  ordmaiy s( urces of revenue
till after the war, when the principle was esta-
blished of allowing it aU its own revenues, in or-
der to nictease the mail faciht cs Since that time
the pol cy has prevailed of making the revenues
of the Department support its expenditures Now,
said Mr M yon have authorize 1 a loan of twelve
millions of dullart to meet the demanls tn tie
Treasury, but was it contemp ated by a single i '-
dividual who voted for that loan, that this lt^m of
five hundred thousand dollars for the Post Office
Department was to come out of if* Suppose you

the Department, on going into it, deeply in debt,
but by prudent management it was ewicakdfroui
its difficulties, and provided with ample means to
cany on ns operation-. He could not s e that the
Government pr^r was under any ob igatu ns to

fore complain They knew lhat by long set-
t'ed usage, ihe Pi st O/fiie was to be sup-

debts contracted by it were contrac cd on Us
own faith only He could not vote for this bill,
if it ti as to make the appropnat on out of the com-

Mr KING observed, that in toe organization of

here ofore invariable—ihe  usage  uniform      Trie
first business, on the meeiiT* of eieh House, afte

giess shall  be referred, the practice always has
be n to place a majority of the friends of  the
Administrali n   on   eaei   committee       This   is
st íe'ly   correct,   in   order   to insuie  a  favora-

principles of parliarreitary Iw,  following as it
did, immediately on  the  heeli of a similar  bill,
which had, most fortunately for the country, re-
ceived the veto of the President, and ultiTately
rejected by the Senate
The parliamentary law, which has been a guide
tolheacion of Corgress heretofore,  forbid   the
introduction a.t Ihe «ame  sesión of any measure
which has been tt jeeted during that session.   This
has been disregarded    The rules of the Senate
forbade htm to «peak  of the action of the  other
House on this subject as be could wish    He re-
gretted that he was not at liberty to present their
conduct plainly to the people, to show to the coun-
try   what  it  has  to   expect   from    the    domi-
nant party here, and  what   kind   of measures
may be expected   from   the   mode  of legisla-
tion which has been adopted    The P^cal Corpora-
atio"5 bi'1 has, however, come to us, and he (M".
Kivg)   and his friends, much as hey were op-
posed to its in roductiou or passage, determined to
give to it a fair and open opposition    No objec-
tion was made to the notion of the Senator from
Georg a to send it to a select committee, and that
that committee shou'd be appointed by the presid-
ing officer.   The President of ih  Senate made the
selection,   but, to his (Mr K's) great surprise, on
reading-   he   names this morning in one of the
pubhc papers,   he   found  they were   all mem-
bers  of   the   dominan    parlj     not   one select-
ed  for this   most important   committee   belongs
to   th    m nority   in   this   body   opposed  to the
bill     Why was it, he (Mr King) must be pem t-
ted to ask   that the pres ding officr had depar ed
from a rule which, m all the fluctuations of pany,
and in the highest times of party excitement, had
never b >fore been departed froral   D d he think
the minority hid not an equal n terest in pending
measures vti h other Senators,  or that those we re-
present are notas much entitled to have their rights
and inierrsts prot cied and preserved as the consti-
tuents   of   those   'avored   Sena ors?     No,   sir,
this   he    w) I   no     admit       Why,    then,    this
marked    and    unnstal     excluson'l     Was    it
that    the     friends    of    this    measure     were
unwilling that any of the minority should be pre-
sent to hear tneir disagreements and witness ihe
dilemmas and difficulties?   There must have been
a motive m thus departing from a course sanction-
ed by time, and by every princ pie of propriety.
It will be for the presiding officer to state what that
motive was    Mr  Kino must be permitted to re-
peat, the m°re to impress it on the minds of Sena-
tors,  lhat daring more than twenty years he had
been   in   Congress,   he  had   never   known im-
portant    coomitleei    to    be     appointed,    either
stardmg   or   se'eU,    in    which    «one   memb r
of     the    tben     mininty    did     rot    consti u'e
a portion, until this  most extr-io'diniry  selection
of a c rrimute , to repo t ou  ih <s most important
li       Wtiihl   ltio', ( -id Mr King,) have  been
prudent, as   wt.ll as just, to  n-nve given to   the
minority    a    fa r    opporiunuy    of    sug^esticg
their  objections   in   committee?    The   friends < f

th-m     He  (Mr King)  had not  risen to make a
motion,  but merely to present this esiraordmary
proceeding to  toe vi w ot   the Senate,  and leave
