Numbers 2. Report of Lieutenant Robert H. Milling, Cole's Battalion Maryland Cavalry.

CAMP AT BOLIVAR, VA., August 25, 1862.

SIR: In obedience to an order received from Captain Henry A. Cole, commanding battalion, bearing date of August 4, 1862, I proceeded to Smithfield with 20 men for the purpose of picketing, as well as to arrest all returned rebel soldiers, capture their horses and arms, and also to keep all contraband articles from being conveyed to the enemy, which duties I performed until Saturday evening, August 23, when we were surprised by Baylor's (rebel) cavalry. My pickets were first captured by them. They then charged through the village, capturing the following of my men, viz: * * * ; making 17 in all, and had it not have been that I had with me on duty Sergeant Winters and 2 men we would in all probability be with them. The rebels numbered from 30 to 40.
