Occoquan. Last night and this morning bridges were thrown over the river at the railroad crossing and at Kelly's Ford. Infantry was crossed at each place, and the necessary works to protect the bridges will be constructed. The railroad bridge will be immediately repaired. At 10 a. m. this morning, Buford's cavalry division crossed at the railroad crossing, and soon encountered the enemy's cavalry. The latest report from him, just received, dated 4. 30 p. m., he had driven Jones and Hampton's brigades to within 1 1/2 miles of Culpeper, where he reports A. P. Hill's corps to be in position. He has been ordered to fall back, and hold as advanced a position in front of the Rappahannock as he can do with security.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

No telegram was sent yesterday, being Sunday. Late Saturday night {August 1, Buford's command of cavalry reported that, after driving the enemy's cavalry to within 1 1/2 miles of Culpeper Court- House, he was met by 5, 000 infantry and three batteries of artillery, who compelled him to retire this side of Brandy Station, at which point they ceased their pursuit. Buford took up a position between the Rappahannock and Brandy Station, which he has held undisturbed yesterday and to-day, though at times to-day the enemy's cavalry assumed a menacing attitude, believed by General Buford an attempt to examine our position. The position of the army is as last reported, excepting that there are two divisions of the First Corps on the right bank of the Rappahannock, at the railroad crossing, and one brigade of cavalry posted in front of Kelly's Ford, picketing toward Stevensburg and the fords on the Lower Rapidan. The signal officer on Watery Mountain, near Warrenton, reports the disappearance of camps near Culpeper, and a movement of wagon trains from that point toward Orange Court-House. The cavalry on the left report no force on this side near Falmouth; but a prisoner states that Cooke's brigade, 3, 000 strong, had arrived at Fredericksburg from Richmond. The railroad bridge over the Rappahannock was repaired to-day.
