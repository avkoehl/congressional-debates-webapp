Major-General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

Recent reports of the senior surgeon of General Bragg's army, left here in care of the wounded rebels, prepared to be sent to his superior, of the death in hospitals, carefully analyzed as to confirm the analytical report of our provost-marshal as to the number of regiments, show that Breckinridge had thirty-six infantry and five cavalry regiments, four batteries, and some minor organizations in his division.
