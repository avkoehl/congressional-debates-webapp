GENERAL OBSERVATIONS, NOTES, AND QUERIES.

156. Parrott rifled guns.

There is, perhaps, no better system of rifled cannon than Parrotts; certainly none more simple in construction, more easily understood, or that can with more safety be placed in the hands of inexperienced men for use.

The enormous and constant demand under which it has been rapidly developed, particularly among the large calibers, to its present state of efficiency and excellence, gives promise of a degree of perfection that will leave little to be desired at no distant future.
