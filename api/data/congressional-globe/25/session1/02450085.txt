note of Uss denomination than tuenty doHms shall
hereafter be offered in payment in any ca&e what-
soever m which money i¡> to be paid by the United
States or the Post Office Department, nor shall
any bank note, of any denominaron, be so offered,
unless the same shall be payable, and paid, on de-
mand, in gold and silver com, at the place wheie
issued, and which shall not be equivalent to specie
at the place where offered, and con vertible into
gold or Silver upon the spot, at tne vwll of the
holder, and withoutdelaj or lo-ato him "
This provision was adopted, and is the law the
vote m the Senate being ave^ 22, noes 13, my own
vote being recoided in its favor Now thi> is the
law, and the Senatoi from Virginia do^s not
propose fo change" it No v, are these bank notes
that the Senatoi from Virginia would permit the
Government to pay out and receive, actually "equi-
valent to specie, and convertible into gold or
silvei on the spot at the will of the holdei, and
•without delay or loss to him'*" Then the result of
the law, as that Senator would have it iemam, is
the same m its operation in this respect as the bill
now before us gold and stiver, or its full equna-
lent, being the effect of ei hei system But if this
be not so, and these bank notes be in f?ct a baser
currency than gold orsihei, what right or power
has this Government to force this baser currency
upon the peop'e by public disbursements, when
this Government can make nothing but go d or
silver a legal tender in the paj ment of debts'* No,
sir* the operation of this bill will be to improve
the currency of the who'e people by its incidental
effects in diminishing bank paper issues, and en-
larging, at lea&t to that extent, the general cncula-
tion of gold and silver. But the deposite bank
system will, indeed, force a doubtful and unceifim
bank p^per circulation upon the people,convertible
into specie one day, and nconvcr* jle and depre-
ciated to-morrow
We have been told that the terms divorce of Bank
and State, as lemmding the people of the divorce
of Church and State, are popular catchwords I
have not used these terms, al'hough I firmly be-
lieve that the union of Bank and State would soon
prove as fatal to liberty as the union of Church and
State, but, let me ask, aie not the terms u^ed upon
the other side—one cunencyfor the people, and
another for the Government, and the terms sepa-
rating the Government fiom the people, mere
popular catchwordb wmch, viHnot bear, as we
have seen, the slightest examination It is said
this bill will destroy cudit, by impairing cons-
cience m banks Have not we had- too much con-
fidence m banks, and hav<* thev not proved the
greatest and universal destroy crs of all credit and
all confidence*2 Yes, these veiy banks, by their
expansions, contract onc, and failures, destroye 1 all
confidence and all credit, not only m themselves,
but also between man and man, and almost be-
tween nation and nation It is the banks that ren-
der prices, confidence, and credit, fluctuating anl
uncertain, and, before their existence, the pa^e of
history tells that confidence and ciedit, between
man and man, were infinitely more universal, and
that piotests oí bills of exchange and mcrcaniiie
tile failures were then almost wholly unknown
Specie was not hoarded, nor credit withheld from
honest industry, but universally extended, uncheck-
ed by that overthrow oí a 1 confidence, and all
credit, arising from expansions, contractions, and
explosions of the bank paper system We are
told that confidence, confidence, is the masic vord,
and the Government has only to brea he ip'o the^e
banks the bream of confidence, an 1 all will be
well Sir, if the ° banks, hmitel and íes timed by the State

REMARKS OF MR. HAYNE5!,
Ol    GlORCjIA,
In the House  of Rep> eientalwes, October 3, 1837—
On the M^si-s ppi Election
Mr HAYNCS inv\ that, until particular cir-
cura^tai ces had calif d h^ dttentiou to the subject
of diwuss on ytbterdd}, he had not m =nded to

In pioceedmg to etamme fie clanp of fre fitting
mpmbeis rrom the State of MisMS^ippi lo «eats in

iation The first and íposl ímpor'ant is, did such
a vacancy exist in th„ represen ation as to autho-
nze ¡ho Go/ernor to issue his writ of election for
filling it1 and the ec nd i , admitting such vacancy

order an election to fill a vacancy in ihis Hou^e,
no term or limitation i& used lesiuctnf tl^t right
and lhat duty to an; part'culai set of circumslanceb
whatsoever The words of ihe CoiW tution are:
"When vacancies happen m the lepn.'-eniation of a
Si-te, ¡he Execaiive authority thereof shall issue
«ins of election to fi 1 such va aiicte- '* Could
'angpnge be mrre broad tnan .h"t eisplo>ed by the
federal co uention in eni) oaenng the Goveinoi of
a St?*e to fill vacancies in this House? It certainly
cculdnot But m liming at a conclus on up; a
the subject of tkcanc) or no \?cancy, it appeared
lo him lhat gentlemen had carried lo (he coiiMÍera-
tion of ihe causes which mignt produce &uch
tanncj', the same narrow and errencots notions
which had governed their interpretation of the
term vacancy itseif They bad confined those
causes exclusively to the act of the individual
incumbent, or the providence of God acting upon
hÉtn, when it bhould have been equally applitd lo
those whose duty it should be to see that no va-
cancy should be suffered to exist without ha\ ing il
nnmediatelj filled
To enable us lo atmeata just conclusnn of
what was meant by the federal convention m con-
ferring upon the Governor of a State the power of
causing \ acancies m this House to be filled, it is
necessary to inquire into the motives of that body
in organizing the Congress of the United Stales
And what was that motive? In announcing that
motive, he m uld place himself upon ground wh'ch
he ti as very sure no gentleman would contravert.
tint m ere? ting the House ot Representatives, as
well as the Senate it «as the purpose of the con-
vention, m each c^se, to create a perpetual office.
Tint th s uts the office, i the necessary conse-
quence of their high purp se to creite a perpetual
Government They gave to the Senators the term
of six, and to the Repiesentativcs the term of two
years But as a consequence, too obvious'and m-
evitaUe to be contes'ed, of creating a perpetual
office to carry on a peipetual Government, the
succession must also be perpetual. In proof of
such intention, various considerations of a charac-
ter too irrts stible to be denied, may be presented
to the consideration of the House In setting the
new system in m< tion, its operation commenced on
the 4th of Maich, 1789 , thus fixing the time fn m
wh ch the cons tut onal term ol the members of
the Senate and House of Representa ives should
be computed A'l the elections to Congress were
comp'eted in anticipation of it, and on that day,
if he was not greatly mistaken, was the nrst session
of the First Congress commenced, thus fixing the
starting point for calculating the commencement of
ever} successive term of service in this House.
In ascertaining the intention of the parties to a
contract, whether public or private, we might de-
rive insti uction from a reference to their practice
under it There v. ere thirteen States concerned in
formni" the Federal Constilntion, se\en of which,
together mith two otheis «nice formed of portions
of them, Maine Massachusetts, Vermont, New
York, Nd Ji rsey, Pennsylvania, Delaware,South
Caiolina, rnd G oigia, now keep up a perpetual
succession in this House, sending here one hundred
and eighteen out ol the one hundred and seventy
membeis who lepre ent the old thirteen States.
The intenti n to pres ive the perpetuil succession
already ad\ erled to, is as plainly indicated m the
powei conlerre 1 upon the Governor of a State to
fill vacancies -nd ilnt reserved to Congress to
legisate n d fan't of Stit* legis'ation, as it well
could have V n so f u liom the e being such re-
