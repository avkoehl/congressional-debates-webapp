MAJOR: With this your will receive an order* relieving you from the command at Fort Larned and assigning you to the command of Fort Lyon, with instructions to investigate and report upon to rumor in regard to the treaty made at Fort Lyon.

I am sufficiently well informed in regard to the views of the major-general commanding the department to say that he will not permit or allow any agreement or treaty with the Indians without his approval. In fact, his instructions are now to allow any Indians to approach any post of any excuse whatever. You will also state in your report if any officers have left the district without authority.
