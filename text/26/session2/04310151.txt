^ave been postponed until the fiist of April next, and that the
amount of ¡stipulated wages would ue reduced     If such is the
fact, will you have the jroodness to inform me and give me the
reasons for such postponement and reduction
Yours, with respect,
A  DUNCAN
To the Hon Levi Woodbury,
Secretary of the Tieasury
Here is his answer
TrfEAbiRY Department, Jan 23,1S41
Sir Inreply toyounnquinesof thisdate whether payment 
for labor on the public buildings in this city have been postponed
until the 1st of April next oi ihe amount of waies pioposed to
be reduced, and, if so, the reasons therefore, I have the honor
to submit the fallowing statement
All the labor on these buildings, earned on under the imine
díate charge of the Commissioners, has been paid foi as soon as
done, so far as my knowledge extends So has that performed
by contractors, it is piesumed as all the requisitions for money
to pay them have been piomptly met
liut, in a case of neces lty, sirce the appiopnation was ex
hausted, and luring the present month Í understand that the
Committee on Public Iiui dmss of the House of Repie entt
lives have, onapp Joatlon oftht woiluiien, advised the Su| er
lmendentof the 1'ublic Buildings to permit some of the labor
ers to work on some of the stone till the new appropnation pass,
and 1 presume that he has acquiesced in the adwee The
Board of Commissioneis, however, has not interfere I in this
case, noi has this Department, nor has eithei of them, proposed
any reduction m wages
Respectfully,
LEVI WOODBURi
Hon Alexander Duncan
P S fo obviate any mistake, I would add, that there is a
claim by some workmen for lost time, under a resolution to m
demmfy them passed by Congress at the ! 1st session but this
isnotfoi woikdone, but rathei lor inability to obtain work,
and as no appropriation has yet been made to pay tin el urn,
of eour^e it has not been aod cannot be paid till Congress think
proper to make one                                                           I   W
I addressed a similar communication to tne Se
cretary of War, m re atnn to the suspensions ot
payment for labor done at Old Point, and here i. his
answer
War Oi pice, January 23 1841
Sir You are aware, that at the last session of Congte s the
mili'ary appropriation bill contained a piovision, authorizing
the President to suspend the expenditure of certain amounts
theiein appropriated, if, in his opinion, the condition oi the
Tieasmy shoul i require it Aftei the adiournment the becre
ary of the Treasury signified to the Piesident, that the neces'l
tits of the Treasury required that he should avul himself of
the authoilty vested m him by th s clause, and sus[ end thi.se
expendituies This was accoidingly done but upon an assii
ranee from Mr Woodbury, thu ihe Treasury would be in a
more flouiishingconhüon it the end of the year 1^40 oi it far
thesthyA¡ il 1S4I I amhou/altheoliobis chalged with lho e
works,\\hieh,trom their nature, would have been seriously in
lured by entire suspension, to cany them on on a leductd
ücalojpr vided the contrac oís md woikmen would consent
wlthoutany additional ch-iitfe upin the fJoveinmeit tiwaitfil
payment until thefiist oí lintiary, or the fiistof Apn! No
reduction is to be made u| on the amount stij ulated t) be pa d
The President removed the older susptnding these ptynunts
and prohibiting the continuance of the woiks late in Octobei
last but the season w is too fai a Iv anced to renew them nth an-
tagcously—and it would still have been inconvenient to tile
Tieasuiy to anticipate ¡he payments promised foi tht
1st Januaiy Upon the passage of the Treastny lili
now under consideration, these payments and othcis foi
arrearages due for militia and sub&istenre in Flouda
will be made T have no doubt the Secietaiy of the Treasiuy
would have been able to meet all these demands if ihe íeceipts
had been simultaneous with them, but thta-e arc poi tions of th
year when the disbursements ate necessauly large and the le
ceipts small The Treasury, to be nee ttom embariassnient
must always have five millions suipius to "o and come upon
Veiy truly youis,
T    R  POINSETT
Hon   AlLXANDER DuNCAN
So it will be found m all cases wh°ie pajmen s
have been suspended The appropriations run
out, and tie woikmen <>re permitted to go on with
the work, upon ihe eondi'ion that they wi'l wait for
their pay until Congiess shall mak  an appiopri
ation. It is matter of choice and preference with
them. So it is with temp >rarv clerks, who are paii
from the contingent fun I. The fund run out, and
clerks of this dt*cripuon err, receive no pay, until
Congress appropna'es mot ey bull ihe clerks go
on to perform their work, upon then own r^sp n
sibihty, and at the r own risk If Congress should
make no appropriation, lhcy, as m tne ca«e cf Ihe
laborers on public works, wou'd receive no pay,
and this is what constitutes the suspension" <f paj-
ment which the gentleman alludes to, ¡>nd out ct
which he has manufactured such frauds on the mcV
of the Government, and such d s'ress on th  part of
th" poor workmen
I would not hüve trrubled ihe committee w th
this expose, only that I atn desunís of showing to
Ihe country how little reliance is to be piaced on
charges made upon the Administration by a p?nv,
whose contrd of the Government istobepetpe-
tuated by the same system of misrepresentation,
falsehood, and slander, which has brought them
into power
The gentleman from Maine [Mr Eyans] m-
du'geJ in both abu«e and scica^m of the War De-
partment, for what he csl's the ndeatcuy militia m
Florida. He derided such an org rnzation as
worse than wortrdess He treated it as the evi-
dence of imbecility on the part ot the Executive
and ihe War Department. This is a strange note
with what we heard last fall during ihe election
campaign. Tnen we were told by every Whig
speaker, from the political negotiator with the
shavers, stockjobbers, Shylocks, and brokers of the
London Exchange, (_Daniel Webster,) down lo ihe
most sniffling Whig whiffet of political mimicry,
that the Executive nas about to overset the liber-
ties of this country by a military despotism. The
weak and the mIIv, from one end of ti e Union to
the other, were thrown into alarm and consterna-
tion, weep ngs and wmliog , by ibe note of mdi'a
ry despotism The President was org-inizmg an
army of two hundred thousand men to seize upon
the lioertHS ol this people Th" wife was to be
deprived ol hei husband—the paient of his son—
and the sis'er of hei biother ill were to be press
ed into the 'ervice of the President, and marched,
and whipped, and shot, as ihe rules of war and the
laws oí d<-spoiism misht dictate But now the
President and the War Department are found with
what- welding the sc°ptre of despotism with an
army of two hundred thousand mm, with the
sword in one hand and the purse in the other
(Independent Trca^nr}') No, he is now found
struggling in aoompnrated war with a avage ene-
my, to maintain 'he honor of the nation, and 'he
safe'y and peace of its citizens, with a sedentary
army of fivehundred militia, whoce pay is six do'-
lars per rnonib, without the power to increase the
number or augment the pay; and he de-ided,
abased, and taunted, and his Admim (ration de-
nounced because of imbecility Tie abuse which
the gentleman drew from this organiza ion ff ' se-
dentary mihtia" induced me to investíale the sub-
ject. I opened a correspondence with Ihe Secreta-
ry of War, anl here are tne paper  vwih wbicu I
have been furbished They aie ths letters between
Ihe Secretary ol Wai and B'evetGeii. Read, com-
mpnder in Fluida, whuh show the whole system
of organizmon, and Ihe motives and objec's to be
effeci d hy it I will ask the Cleik to read these
papers, beginning at the one marked A and so pro-
ceed. [Th> Clerk nad ] I le,.ret, said Mr D.
thai the number au 1 length of those h tters. will pre-
vent me from giving them a place m my printed
remarks, whicn would make comrrent ipon Iht m
unnecessary I wnl now briefly expiain the ob
jeet and Ihe system.
The organization is called "infantry for nejgh-
hoihood defence in Florida " In the summer of
1838, Mr Poinseit recommended such an oigan'-
zation of the settlers who had been driven from their
farms by the Indians I need not infoim members
here that families who were drven from their farms
in Floridt vcrc furnished ration by a law of Con-
gres . The Secretary "f War conceived and
adopted the pbn of organizing such per ons for
"fireside" defence The obj=tf wís doubli , and
the le^ult has b en double The ooject w as to form
a milttaiy defence, and the improvement of the
country The result has been, th 't ihis organi7i-
tion (about ñ/e bundled m nu" b r) has svtpor-
sed d the «ame nnnber of moun'ed men, which
would have been requrtd, in addition to Ihe reyu
lai force m Florida; and it his been found, by ac-
tual calculan )n, that t is organization has cost but
one-siyth of the same rubber of mounted men
Anoiher result has been, thai th" Government has
been saved from \?st expense, winch it would have
incurred by the 'ranspoHaUon of gram and fo age
lor the support of troops and hoi es, which, io a
gfat exent, has been supplied b/ ibe cullivation
which this sjslem has encouraged ind secured
The duties and pnvileges whieh this organization
impo=e and secures are for a part of tho e em-
braced m it to cultivate their farm, while a part
au patrolling and scouting from post to post, they
are changed at the end of g vn interval  It is a
rule ot this realization, that no person ¡s to bo or-
dered more than t\> °n y mijes from bis farm and
this is wnat gent em°n depde and condemn, as
making the whole system weak and ndicjlt us, but
wi'hout such a rule, the who'e sys m would fail,
or rather it never have been established, and one ot
the leading objects (viz the cultivation of the
farms) would be defeated—for the militia could not
cultivate their farm?, if they were ordered a greater
distance than twenty miles from them, at frequent
intervals
It is supposed that this organization has been as
beneficial in point of military defence, as the same
number of mounted men wtuld have been for the
same time. It is reasonable to suppose so, for a
highei m.erest stimulates them. They defend their
farms and their fires des, as well as their country.
So much for the Pre ident's sedentary militia, so
much the subjec of Whig derision
Prior to the overlhrow of this Administration,
and to effect that purpose, this land was filled with
howhngs anl limf-ntaUoiH about its extravagance
and proflisact. Extravagant appropriations for
harbors, fortifications, national defences, public
buildings, canals, road', and every species of im-
provements, were paraded to expose ihe extrava-
gance of ihe Administration But hey has the
note changed ' We have heard Whig gentlemen,
for the last week, exhaust their mental and physi-
cal powers in denouncing the Administration for
(m their own language) its niggardliness and
penurronsness It is charged with having dri-
velled out insufficient appropriations, and the
dilapidated and decaying condition of the pub-
lic works and fortifications is now paraded
to expo e the pennrious, and miserable, selfish,
and narrow policy of this Administration, "to
save its popularity, and secure its re-election."
How will such notes meet the ear of the public,
whose heads are yet ringing with the peals of ex-
travagance, rum and profligacy1 Gentlemen may
reconcile tht e conflicting charges with a commu-
nity whom they hate so basely abused and misled.
It is no duty oí nunc
Bat while on the charges of extravagance before
die election, and of penuriou«nesssincethe election,

from t flinal ieports, which are aj true in politics
and finance as the book of worship is in divinity.
