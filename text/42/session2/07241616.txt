THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
March 12,
pails if these envelopes were not transported
in the cars. And no appreciable difference
would be made in the contract of the Post
Offico Department for carrying the mails if
the envelopes were not distributed, so that it
'is entirely a fallacy to suppose that there is this
charge made against the Treasury for trans-
mitting these stamped envelopes through the
mail.
So far as printing requests upon the en-
velopes is concerned, that, Mr. Chairman, is
of recent origin, but it saves to the Post Office
Department a large number of clerks who
would otherwise be required in the dead-letter
office. These requests save hundreds of thou-
sands of letters from going to the dead-letter
office, thereby burdening the mail, and re-
quiring the services of numerous clerks there
at salaries to return these letters to the writers.
Where the request is printed upon the letter it
is returned to the writer without going through
the mails to the dead-letter office at Washing-
ton, and being returned thence to the writer.
All that expense is saved.
Nor is it true that the Post Office Depart-
ment manufactures the envelopes or prints
them. The Post Office Department adver-
tises and lets the contract to the lowest bid-
der who will manufacture these envelopes,
and the printing of the request costs the De-
partment nothing. Printers in the country
do that. The envelopes are not made here in
Washington by the Department. The em-
ployment of mechanics is not prevented. Just
as many are employed in the preparation of
the envelopes with printed requests as if the
Government did not give out these contracts.
The system does not prevent competition.
Even the very man who has the contract for
supplying the Government with these postal
envelopes, manufactures millions upon mil-
lions of envelopes besides those which he
manufactures for the Government.
It is not true, either, that it is diminishing
the number required to be manufactured by
private companies. The increase in the num-
ber of envelopes manufactured and used has
been enormous, so that there is not an envel-
ope manufacturer in the United States but has
required additional facilities for carrying on
the manufacture. In every department of
business, upon your street railway cars, for all
manner of fancy purposes, for weddings, for
advertising agents, for every conceivable thing,
envelopes_ are required; and this system has
not diminished in any respect or lessened the
requirements of the country for those that are
used in ordinary business. As I said before,
the very man who has this contract manufac-
tures millions on his own account for sale
other than those for whieh he contracts with
the Government.
Now, really, Mr. Chairman, while I have
great respect for this committee of envelope
manufactures and stationers, I am bound to
say that they are wrong in this matter, en-
tirely wrong. Tho Committee on the Post
Office and Post Roads came to that conclusion
unanimously after considering the matter.
They simply ask—for it resolves itself into this
at last—tliey simply ask that we shall tax the
great body of the people who require and use
these envelopes, and impose a little protection
upon every envelope they use for their bene-
fit, in order that they may be able to ask and
obtain a little higher price.
[Here the hammer fell.]
The question being taken on the pending
amendment, it was disagreed to.
Mr. WOOD. Mr. Chairman, is it in order
to move to increase this appropriation to
$1,000,000.
The CHAIRMAN. It is.
Mr. WOOD. Is it in order for me to dis-
cuss the question whether the money will be
in the Treasury at the end of the next fiscal
year with which to pay this increase in the
•appropriation ? I make this inquiry so as to
.avoid interruption.
The CHAIRMAN. The gentleman will
proceed in the line of his remarks, and if he
should be out of order the Chair will rule
upon it.
Mr., WOOD. I propose to increase the ap-
propriation to $1,000,000 for thispurpose, and
I propose to show that instead of a deficit of
$10,000,000 at the expiration of the next fiscal
year, on the SOth of June, 1878, we shall have
a balance of over $100,000,000, plenty where-
with to pay this appropriation, and reduce
taxation besides.
Mr. GARFIELD, of Ohio. I make the
point of order on that line of remark.
Mr. WOOD. _ I await the decision of the
Chair on the point of order before I proceed.
The CHAIRMAN. If the gentleman con-
forms himself to the line he has indicated the
Chair will rule him to be in order.
Mr. GARFIELD, of Ohio. Is it in order
to argue that because there is money in the
Treasury, therefore we ought to increase the
appropriation ?
The CHAIRMAN. The Chair thinks that
is a logical argument. The gentleman pro-
poses to increase this appropriation so far as
the condition of the Treasury will warrant him
in doing.
Mr. WOOD. Mr. Chairman, the gentleman
from Massachusetts, [Mr. Dawes, ] in his speech
on Friday last, made an estimate of the re-
ceipts and disbursements of the Government,
showing the reasoning and the figures by which
he came to the conclusion he then announced.
I have made a tabular statement of his esti-
mates, to which I invite the attention of the
House:
Estimated receipts and disbursements of the Govern-
ment for the fiscal year ending June 30,1873, accord-
ing to Mr. Dawes.

This is the balance-sheet as presented by
the chairman of the Ways and Means. I will
not detain the committee in showing the
"guesses" contained in it, the assumptions as
to what may happen, but take it as it is, with
all "its imperfections on its head." I take
issue with the gentleman in his conclusions;
and in the basis of my calculation I do not
rely on mere assumptions and unwarranted
estimates. I propose to show that we shall
have all we require for an economical admin-
istration of the Government after deducting
about fifty million dollars from duties and
internal revenue, and then leave a much larger
balance than we should have in the Treasury.
I present to the House as the basis of my esti-
mate an official statement sent to me by the
Secretary of the Treasury, showing the actual
receipts from all sourccs received by the Treas-
ury down to the 1st of March. This does not,
of course, cover many of the reported items
which haye not yet been received into the
Treasury, which would increase the total.
That statement is as follows:
Tkeasury Department,
Washington, D. C., March 6,1872.
Sir : In compliance with the request mado in
your letter of tlie 2d instant. I have tho honor to
inclose herewith a statement showing the receipts
from customs and other sources, by warrants from
July 1 to December 31. 1871, and as reported but not
yet covered into the Treasury for the months of Jan-
uary and February, 1872.
Very respectfully,
GEO. S. BOUTWELL,
Secretary.
Hon. Fernando Wood, House of Representatives.

It will be thus seen that the aggregate sum
covered into the Treasury will be $250,508,-
888 59. This is for the first eight months of
the present fiscal year. The same ratio of
increase (it will be larger) for the remaining
four months of this fiscal year would produce
$125,254,944, and although the probabilities
are that it would be increased from" customs
revenue, but taking the present rate a total
income would inure to the Government of
$375,764,832 88. Of this sum there will be
about two hundred and twenty million dol-
lars in coin, which should produce a further
sum of about two and a quarter millions in
premiums.
Now, as to the expenditures : the Secre-
tary of the Treasury told us in his report sent
in with the President's annual message at
the commencement of this session, that he
would require $301,705,030 99. This includes
$28,000,000 for the sinking fund and estimates
for War and Navy, which should be largely
decreased. I have no doubt that a large de-
duction can be made. One has been intimated
here by the Committee on Commerce which
will decrease the appropriations for rivers
and harbors about eight million dollars. This
would leave a balance between the absolute
necessities and the almost certain receipts of
the Treasury of $82,059,795 89. When we add
to that amount the coin and currency which
the Secretary reports in the Treasury on the
1st of March, of $124,868,745, and part of
which is coin worth ten per cent, per annum
when changed into currency, but without add-
