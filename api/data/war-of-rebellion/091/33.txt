Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

There was considerable skirmishing along the lines at intervals yesterday, but nothing of any magnitude. An ambulance train was attacked between Charlestown and Berryville, and most of it captured. The indications are that there will be a general engagement this evening or in the morning. Our forces are on a line about two miles this side of Berryville, the enemy in their front. Shall report from time to time anything of importance that occurs.

Respectfully,

JOHN D. STEVENSON,

Brigadier-General.
