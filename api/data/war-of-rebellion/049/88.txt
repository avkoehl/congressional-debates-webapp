[AUGUST 21, 1863.]

Brigadier General H. M. NAGLEE,

Commanding District of Virginia:

I have just received a dispatch from General Halleck in which he says:

Reports from General Meade indicate that a part of Lee's force has moved toward Richmond. This may be a mere feint, or he may intend to trouble you.

Please to have things put in order in case Lee should make a move in this direction.

I would suggest the moving of the Mounted Rifles up the Peninsula to Williamsburg, to scout and obtain information, and also the sending of Spear's cavalry out toward or beyond the Blackwater for the same purpose.
