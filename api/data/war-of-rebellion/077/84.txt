Honorable J. A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War:

SIR: The memorandum I promised to make out for you is as follows: Giltner went to Kentucky with 1,640 men. His returns two days ago show (aggregate) 316 men. General Morgan started to Kentucky with (of his own command) about 800. Its present force is 292. It is reported that 50 recruits came from Kentucky three days ago. Vaughn has on the Watauga, of his own command, 656. Cosby's (Hodge's) brigade numbers now 287. Many are without arms, and most have had no cooking utensils for months. Eighteen or twenty pieces of artillery in the department, and only four guns horsed and equipped. An artillery major much needed.

Very respectfully,
