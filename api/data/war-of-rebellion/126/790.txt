Historical report of the disbursements in the Volunteer Recruiting Branch, Provost-Marshal-General's Bureau.

WAR DEPT., PROVOST-MARSHAL-GENERAL'S OFFICE, Washington, D. C., February 1, 1866.

Bvt. Major General JAMES B. FRY,

Provost-Marshal-General:

GENERAL: I have the honor to submit a historical report of the operations of this branch of your Bureau from its organization to January 1, 1866:

ORGANIZATION OF OFFICE.

The first appropriation for collecting, drilling, and organizing volunteers was made by Congress August 5, 1861, the disbursement of which was placed under the control and direction of the Adjutant-General of the Army, but the records do not show that any separate branch was established for the purpose of managing the disbursement of this fund until May, 1862,and the records of the office did not get fairly under way until the middle of June, 1862.

Lieutenant Colonel W. A. Nichols, assistant adjutant-general, was placed in charge at the opening of the office, and remained so until May 1, 1863 - the date upon which the recruitment of the volunteer forces was placed under your control - when he was relieved by Major O. D. Greene, assistant adjutant-general.

Major Greene was relieved by me August 26, 1863, since which time I have remained in charge of the office.

RECORDS.

At the opening of the office the record books prescribed by the regulations of the Adjutant-General's Department were established, but as the business of the office increased it became necessary from time to time to introduce other books of record, which will be described in their proper places hereafter, in connection with the subject-matter to which they appertain.
