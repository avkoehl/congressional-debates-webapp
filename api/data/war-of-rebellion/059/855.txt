HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF EAST TENNESSEE,Abingdon, April 30, 1864.

Brigadier General J. H. MORGAN,

Commanding Cavalry, Saltville:

GENERAL: I am directed by the major-general commanding to say that he wishes that portion of Giltner's brigade which lately formed Hodge's command to remain in the vicinity of Heyter's Gap, if he has not yet already moved. If it has moved, let the battalions be concentrated near the railroad, where corn can be furnished, and also in a locality which will afford pasturage. The officer in charge will notify these headquarters and Colonel Giltner of the position they may take.

The major-general commanding also directs me to say that, while he is anxious to mobilize you entire command as early as possible, yet the expedition he spoke with you of cannot be undertaken while threatened by a raid from the enemy, or at least while a portion of his cavalry is still absent.

Please issue the necessary orders to insure the concentration of Giltner's battalions,so that they can be paid and equipped. An officers goes to Richmond to-night to secure the articles needed.

I am, general, your obedient servant,

J. N. GALLEHER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
