Brigadier General WILLIAM D. WHIPPLE,

Chief of Staff, Army of the Cumberland:

GENERAL: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of you favor of this date, and am happy to state in reply that things here are working well. Our forces have captured the guns in the upper rebel battery on the river. There was another battery back from the river near the landing; I think the forces no shore and the Monitor silenced it, as we did not hear from it after dark. At dark I withdrew my boats, fearing they might by accident fire into our own men. I am just above the batteries to-night; will move at early daylight.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

LE ROY FITCH,

Lieutenant Commander, Commanding Tenth District, Mississippi Squadron.

I will move out and form, my left resting on your right.
