HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,April 25, 1865 - 1 p. m.

Major-General HALLECK:

I forward dispatches from the superintended Richmond and Danville Railroad, and my action thereon, which will explain themselves.* These were received and sent before your orders arrived. That order has been sent to Major-General Wright, with direction to govern himself accordingly. If the agents and employes of his company take in good faith the oath of allegiance, I should think, under existing orders and practice of this army, they could be employed with advantage to the interests of the Government, we retaining control of the road. The assistant superintendent has just arrived on his way to Richmond to see after his family. I have suggested his calling on you and getting your views.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,April 25, 1865 - 1.30 p. m.

Major-General HALLECK:

A soldier of Johnston's army has presented himself at these headquarters, asking to be paroled. Shall this man and others be paroled on the terms Army of Norther Virginia was paroled? If not, what course is to be pursued in such cases?

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.

RICHMOND, April 25, 1865 - 7.30 p. m.

Major-General MEADE:

Your views in regard to Danville railroad fully concurred in. You may parole all officers and soldiers of Johnston's army who surrender on the same terms as given to Lee's army. It must be understood, however, that those claiming homes in loyal States cannot return there without special permits and after taking oath of allegiance. At the present time public sentiment would not tolerate them.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General.
