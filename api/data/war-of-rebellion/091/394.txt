HDQRS. DEPARTMENT OF WASHINGTON, 22ND ARMY CORPS,October 17, 1864.

Major-General AUGUR,

Rectortown:

Mosby is reported, with 200 or 300 men, on or near Braddock road, south of Fairfax Station. Numbers probably exaggerated. This may account for Mosby's disappearance from your vicinity. Ludlam has been notified, and that portion of the First New Hampshire here marches to join him this evening. His line will be amply strong.

Respectfully,

J. H. TAYLOR,

Chief of Staff and Assistant Adjutant-General.
HDQRS. DEPARTMENT OF WASHINGTON, 22ND ARMY CORPS,October 17, 1864-8 p.m.

Major-General AUGUR,

Rectortown:

GENERAL: It is reported that Mosby has driven in Lazelle's pickets and is moving on Annandale and Fort Buffalo, camps of the Sixteenth and Thirteenth, with 600 men. The number must be exaggerated. Infantry has already moved from De Russy's line to Buffalo, and I have ordered Slough to send at once the Fifth Wisconsin to Annandale. I shall report such information as I receive.

Respectfully,

J. H. TAYLOR,

Chief of Staff and Assistant Adjutant-General.

BALTIMORE, October 17, 1864.

Major-General AUGUR:

In view of your telegram to General Tyler, can you, expedite the remounting and forwarding of the First Delaware Cavalry to General Tyler? It was sent yesterday to Washington to be remounted.

SAML. B. LAWRENCE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
