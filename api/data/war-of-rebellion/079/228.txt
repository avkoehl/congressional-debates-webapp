I renew my order to send to Rome all provisions at Allatoona and Cartersville, reserving at each place twenty days' supply; also all sick and wounded. Order all commanding officers to work on their defenses, so as to make them impregnable. The enemy has passed up WEST of Rome, and to-morrow I will ascertain if he has gone to venture into Tennessee, or merely is on a raid.
