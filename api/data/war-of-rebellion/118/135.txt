same ration and the substitution frequently of fresh vegetables for certain vegetable portions of the ordinary issue. From personal inspection and conversations with the prisoners I am satisfied their food is wholesome and abundant, and not a single instance in much questioning did I learn of a complaint either as to the quantity or quality of the food. The provisions are drawn from the commissary department in the usual manner and received by the two non- commissioned officers called stewards having under the provost- marshal the immediate care of the prisoners, who issue the provisions directly to the steward of the different messes. I call your attention to the paper inclosed marked C from he assistant commissary of subsistence at Camp Chase, whih gives in detail statements relating to the ration and the issue of vegetables.

The quarters of the prisoners are comfortably warmed and no restriction has been placed upon the quantity of fuel which each mess consumed, yet notwithstanding this there has been a considerable saving of fuel without an effort having been made so to do. The issue or allowance has invariably been the same as that permitted to the private soldier. I desire in relation to this matter to call your attention to the facts embraced in the paper inclosed marked D. Upon a personal examination of all the prisoners I found but exceedingly few of them, not exceeding four or five in number, who were not sufficiently clothed, and invariably with these the fault had been their own, as they had unto made application in any manner for clothing nor did they appear to care for it. The same substantially may be said of bedding, and upon inspection of all the blankets in the possession of the prisoners it was found to average two and two- sevenths blankets per man. I could learn of no complaints of cold. For confirmation of this please examine the report* marked E of the issues of clothing to prisoners. I will add that the officer having charge of the clothing informed me that in all cases upon the application of a prisoner for clothing it was given him if after a personal examination it was found that the articles called for were needed and that the clothing previously given the applicant had not been improperly disposed of.

As an index to the general health of the prison I inclose a copy of the hospital record of the prison from he 1st of November, and if the sickness and mortality be compared with that of the exterior camp I believe it will be found that proportionally its general health has been much better. From the accompanying paper* marked F it will be seen that the average number of sick was about eighteen, and this is the proportion of sick in a camp prison of nearly 300 inmates. The hospital is well supplied with wholesome food, cooking utensils, fuel, medicine and bedding. Of the latter there was in the hospital on the 17th ultimo the following amount: Fifty- nine calico comforts, 16 Government blankets, 23 straw ticks, 43 cotton sheets, 31 pillows, 38 pillow covers, and requisitions had been made on the 17th ultimo for an additional quantity of more than one- half this amount. The hospital at present contains but sixteen patients. The prisoners are supplied by the sutler with articles to the extent of the amount of their money deposited with the commanding officer. The supplies of the sutler seem to be proper and suitable, both in their variety and quality.

I desire to call your particular attention to the inclosure marked G relative to the disposition by Major Zinn of the sutler's tax amounting to $149. 20. He has permitted the post council first to tax the sutler, which should have been done by himself, and then has permitted this
