Morley, railroad superintendent in Alexandria. Bring forward your other brigade to-morrow, if possible. If you have not enough wagons and ambulances for your division, make requisition for what you need on the depot quartermaster. It has been reported that there was much disorder and drunkenness in the train of wagons of your First Brigade on the Little River turnpike. Do not allow any other trains to move without being in charge of a commissioned officer.

Captain MORLEY,Alexandria:

I thought to expedite the operations of the army by using the railroad, but as the men can march even in bad weather faster, it seems, than the road can carry them, I will tax it no further for the movement of troops. The remainder of General McCall's division will march here. So, see to it that forage and subsistence are sent forward as fast as required.
