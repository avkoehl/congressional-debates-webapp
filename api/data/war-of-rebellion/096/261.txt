My two regiments on the bank of the river suffered severely last night with the cold. Is it necessary for them to remain there, or will I order them to camp? I understand the enemy's boats have gone up the river.

What shall I say?

Yes; but have a few men thrown across there every night.

Colonel Evans reports that a battalion of the First New York Mounted Rifles was on the Charles City road at White's Tavern this morning. The enemy's pickets are there at their usual posts, and Mrs. White reports that there has been no one down as far her house for a week. Colonel West sent a scout last night and one this morning to the Charles City road, and reports that there were no traces of any movement on the road. Colonel Spear has a party out on the long Bridge road not heard from yet this morning. Captain Masten must have exaggerated the picket fires near White's Tavern last night.
