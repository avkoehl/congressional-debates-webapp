promotive of human happiness I say there is no
nation on the face of the earth tha' can boast of
such certain and remote antiquity, none can trace
instances of such early civilization, nor do any pos-
sess such irrefragable proofs of their origin, lineage,
and duration of language and government.
Before the introduction of Chr stianity, no peo-
ple of the globe better or more orderly maintained
their civil institutions, under Paganism, than did
the Irish. I believe the first mimst r of the cross
who visited Ireland was St Patrick, who was sent
by Celes'me, Bishop of Rome, with twemiy alist-
ante, eminent for their piety, virtue, and learning
Those divines applied them«elves with faithful as-
siduity, to the work of their mission and their suc-
cess, exceeded all human cak ulation at that time
In no land did the Gospel spread wuh such rapid
progress—m no land was it so slightly opposed at
its first introduction The people, savs a distin-
guished historian, received the doctrines of Chris-
tianity with a sort of spiritual violene , and no peo-
ple, from that day to this, adhere to the principies
of Christianity, as taught them, with more firmness
and resolute perseverance, than do the Irish But
with all their attachment to the Christian lehg on,
no people ever more resolutely and successfully
resisted the attempt of religious innovation up in
their civil rights But here a field of Irish history
opens which I have no time to traverse I can
only say that Ireland was betrayed to Henry II
of England by the infamy of Dermot, though she
has never been conquered to this day.
Ireland has never kissed the English rod. She
withstood the arms, the babes, and the opprcs
Sions of England, trom the nominal  ubitction to
Henry II, till the union of the two Kingdom —a
period of near four hundred years Prior to that,
every attempt at reducti n or subjection was met
on the held of Wood. The farthest innovation of
the British arms or color of subjection, did not
extend beyond the pale—which wa* limited to the
counties of Dublin, Kildare, and Meath, wiih
the cities ot Watt rford, Cork, and L mer ck,
over the other parts oi the Kingdom which \ ero
■without the pale, neither Henry II, nor any of his
successors, until the reign of James I, either had,
or pretended to cl-tim, more th in a naked sove
leiguty, marked akne by a formal homage, a
trifling tribute, and an empty tule And what now
is the union, or what is it worth? T i be sure, it is
a political union that serves to oppress Ireland,
but it is no union of friendship, helmg, or nation-
al ties. The true and patriotic Irishman biars,
in every feeling he possesses, the same hostility
to the EngUsh notion, her Goveromtnt, and her
laws, which burned in the bosoms cf hi-t ancestors,
■when their country was treachetously sunendered
by the infamous Dermod Eveiy true Irishman
transmits to his posterity the seeds of tb«if hosu
lily  which will, some day, overwhelm the op-
pressor, and redeem Ireland The aim of Bniish
oppression, undt r which Ireland now groans, will
be paralyztd by the abuse of the corrupt means by
which it gained its power |The Irish mind is like
spring steel—it may be borne down by the weight
of oppression, but no lime nor no tyranny can de
stroy its nature Pile Irish spirit may, for a time,
be smothered, but it will, eventually, burst mm
flames. It is impossible J or a land like thn of
Ireland, destined by its Creator to be ihe abode of
freedom and happiness, always to rema n the land
of oppression and misery Fear not, Irishmen' the
sleeping lion will cme day awake, Ireland will one
day be free
Sir, thete is no people for whom I entertain a
higher feeling of personal and national respect, than
for the Irish, and I feel that lhat respect is well
founded—I have hmh and undoubted authority fir
it The history of the Irish nation, and the quail
ties of the Irishman, unite in fixing lhat opinion
with me Thfir atiachmenis to the principles of
Democracy, which no influence can shake, or
bribery seduce,""must fix upon them the confidence
of every friend to our free nititu'inn , and so
thought our ancesttrs. I hold in my hand the
journals of the Continental Congre s From them
I will read a short extract of an address to Ireland,
by a committee of Congress for lhat purpove I
jread it, and shall make it a part of my printed re
marks, in order to place the views and feelings of
our gallant ancestors towards the Insti, in contrast
wuh the stand now taken agairst them and  the
Germans by the Federal popirjay shinplaster ans
tocracy of this day.    Htre is ihe extract
' Permit me to assure you that it was with the utmost reluc-
ía cc we could ptevail ourselves to cease our commercial con
nection with your island Your pirliament had done us no
wrong You had ever been friendly to the rights of mankind
and we acknowledge with pleasure and giatitude that your na
«on has produced patriots who have nobly distinguished them
selves in the cause of humanity and America On the other
hand, we were not ignorant that the labor and manufactures of
Ireland, like those of the silk worm were of little moment to
herself but berved only to give luxury to those who neither
toil nor spin We perceived that if wc continued our com
merce with you our agreement not to import fiom Blltam
would be fruitless and were therefore compelled to adopt a
measure to which nothing but absolute necessity could have re
conciledus It gate its however some consolanon to lejlect

What objects had the venerable patnols of the
Revolution when they expressed this high opm on
ot ihe Irish, and extended this pressing invitation
to them to flee from that otpression which v. as
crushing them to the dust, and sinking them to the
grave? Was it their intention that they shculd be
made beasts of burthen to do the "labor," as Gov.
Seward says, and as Federalism says, or was it
their intention lhat they should be freemen and
American citizens? Was it their intention to se-
duce the Irish here to spill th( ir bio )d m the Revo-
lution, and when liber) should be seemed, cast
Iheoi and then countrymen aft>r them off as ur-
wonhy of the benefits and blessings which that blood
should purchase? Tne thought is monstrous, ,ind
to name it is infamous slandei
But, sir, there is a question of policy, mdep ndmt
of the motives of patriotism and gratitude, which
makes it important to extend to our In h and
Gtrmin popuhpon at an eirlv period and at a
cheap rate tin- lights of cituenship I repeat
lhat the supptrt which tur Democratic prm
ciples and our lne instiutu ions íeceive at
their hand, con.titutes a h sh guanniee for
their duration It is the dictate ot good polic ,
wit1 out any othet consideration, to admit them to
the full benefits ol our freemstilu ton1, while a de-
nial of them would mark us as a people o< a selfi h
and jealous disposition, unworthy ot a great and
growing Repuolic That national jealousy ind
selfishness winch prohibits foreigners from a parti-
cipation in legal and political benefits is worthy of
despotism, or of narrow and petty Repuolics, and
rarely evet fails to produce their evils It is ever
so with restrictions, when canned be>ond Ihe bounds
of good or liberal policy For the truth of which,
we may refer to the history of many national dis-
asters, and from which the wise and the expe-
rienced may draw many useful le  ons
The Assyrians repudiated the Babylonians, re
fused ÚVm the protection of Iheir laws, and even
admission «to their empire, by which they de-
prived themselves of many useful maxims, as well
as the improvement in arms of national defence
and their practical use. The Babylonians rejected
the improvements, learning, and language of the
Medes and Persians, and the MeJes and Persians
those of the Macedonians, and the Macedonians
those of the Romans And yet the empire cf As
sjna r"ade way for the Babylonians, the Babylo
mans were conquered and sjoducd by the Mede-
and Persian", the Medes and Ptr íans were over-
thrown by the Macdomns, ancj tne Macedonians
by the Romans Thete is little doubt but that the
overthrow of each of t'iose empii°s may be raced,
to some extent, to causes wh ch had their founda-
tion in Ihit jeilousy and sojfi ¡mess which induced
the one to prohibit the o n' r from a participation m
its political institutions
It was the same mise ab • , nanow poiicv which
was marked, too, by a haughty pride, that induced
the citizons and policy of CWtlMsje in her degene-
rate day, to reject not only ihe Grecian manners,
customs, language, and arts of war from oemg
taugt-t in their dominions, bul even to prohibit a
Grecian from settling on their sod for want of the
benefits and advantages of all which, Carthage
sunk a victim to the Roman arms, but Rome her-
self, in her degenerate days, ''ell into the same fatal
error.   When Rome was m the zenith of her pros-
perity, and the heignt of her real grandeur, it was
her general policy to admit the nations she con-
quered to the rights of Roman citizens, or to extend
her laws, her maxims, and her political institutions
ever dominions that gave way to her arms    It
was not until after she had suuk into Eastern effe-
minacy and Eastern vices, produced by unresiramed
indulgence in Eastern luxuries, purchased at the
sacrifice of her revenue w bich should have sup-
ported and maintained her national defencs on her
frontiers, that she substituted  tt e amphitheatre of
poit and unbiidled licentiousness for the forum of
virtue, political science, and natK nal intelligence.
Then it was that she treated the sabdued and con-
quered vie i H    of her  arms   as barbarous, un-
woi thy of i ei   protection, sacrifice 1   them to the
spott of men1    depravitv, by casting them into
!he/íí to  b  torn to pieces by wi'd «md ferocious
blasts,   and    traired    them    as    gladiators   for
Ihe  destruction of each other to gratify the de-
generate   and   corrupted   aDpetite   of assembled
thousands    Then it was that  Rime, whose stand
ard   had bene  her   eaglt s   over  the   civilized
globe, whose aims  and whoi-e laws and maxims
had supplanted ihe nations of the earth, fell a prey
to ard became the pillage,  the plurder and the
spoils of a few halt natted untaught bands of bar-
barians    So we may tiace among the causes to
which Rome owed her overthrow, that of the bar-
barous and worse than brutal treatment of those
whom it was  her policy and her duty to have
protected and defended, and made Roman citizens
I have stited that m the formation of our Go-
venment some tf  our institution's were framed
with reference to some of the p A tical institutions
of ihe couniry frtm whicn we were emancipated

h?d thur mftuei ce   I believe it was m the reign
of Hem y the E gMh ihat ihe Pope's bulls and eccle-
siastical  processions were prohtbitei the  realm of
Enghnd, and t e Protectant church made  inde-
pendent of the church of Rome     At   the same
ti ne the  King was made head  of the chunh  m
place of   the   Pope     But perhips th s st oke at
the Pope did not so much proceed from hostility to
tne Roman Catín lie faith, as from a determination
to ahohsh his  influente, and   the power of   ihe
Roman   church, over    the   civil   institutions   of
Englan)      At   lhat  time   the   arms   of   Challes
the Fifth, Emperor   of  Germany, was   shaking
evsry   throne    in    Europe      Charles    himself
was    wedded,     in     principle     and   poLcy,    to
the  Roman  church,   and it was   not   more   his
tbject to rubject all Europe to the imperial crown,
than it wis to nak-> the Roman Catholic faith the
national reí gi n wherever his arm? extended     It
is, therefore, ne.ther unfair nor unreasonable to
snppos   that a leading  object wuh   Henry the
Eighth, m overthrowing the Catholic faith and abo-
lishing the Pope's power in the realm of England,
was to undo to his own powr the influence of the
Lutheran refo mation again ' the combination of
the arms of Charles and tho ecclesiastical influ-
ence, as well as the arm , of the Pope    Bat the
stand taken bv Henry did not stop with denouncing
the Pope, and rejecting his ecclesiastical supremacy,
and the Roman Cathode faith as the national reli-
gion     h became for a time the policy, not only of
Henry, but many ot his successors, to deny to the
Rora^n Cattiolic ci'izen  not only the right to hold
office, to acquire and hold p-operty,  but even  the
benef t of the Iaws, to son e extent, for his personal
security      Not verv  creditable prohibitions,   we
would say, at this day     Bat it was not merely the
Roman Catooltc and the Roman Catholic faith that
met with a repuls" in  England,  other rengious
denominationa, through whom nothing fatal to the
mteiests of the Sta'e vat  to b? feared, met with
treatment  but little more favorable     For many
ages the Jew  were compelled  to purchase reli-
gious privileges at an enormous expense    Under
th" reign of Henry the Second, and the beginning
of the reign of Edward the Third, the Jews paid to
t,io->e monarths in le s than seven years the almost
incredible (at that time) sum of more than four
hundred and twenty thousand pounds sterling for
no other consideration than the rights of conscience
