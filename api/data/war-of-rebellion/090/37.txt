NEWTOWN, VA., November 15, 1864 - 12.30 a. m.

Early's army did not stop at Fisher's Hill, but continued its retreat during the night of the 12th back to New Market. From the reports of prisoners and citizens the army was stampeded by the attack of our cavalry on his extreme flanks. I regret that I could not get sufficient positive information of Early's presence, but all the prisoners captured early in the day were cavalrymen and were positive that no infantry had come this way. This incorrect information was true so far as they knew, as they had traveled on the side roads and could not see any of the infantry. Citizens report John Morgan's cavalry, about 1,200 strong, as the only organized re-enforcement that Early has received, but that the army had been increased by conscripts, detailed men, and men of the second class - farmers. They report Early's army very much increased in numbers.
