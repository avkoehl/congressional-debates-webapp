habns ot idleness and dishoneMv, vice and profli-
gacy. Ha spoke ot them as a clas-s, but admittel
there were soma creditable exceptions Mr C
added that the Senator from Kentucky might be
very sincere in the objection he ha 1 nisei, but, if
so, he diffeied very widely from many of hi* po-
litical trien's, who would iloubtless not only grant
pre-emptions, but make dona'ions of land t > ' free
negroes,' and emane pate out slaves to increase the
Dumber ot their beneficiaries.
Mr C remarked that ih<  course pursued by the
Senator from Kentucky see ne I to him objection-
able in ano her aspect. The bill has been en-
grossed, and is now on it  third reading, and the
Senator moves a recommitment to the same com-
mittee by whom it was reported, wi h ins rucuons
to amend or change it in several particulars Mr.
C contended that this course was unusual and un-
fair, under the circumstances He said the gentle-
man was present when the bill was before the Se-
nate as in committee of the whole, and when it
was open to amendment. Why did he not then
state his objections, and propose his amendments'?
This bill had been among tne first introduced at
the present session, had been printed, and on the
files of the Senate tor more than three months, of
coarse its provisions must have been known,
and fully understood by every member It
such amendments as are now proposed had
been offered at the proper «taee, it would
have occasioned no delay, they could at
ouee have been adopted or rejected But, instead
of meeting a measure, to which the Senator has
always been and still is opposed, in this fair, open,
and usual mode, he awaits its engrossment and
third reading, and then moves us recommitment,
which must be followed by delay, and pos thly de-
lea', for want of time for action in the other Hou*e
He submitted it to the Senate whether they would
sanction this mode ot opposition
Mr. C. remarked that there was something
straage, and, to his mind, unaccountab'e, m the
course the Senator from Kentucky had pursut-d on
this, and all similar occasions, m íelerence to the
interest' of the new States, (or the las ti^ht years
He had umformiy opposed, with the most perse-
vering and untiring he utility, every attempt t> srant
pre-emption r ghis to settlers—ever} pre position to
graduate the price of the public lands, or reduce
the most inferior pine barrens, ii,cky moun'ams,
swamps, or marshes, bdow the price of the most
ferti'e and valuable low grounds of the Miosis
sippi or Red river- in a word, he had not only op-
posed those more important measures, but every
bill which 'ended to relax cr mitigate the land sys
tern, in us operat on upon the m ere-t, happiness, or
prosperity < t the new States. The journals ot the
Senate and the newspapers of the day would (Mr.
C. said) bear him out in the correctness of what
he had said. Yet, (said Mr. C ) wha' has been
the couise pursued by the Senator from Kentucky,
m the m^an time, toward-, the othsr Sia'p^ To
pass by h * more general mesure, to divide (ut
the new States amongst the i Id one—commonly
called his distribution bill—by which (to siy no-
thing of otaer objections at present) he would have
interested all the o'd States, by annual receip's (rom
the proceeds of the public landi, in keeping up
their price, until the neceas ties of the increasing
population of the new ones cornpe led them to
purchase on any terms, and eniorcing the yr nci-
ples of the present sy tem, with unmitigated rig ir,
even to die extent t f driving off thp seitlers by mi-
litary fore: notwuhstandihg all th s lllib-rJuy,
and even barshnfS>, towards the people of the new
Sta'es, we find the Senate r frrm Kei tacky, at the
last session, vot ng for a bill that w.>s to opera e in
another quarter, which fully embraced, and sanc-
tioned, both" the principles of the pre-emption p i-
vilege and graduation ' Yes, sir, the Senator fam
Kentucky, at ihe last se'sioti, after his lonj and
implacable hostility to bo h tho-e punciples, so fir
as the new States were concerned, vited for a bill
to cede to the State of Tennessee "all the right,
title, claim, and interest, which the United S ates
have, in and to the vacant, unppropnated, ant le-
fuse lands, south and west ol the Congressional re-
servation Une," in that State, upon certain "condi-
li
tions and limitation  "    Amongst those conditions
and   limitations were the following:
"Inselling, entering, and disposme, of said lands all and
e\erv peisonor persons, the legal representative of such per
son or persons, and the rightful assignee of such \ erson or per
sons asare entitled to the right of t ccupancv and pie emption
iccirdmg to the laweot the s,tate of Tenn ssee shall have the
pieference in entering purchas ne, or obtaining grants fortheir
occupant and pie emption rights at the price ol tweive anda
half cents per acrefir said ocupant and preemption rights,
not exceeding two hundred acres each
Yes, sir, th? Senator from Kentucky voied for
this bill, which carries the privilege of pre emp
tion, wh,chhe has hitherto, ard still denounces with
so much virulence, and opposes so inexorably,
farther than any measure, which has ever been
passed, or attempted for the new States, and car-
ries the reduction of price lower thnn any of our
graduation bills The part of the bul I have quoted,
not only enjoins upon the Legislature to give the
preference to all who " are entnled to the right of
occupancy and pre-emption, according to the laws
of the State of Tennessee," that is, to every body
residing upon the land, but to "the legal representa-
tive," and " the rightful assignee ot such person or
persons." Now, sir, so carefully have all our pre-
emption laws guarded against the possibility of
fraud and speculation, that all right of assignment
or representation has been absolutely cut off and
denied. The pre-emption law of the 29th May,
1830, contained this positive enactment-
' And that all as^ismrients and transfers of the right of pre
emption given by this act, prior to the issuance ol patents, shall
be mil and void  '
Mr C said the samp provision had been re-
vived and continued in every subsequent pre-emp-
t on law, and would be by this, if it passed. So
much afraid of fraud and speculation were the ene-
mies of the new States, that no pre-emption bill,
h* presumed, could be passed for them without
such a clause. In them it was merely and sli icily
a personal matter—there could be no assignments,
nor could any heir claim in the name of an unfor-
tunate deceased ancestor Yet, in Tennessee, it
could be made inheritable anil transferable, as
broadly as any other leeal right, and that by the
Senator's vote. So, the utmost that a settler, in a
new S'ate, could get, was one quarter section, and
if there happened to be more than one settlor upon
it, it must be divided into as many ^harec, but in
Tennessee two hundied acres could be g ven.
And, instead of giving a dollar and a quarter per
acre, as the pre emptors of the new States aie
bound to pay, a settler in Tennessee is permitted to
buy at twelve and a half cents per acre—the one-
S'xth part of the lowest price at which we can be
permitte 1 to pa^s a b 11 for the most infer or
lands m the new States. He appealed to the
Seriate to say whether this was fair and equal
jus'ice7 Were the citizens of Alabama and Mis-
sissippi, and the other new States, less meritorious,
le s honorable, or le s patriotic, than those of Tf n
nessee? Had not those ¡s'ta es been "admitted into
the Union on an equal fottng with tne original
States, in all respects whatever? ' Or, was this dr-
en ation of the terms of their admission mere
mt ckery1 Sir, said Mr. C to rec< ncile the con-
sistency of the=e contradictory vot°s of the Senator
from Kentucky is ímprssi^e, un'ey-, he can prove
that poor land in Indiana, or I iinois, or Alabama,
or Mics ssippi, is worth a d< liar and a quarter per
arre, when the same quality in Tennessee is worth
but twelve and a half cents per acre He must go
farther, and prove that it is lawful and meritorious
to settle upon an 1 improve public lai d in Tenn s-
see, while it is un'awful and criminal to do the
sime thing in ihe other Slates Mr C. said hedii
ne t complain of the Senator's vote for the Tennes
s«e bill, he hid voted for it himself, and would
cheerlullydo it agun; but he complained that he
denied the people of the n'w States the rights and
privilegs which he acorded to others
Mr C conclude 1 by expressing the hope, that the
bill under consideration would receive the sane ion
of a majority of the Senate, as o hers of similar
character had heretofore done, notwithstanding the
opposition it had encountered
After some remarks from Mr WALKER,
Mr. CLAY of Kentucky moved to ren mmit
th  bill with instructions; which was negatived—
ayes 8, noes 25.

REMARKS OF MR. NORVELL,
Or MICHIG \N
In Senate, Jpnl 18, 1840—On the bill allowing ra-
tions to General Wool and Colonel Croghan
Inspectots General of the Army
Mr NORVELL sad, that th s bill, as he now
understood Irom both its fnend  and its adversa-
ries, proposed to allow the Insjectors General rf
the Arm> ot ire Unit d State*, for eight rr nine
}ears before 1833, dtuble tatuns, whici, under the
sime law, ha been allowed to then since that
year; and hid, under th* liw, been allowed to
utl er staff cffijtr, before that penod. This discre-
I ancy appeared to have been the resu't of the dif-
ferent interpre'ations put, at different times, by
different heads tf the War Department, up< n the
act of Congress 'elating to the subject The In-
spectors General were now re-il z tig the benefit ul
he double ratirns, at d what the bill con-
templated was the allowance of the arrearages
of double rations from the passage of the law to
the time when the pre ent int rpretation of it* pro-
visions commenced The b II ts'abhshed no neff
principle It-s liberality had, from >ts passage,
been extended to other efficers similarly situated
And, for himself, when a cHim so strong, in favor
of two such gallant officers as the pie ent Inspec-
tors General of he Army, was pre ented to h s feel-
ings and ju gment, he could not hesitate as to tne
course which he should pursue.   Sir, who is it that
