GENERAL: The negro who has given us valuable information, of whom I spoke, I send by the bearer of this. He has some information, and as General Meade told me he would have him paid should he obtain any valuable information I send him to you. He says the enemy are about to advance their lines on the Gurley house and Gary's Church road. As I cannot have my command relieved before 6 p.m., and Colonel Devin says it took him five hours to come here, with this information from the negro, and the deserter yesterday to the same effect, I will not leave Colonel Devin's camp till early to-morrow morning, unless I receive further orders.
