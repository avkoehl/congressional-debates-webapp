Report of the Postmmter General.
S«!*4íe fe Ho. of Rem,
Bounding- party under the command of Lieutenant
Gedncyf The price of this vessel, ($3,350,) there-
fore, could no  be charged to the naval appropria-
tions—it was properly charged to the appropria-
tions for the coast survey. For the same reason
the boats, equipments, and other expenses for the
schooner, amounting to $1,888 60, were charged
to the same appropriation,as was also the charge
for extra pay to the officers, amounting to $650;
in all, for the year 1834, to $5,888 60.
During the present season, the expense of thiB
schooner chargeable to the coast survey has
amounted to $1,398, making the whole expense
of this schooner for years 1834 arid 1835 charge-
able to the coast survey, amount to $7,287 60.
It is not probable that the expense of this
schooner, chargeable to the coast survey appro-
priation, will, for the next year, exceed $1,500.
The schooner Experiment, employedf by the
sounding party under Lieutenant Blake, belongs
to the Navy. The coast survey appropriation
has therefore been charged only for equipments
which were not necessary for the purposes of the
Navy. These, with other expenses attending
the operations of the sounding party on boara
this schooner, from the first of July last, when
site was sent upon the survey, to the 30th of
September last, amounted to $2,517 73.
, As most of the equipments of these schooners
will last for several years, with but little expense
for repairs and supply of articles which may be
lost by accident, it is believed that the expense
of both schooners and the sounding parties on
board of them for the next year, chargeable to
the coast survey, will not exceed $4,000.
It wilt be seen that this differs widely from the
statement of Mr. Hassler, which may be ex-
plained by the circumstance that he did not derive
nis information from the books of the Treasury
Department.
By a statement hereunto annexed, marked P,
it appears that of the appropriations heretofore
made for the suppression of the slave trade, there
remains in the Treasury a balance of thirteen
thousand four hundred and eighty-nine dollars
And fifty-five cents.
In my last report, I took the liberty of stating
that some of the clerks in my Department did not
receive salaries proportioned to their services, or
adequate to the decent support of themselves and
families; and I respectfully solicited that the sala-
ries, particularly of the chief clerk of the Navy
Board, the warrant clerk, and the clerk keeping
the register of correspondence of this Department,
■whose duties-are arduous, requiring both talent
and experience, should be increased, so that the
first might receive $1,700 per annum, arid the
others $1,400 each., I repeat the solicitation,
from a thorough conviction that their faithful ser-
vices fully merit this increase of compensation.
The superintendent of the southwest Executive
building receives but-$250 per annum for his ser-
Tices, which it is believed is a compensation too
small to command the services of one competent
to perform the duties of the station.
The sergeants acting as clerks to the command-
ant and atari" officers of the marine corps, are
"paid at the rate of less than $700 a year for all
'their services, which it is respectfully suggested
is not an adequate compensation.
The necessary references to papers and doc-
umenta connected with this report, will be found
in a schedule hereunto annexed.
All of which is respectfully submitted.

;         Report of the Postmaster Gen e««X-
Post Office Department  1st December, 1S35.
Totkt PreslieM of tkt United States:
'   Si*: During the year ending 30th June, 1835, '
the postfoutes of* the United States covered "about
one hundred and twelve thousand seven hundred ,
and seventy-four miles.                                          I
In daily and less freq'trent trips, the mails vert ,
carried on these routes about 25,869,486 miles, '
'viz:               ^      _                                                  i
1(3,874,050 miles in four-horse post-coaches and
two-horse stages;
" 7¡8I7jí7Sf miles on horses and in suffceys;
'9ift6,95$    4i    in steamboats;
*^ ,Wt'  **■' in tailroad cars.'   *'*-      "
The number of post ornees on the 30th June
last, was ten thousand seven hundred and sev-
enty, being an increase of fifty-four within the
preceding year.
The system upon which the books of the De-
partment have always been kept, precludes an
exact statement of the revenue and expenditure
which have accrued within any given period.
The following is believed to approximate nearly
to the actual income and accruing responsibilities
for the last two fiscal years, viz:
Gross revenue for the year ending 30th June,
1834..........................j>2,823,749 34
Compensation to post-
masters............$897,317 29
Incidental expenses....     87,744 27

Transportation  of  the
mails..............1,719,007 32
Total expenditure..............2,757,350 06
Balance in favor of the Department. .$235,206 58
In the first part of the year 1835, additional al-
lowances were authorized, as is alleged, amount-
ing on the 1st of May last to about $157,000,
which have since been suspended, and do not
enter into the foregoing statement. If finally ad-
mitted:; they will reduce the balance in the favor
Of the Department that year to about $79.000.
The old books will be closed when all the pe-
cuniary transactions of the Department, prior to
the first of July last, are brought up on them.
Statements made out from these books, and other
data, show the condition of the Department on
that day, to have been about as follows, viz:
Due to contractors and others......$792,381 92
Due to banks....................   272,000 00
"Whole debt of the Department... .$1,064,361 92

Department.....41,128,319 29
Deduct for bad  and
doubtful debts-----     131,327 36
Debt esteemed to be
good............. «996,991 93
Cask on hand......      43,689 40
Whole available means..........$1,040,681 33
Balance  of   debt   over   available
means on 1st July last.....„...      $23,700 59
If the   suspended allowances be
added...,....................      157,000 00
It will make the debt exceed the
available means on 1st July last.    % 180,700 59
The aceouats-of the Postmasters for the quar-
ter ending the 30th of September last, have been
so far examined as to show, satisfactorily, that
the increase of gross revenue over that erf the
corresponding quarter of last year, is about
twelve per cent. The annual saving in the rer
cent letting of contracts was about $30,000.
Predicated on an average increase of revenue
throughout the current fiscal year of ten per cent.,
and on a saving of $25,000 when the contracts
recently let shall be executed with necessary al-
terations, an estimate ef the gross revBnne and
accruing responsibilities for the year ending30th
June, 1836, indicates the following results, viz:
Gross revenue for the rear ending 30th June,
1836................"..........$3,296,692 09
Compensation to post-
masters...........f 1,039,958 00
Incidental expenses..      70,000 00
Transportation of the
mails..............1,706,507 00
Total expendrtores..,............2,816,465 00
Balance in favor of the Department   $476,227 00
' AHbotig* the whole of this sum may not be
arailable, on account of the- usual losses and d*-
falcations, it i  not dowbted that, aided by col-
lections of outstanding balances, it will be suffi-
cient to pay off the" debts of the Department, and
leave a considerable amount applicable to an ex-
tension of mail accommodations.
When the undersigned took charge of this
Department, his attention was immediately called
to the condition of its finances; but it was soon
found that no satisfactory account of its debts
or its means could, within any short period,
be obtained from its books. It was only per-
ceived, from current incidents and detached ac-
counts, that the unsatisfied demands of contract-
ors from every quarter of the country, were
daily accumulating; that there was a debt of
near $300,000 due to banks; that the outstand-
ing acceptances of the Treasurer exceeded
$190,000; that a considerable portion of the
revenue of some of the large offices, for the pres-
ent calendar year, had been anticipated by drafts
discounted in banks, which they had been in-
structed to pay at maturity; that additional al-
lowances had been recently authorized to a
considerable amount; that to provide means to
meet the demands on the Department at Wash-
ington, created by the system of acceptances,
Upwards of two thousand of the most consider-
able post offices had been directed to deposit
their income in banks; and that these means
proving in sufficient, the Department was sub-
jected to continual embarrassments in devising;
ways and means to meet its engagements. At
the same time, it was believed on all hands that
the current revenue of the Department consider-
ably exceeded its current expenditure, and that
the aggregate of debt was in progress of diminu-
tion. In this state of things, it was deemed
expedient to make an effort to extricate the
Department from its embarrassments. The
measures resorted to for that purpose were as
follows, viz:
1.  A suspension of all recent allowances from
the credit of the contractors.
2.  A refusal to accept or pay any drafts drawn
on the Department, except by special'arrange-
ment.
3.  The application of the income of the current
quarter ,to the .payinent of that quarter's ex-
penses, the Surplus only to be applied to the
payment of preexisting elairns.
4.  The introduction of a system which should
efleet a more prompt^ollection and application of
the current income of the Department.
The allowances suspended amounted to about
$157,000. Without reference to their merits, it
was believed that a preference ought to be' given
to other claims in making payments.
The discontinuance of acceptances was essen-
tial to enable the Department to command its
means. A revenue arises wherever the mails'are
carried; and it would seem obviously appropri-
ate, as well as convenient, that the services of
contractors should be paid for in the sections «if
country where they are rendered, and, as far tip
practicable, out of the income which they pro-
duce. But the practice of suffering the contract-
ors to draw for their pay subjected the Depart-
ment (q the inconvenience of collecting its funds
from the posl offices throughout the Union, and
transferring/ thenr to Washington, to meet the
drafts. The slowness and uncertainty of this
operation made it an insufficient reliance to meet
its acceptances, produced the necessity of look-
ing elsewhere ibr the means, and rendered ft
difficult to manage its finances with any conve-
nienoe or regularity.
By paying the expenses of the current quarter
at its dose, and announcing a determination to
pay in like manner at the close of each succeed-
ing one, applying only the surplus to the discharge
of former debts, it was believed that the credit of
the Department would immediately be elevated
and thenceforward sustained.
Orders to deposit in banks and drafts on post-
masters in favor of contractors, constituted the
system of collection found in operation. Upwards
of two thousand post offices had orders to deposit,
and upwards of eight thousand were instructed
to retain their postages until drawn Upon. Many
of the deposit offices were dilatory, and defalca-
tion among them was not uncommon.   Many
