2.7th Cong.......1st Sess.___________________Case of McLeod—Mr. Ingersoll.                                                      H. of Reps
ly   eminent   in    the    Senate    of   the   United
States, be  was for the first time called to take
a critical first step in  an Executive depa'tmtnt.
I mean nothing offensive to that gentleman when
I say that he was not only new in his place, but
green m his  place.    He was the first American
Secretary of State who went at once from the bar
to that Department, without ihe least exp nence
as an executive officer—wholly unversed in all the
ways of diplomacy—and, however well read in in-
ternational law, inexpert  in the usages, methods,
habits, and feelings of that intercourse,   which,
both as respects men and nations, characterizes
their foreign relations     I assert, sir, that his first
step was a terrible mistake,  that he miste ok the
high road to peace, and stumbled on the threshold,
into what endangers a cold-blooded, interminable,
useless, and almost causeless war.    Taken in con-
nection with  all the cc'ual circumstarces of the
case,  the tone of the British press., both  m Eng-
land  and Canada,   the language of members m
both Houce  of Parliament, and the palpable terms
of Mr Fox's letter itseif, it is impossible, I think,
not to see we  cannot   wink  «o  hard as not to
perceive that Mr Fox's is a threatening letter    It
surprises me that this should have been a subject
of controversy m another part of this buildin ,
while I cannot doubt that Mr. Webster was per-
fectly satisfied of the menacing aspect of the first
letter he received from the Bntich Minister.  Anx-
ious—perhaps laudably anxious—to avcid a quar-
rel so very unpromising, at the very outset of a
new Administration, he seems to have shut his
eyes to what must flash in every American face
And here was his first mistake, for his course was
perfectly plain.   He had nothing to do but, by an
answer m the blandest terms of diplomatic courte
sy, to send back the questionab'e ph^e* to Mr
Fox, with a respectful suggest.on lhat they looked
to him as if conveying a threat, that he hoped not,
he believed not; he  trusted, fir the harmony of
their personal relations,  end the peace of iheir
respective   nations,   that   he   was  labirmg un-
der a mistake; but he could not divest hi  mind ( f
the impression, that there were m this note ot Mr
Fox, certain  phrases which, in all controve1 síes
among gentlemen  as well as nations,  inevitably
put an end to further negotiation.    Mr Fox must
have answered  negatively or affirmatively, ¿nd
the odious indignity which now  rankles   in  the
breast of at least a  large proportion of the coun
try, mterpietmg it as the meaning of the  British
communication, would have been  avoided    Mr
Webster had Mr. Fox absolutely m the hollow of
his hand     He hadan opportunity of enhstmg the
manly feeling of all hi= countrymen, the good will
of right-minded  Englishmen themselves, to anrm
and inoffensive  stand like thi-, on the threshold of
the correspondence     Why he did  not, is not for
me to imagine.    With i o feeling of personal dis-
paragement to that gent'ernan, I charge th s as an
obvious, a capita', and a deplorable lapse trom
the position he should have assumed, m his veiy
first attitude towards the Bntis'a Minister
Instead of this, with a prscipitauon whici I can-
not think the alleged urgen-y of circumstances by
no means called for, turning aside from his an-
tagonist, and evidently demoralized by the force of
his attack, he went forthwith to work upon a chap-
ter of instructions *o the Attorney General ot the
United Sta'es, cons ltutmg an episode to lbs g-ar *
epie in every stage of i1, marked by unc ns.iu-
tional and unwarrantable procedure* By the
eulogium on the late i lustnous Prts dent, pro-
nounced by his distinguished fellow sol her, the
American Murster m Paris, wiich was read the
other day n this hall, it ppp=ars that the present
Attorney General of the Un.ted States, disungu shed
as a lawyer and a statesman, served a'-o wi h
Ciedit at the battle of the Thames. W ether fir
the military or civil expenejee of th>s gent'enan,
or for both, it might be difficult to determine, hjt
the Secretary ot State, instead of answering th?
Bn ish Minister at all, immediately cnli te 1
him, together with a military general whee laurels
flourish on every spot m the neighborhood ot the
scene to which this couple of generals were de
spatched by the Secretary of State, so that he could
hardly put his foot down without treading on his
own trophies, and sent them as fast as possible to
the v.llage tn Western New York, which was to
be the theatre of their joint exploits. I am afraid,
sir, that it is somewhat transparent through the in
^tractions of the Secretary, that much of his appre-
hens'tn in this precipitate movement rested on the
goo i people of Lockport, who had been charged by
the Britiih press with that Hve'y sympathy tor the
due enforcement of the law; which, m my humble
opinion, was by no means discreditable to
their feelings The generals were to change
the venue, to overlook, I presume, the pro-
ceedings of the court of quart r session?, and
generally to manifest ftat anxiety to propitiate
British good will, and forfend British animosity,
wh ch is so very apparent to be extremely cha-
racteristic of but too iMany Amencans I hive not
been able to see, Mr. Srieaker, th" published pro-
ceedings of the various branches ef the Govern-
ment of New York on this ocasión, bat I am
given to under ¡and that those Doih of the Gover-
nor and the Legislature, are such as do fie-n
h *nor, and maintain the charac er and interest- 
of that noble Commonwealth. Th°y indicate the
right way to p-ae , the very opposite way from
that taken by the Secretary of State, to which my
greatest objection is, that it is the hnrh rod s>nd
down bill descent to cold b'ooded hostilities
What right, *ir, had the Executive of tne Nauo"al
Government to interfere m this business, with any
branch of the Government of the Stateoi New York'
What c irneci'on, what privity, what official rela-
tion is there between th  two Governments, to au
thoriz" th s precipitated decent ol th  on<> uprn

proceeding unauthor zed, unconstitutional and
unbecomms; and if I have not b°en unin-
formed of the sentiments mad" pablic by the
constituted authorities o' New Yoik, t^ey cime
unhesitatingly to the sgme co.iclu ion T-'erea-e,

is portentous, that 1/ ihe indictment wtre pending

ately directed a nolle prosequi to be en ered' Th*1

being furmi-he 1, foi the gra'ifl'atn 1 ot the B-itish
Í ministry, of t^o o! the most d s'ii~mshed GereraK
of 'he United Slates, sent by the Secretary of State
to the vicinity of Canada—one to assuage the en-
thusiasm of the people for the administration of
justic"  upon a notorious interloper and murdering
marauder, the other to take care that he should
have every po siole assistance wh'ch this Federal
Go/ernment could afford to frus'rate the due ad-
ministration ot law in the grea'est State of the
Union. Nor was this all. The Secretary of State,
not using the name of the President at all, instructs
tne Attorney General that it is the wish of this Go-
vernment, lhat in case McLeod's defence be overruled
by the Court in which he shall be iried,proper steps be
taken im<nedia(e!y lor rem ving the canse, by writ
oí error, 10 the Supreme Co.^t of the United Stales.
No thanks to the Secre ary. Sir, it is a mercy,
thereloie, that the Supreme Court ot the United
Smes was not also brought by the Secretary of
State into .he defence of this English pet, when
Mr. Weboter himself mi,ht have rounded the cir-
cie of his unflcdgH dip'omacy, by volunteering his
oiv.i professional services for the vindication of
Mr. McLeod, and the Brjish Legation might all
have attended in Court in this Capilo!, to see that
full ju lice was done. But I beg leave to inquire,
with e'eference to rfasi gentleman's better judgment,
where ne nnds the law, which authorizes the remo-
val of such a case, either after judgment or before,
to a Federal tribunal' And thus taking leave of
the ksser aberrations of the Secretary, I now pro-
ceed to his great, and, as I conceive ¡t, deplorable
capitulation.
Th" British argument addressed lo him was, that
the' tiansactionin question was a jus ifiable employ-
ment of publ'c force, with the sancnoi, or by order
cf th" cons auted outnormes of a S'ate.engaging m-
dividi als   in military or naval enterprises m their
country'  cause, when it would be cornrary to the
upiveisal practice of  civilized nations to fix indi-
vidual responsibility  upon the pernors engaged."
Tms, as 1 dono hesi'ale to pronouocj it, false as-
sumption of la v, ^,at once, conceded by Mr. Web-
ster, in the remarkable  terms,  tint trie ' Govern-
ment   of the Um'eJ  S.aies," by which he must
mean hi..iseif, eatei tains nodoublof tiie  asserted
Bn'i h punciple.    Mr.  Webster had just before
said, that "tht President i* not certain that he un-
derstands precisely the   meaumg intended to fee
conveyed by her Majestj 's Government," "which
doub ,"m add , ' nas occasioned with the Presi-
dent -orne hesitat on "   Thus, wh'le theJJfissident
entertained    a   doubt,   the   Government   enter-
tsiine^ no doubt at  all, whi^h  I cannot  under-
Mand othfiA'*?,  than mat while   tne  President
hes tated    to   concede,    the   Secretary   of State
had no hesitation whatever to concede  at once
tne   t ho"   British    a^'umpl'on, ana   surrender
at d  cRtion the whole   American    case.    For
wher' is the a e of Mr Webs er's posterior,  ela-

s'er t it.t Uui ransacaon was justifiable, and inform-

L_tal blunder Tiecoverab'e, despe'a'e, leaving us
nothi-g but Mr Webster's dreadful alternaave of
cold-hooded, endless, causeless war.
In mother part ot this building, ";he'e I attend-
ed du'm  part of the lammout discussion which
has taken place within the last few days, the ca«e
was l eated as a question of war. But Mr. Fox
makes no such absurd assertion.   He says nothing
