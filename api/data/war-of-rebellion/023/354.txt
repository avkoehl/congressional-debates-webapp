Drove off the workmen at the tunnel. They have a force near Glasgow threatening Green [River] Bridge. I believe all those forces small, though stated in large figures to me. The diversion is in favor of Kirby Smith, who will enter with large force and gain rear of Morgan.

LOUISVILLE, August 16, 1862-12.20 p. m.

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

Sent to General Halleck dispatch of General Morgan. I feel there is more truth in rebel movements than heretofore. I need re-enforcements. I need two batteries of artillery. I have two, one of them just mounted and equipped from garrison at West Point, mouth of Salt River. Governor Tod has not sent a soldier to the State. Can the twelve-months' men furnish their horses, pay for equipments, and get here? I cannot get horses by seizing in time. I have called on Colonel Swords for more horses. Secessionists run horses off and sell for what they can get.
