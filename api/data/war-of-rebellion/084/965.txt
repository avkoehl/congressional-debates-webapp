OMAHA, August 31, 1864.

Brigadier General ROBERT B. MITCHELL,

Fort Kearny, Nebr. Ter.:

Please telegraph me what Nebraska militia have arrived at Fort Kearny from the eastern part of the Territory. I learned yesterday that the Falls City company, which I supposed long ere this had arrived at Kearny, was still at Falls City. I understand, too, that the Nebraska City company numbered only about twenty men. I do not understand that it is the intention to subsist and equip a lot of men to remain on the river towns. The only thing to get this militia matter straight and effective is to have General Curtis or yourself call on the Governor for so many men; have him order them out; have them inspected and accepted for a certain term of days, or else leave he entire matter in the Governor's hands and let him equip, subsist, supply, and move them. In the first case you may get troops; in the latter you probably will not, but we will not be throwing away our supplies to miniature, ephemeral organizations which do us no good.

JNO. PRATT,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Brigadier General ROBERT B. MITCHELL,

Fort Kearny, Nebr. Ter.:

Company D, First Battalion Nebraska Veteran Cavalry, just mustered in. Governor Saunders says he has company of fifty cavalry ready all but horse equipments. Needs thirty-five to complete. Says company cannot move without them. If you want them issued send telegram immediately to Lieutenant Northrop.
