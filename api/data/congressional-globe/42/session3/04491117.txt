leta and lucinda gibbs.
Mr. SPBER also, from the same commit-
tee, reported a bill (EL R. No. 3829) granting
a pension to Leta Gibbs and Lucinda Gibbs;
which was read a first and second time.
The question was upon ordering the bill to
be engrossed and read a third time.

tary of the Interior to place on the pension-
roll, subject to the limitations and provisions
of the pension laws, the names of Leta and
Lucinda Gibbs, the only minor children of
Thomas Gibbs, late a private in company B
seventh Kentucky infantry volunteers.
Mr. SPBER. I desire to say one word in
reference to this bill. Application was made
to the Pension Office in this case, but was re-
jected on the ground that there had been no
marriage between the deceased soldier and his
alleged wife. He had resided-in Kentucky,
and. being a colored man, had married a white
woman. Under the laws of that State such a
marriage was prohibited; but they had lived
together as man and wife, and had always
represented each other as such. He went into
the Army and the mother of his children was
recognized as his wife, and the offspring of
their cohabitation, two daughters, were recog-
nized as his daughters. His enlistment and
service were proved, and the only question
was whether these daughters should be recog-
nized as his children. The committee were
of the opinion that they should be.
The bill was ordered to be engrossed and
read a third time; and being engrossed, it was
accordingly read the third time, and passed.

maria louisa craven.
Mr. SPEER also, from the same committee,
reported a bill (H. R. No. 3830) granting an
increase of pension to Maria Louisa Craven ;
which was read a first and second time.
The question was upon ordering the bill to
be engrossed and read a third time.
The bill was read. It directs the Secretary
of the Interior to increase the pension now
allowed by law to Maria Louisa Craven, widow
of the late Commander T. A. M. Craven, from
thirty to fifty dollars per month from and after
the passage of this act.
Mr. SPEER. I ask that a statement of the
services of Commander T. A. M. Craven be
read.
The Clerk read as follows :
Commander T. A. M. Craven entered the Navy
in the year 1829, and was continually on duty up to
the time he went down in the monitor lecumseh,
under his command—sunk by one of the enemy s
torpedoes in the great naval engagement in .Mobile
bay, under Admiral Farragiit, August 5,lSoi.
In his official report of the action to the Navy De-
partment Admiral Farragut said: At 7.40 (a. m.)
the monitor Tecumseh was struck by a torpedo and
sunk, going down very rapidly, carrying with her
her gallant commander (Craven) and nearly all her
crew The pilot, two officers, and eight or ten men
were saved by a boat which was sent to their assist-
"so important did Admiral Farragut consider the
services of the Tecumseh, that he awaited for her
arrival from New York before he would attempt to
enter Mobile bay. He mentions the arrival ot tae
Tecumseh in the following language: .
"The Tecumseh. Commander Craven, arrived,on
the evening of August 4th, and everything being
propitious, I proceeded to the attack on the follow-
ing morning,, the Tecumseh having been given the
^AgamfAdmiral Farragut says: ".The attacking
fleet moved steadily up the main ship channel, t&e
Tecumseh firing the first shot at forty-seven miautes
past six o'clock a. in." . ,
Iu the letter of Secretary We-lles to Admiral *ar-
ragut, after that terrible conflict, He said: "Great
results in war are seldom attained without great
risks, and it was not expected that the harbor of
Mobile would be secured withootdisaster. The loss
of the gallant Graven and his brave companions,
with the Tecumseh, by a concealed torpedo, was a
casualty .which no human foresight could guard.
While the nation awards cheerful honors to the liv-
ing. she will ever hold in grateful remembrance the
memory of the gallant dead who periled their lives
for their country and died in her cause."
In the month of October, 1861, the board of un-
derwriters of New York presented to Commander
Craven a handsome service of silver plate, in ac-
knowledgment of his efficient services while in com-
mand of the United States ship Crusader, in giving
assistance and protection to American commerce in
the vicinity o( Key West, Florida. A portion of the
inscription upon the plate reads thus: "For render-
ing important services upon several occasions to
American merchant vessels."
During a period of thirty-five years in the Navy,
Commander Craven performed twenty-four years
and six months'service at sea. The foregoing will
give an idea of the character, standing, and services
of the late Commander Craven.
His widow, Maria Louisa Craven, respectfully
asks Congress to increase her pension from thirty
dollars to fifty dollars per month—the said in-
crease to take effect from the dale of her husband's
death. She is poor, and in delicate health, with a
daughter to support in addition to herself, and has
really to struggle to gain a subsistence.
As all Navy pensions are paid out of the Navy
pension fund, a fund created by the Navy itself,
without any taxation upon the people, this amount,
if allowed, would be drawn from that funi} and not
from the general Treasury.
At its last session Congress voted a pension of
$2,000 a year to the widow of the late Admiral Far-
ragut, which was unanimously considered but just
and proper. If, then, the widow of the Admiral
commanding at the action of Mnbile bay is granted
this sum, it would certainly seem but equitable that
the widow of one of his bnve captains, who lost his
life in that terrible conflict while leading the line of
battle, and which conferred so much honor and fame
upon his chief, should, at least, receive a pension of
one third of that amount.
The bill was ordered to be engrossed and
read a third time ; and being engrossed, it was
accordingly read the third time, and passed.
Mr. SPEER moved to reconsider the vote
by which the bill was passed; and also moved
that the motion to reconsider be laid on the
