Brigadier General HUMPHREY MARSHALL

Jeffersonville, Va. (via Wytheville, Va.):

Have you received a copy of the instructions given to General Loring? If so, note reference to yourself. You cannot doubt my goodwill toward you, and I do not doubt your willingness to make any proper sacrifice for our cause.

JEFFERSON DAVIS.

General RUGGLES:

GENERAL: I sent in a courier to inform you of the advance of the enemy in force on our right and left. Our pickets are now firing, about half a mile in advance of the bridge,on right and left. The reserves held in camp have been thrown out on the right and left to guard the guns and give time for them to fall back, if necessary; but from the force reported as advancing (2,000) on the right, I doubt my ability to hold the position with the force under my command, about 400.

Respectfully,

ROBT. H. BARROW,

Commanding Outpost.

GENERAL: I hear from Bolivar that quite a force has passed there toward Memphis. A man of Roddey's company, in from near Iuka, reports quite a force there, and another reports the same movement from Booneville that we heard yesterday. Chalmers is pressing after them with his cavalry.

Yours, truly

BRAXTON BRAGG

Your obedient servant,
