By command of General Beauregard:

JNO. M. OTEY,Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DISTRICT OF GEORGIA,

Savannah, August 5, 1863.

Brigadier General THOMAS JORDAN,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of a letter of the 3rd instant informing me that Brigadier-General Evans, with his brigade, had been ordered to Savannah. I had hoped that Brigadier-General Taliaferro, whose zeal and energy I highly value, might have en returned to me, with his troops, and General Evans ordered to Charleston; but, of course, I acquiesce cheerfully in any arrangements the commanding general may deem proper. As General Evans is my senior in rank, I will turn over the command of this military district to him, relinquishing a responsibility which I never sought an am not unwilling to resign. I trust, however, that this sought in the command will operate no change in the imitation and progress of the important defensive work just set in motion, and which I regard as vital to the safety of this city.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. W. MERCER,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

RICHMOND, August 6, 1863.

General JOSEPH E. JOHNSTON,

Morton, Miss.:

You were telegraphed on the 2nd instant to send Evans' brigade to Savannah, Ga., with the least possible delay.

Has it been sent? Please answer immediately. The enemy are sending large re-enforcements from the north of South Carolina.

S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General.

CHARLESTON, S. C., August 6, 1863-9 a. m.

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General, Richmond, Va.:

All quiet yesterday. No casualties on Morris Island. Our defensive preparations still progressing.
