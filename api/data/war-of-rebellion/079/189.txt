Colonel TOURTELLOTTE,Allatoona:

In riding through your fort to-day, I observed defects which should be corrected at once. The forts on the flanks should be inclosed with good heavy parapets and abatis. More timber should be cut along the Pumpkin Vine, and stockades or stakes at short musket- range, to hold an enemy until he can be dispatched. You should keep half your men at work until this is done. It may save many lives.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

Colonel TOURTELLOTTE:

I would make a good redoubt to the south of the Cartersville road and make a good abatis. Forty men in such a work would be a great protection to that flank. Such a work, with the two at the railroad cut, would be enough to hold Allatoona against a cavalry dash, which is the most that will likely occur again. I attach much importance to abatis.

General COX,

Commanding Army of the Ohio:

GENERAL: My last accounts put the enemy about Cedartown and it is prudent we should be near on him. You may march your army, embracing all detachments and wagons, to and beyond Cartersville, and in case of Kingston being threatened you will hasten to that place, but not beyond without other orders. The other armies will follow, provided we get intelligence that makes it proper and necessary.

Yours,

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

Brigadier General J. D. COX,Commanding Army of the Ohio:

GENERAL: By direction of Major-General Sherman you will move your command at daylight to-morrow morning, marching for Kingston and Rome, and not go into camp until further orders.

I am, general, yours, respectfully,

L. M. DAYTON,

Aide-de-Camp.
