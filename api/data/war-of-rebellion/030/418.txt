arranged in what I consider their order of merit, from which such as the President may be pleased to commission may be selected.

Colonel John H. Morgan is peculiarly suited for the special service in which I propose to employ him-partisan war on the enemy's lines in Kentucky. He has raised his own command, and nearly armed and equipped it from the enemy's stores. Colonel John A. Wharton, recommended for a regular cavalry brigade, which he commanded with signal ability and success in Kentucky, has won his spurs, and I hope will be among the first to receive the recognition due to military merit and moral worth.

I doubt not some improvement could be made in my organizations, which would add greatly to the esprit du corps of the troops, by throwing together into brigades and divisions troops form the same State. This I will endeavor to do when practicable, the present arrangement having resulted from necessity when it was made, admitting of no delay.

I am, general, respectfully, your obedient servant,

BRAXTON BRAGG,
