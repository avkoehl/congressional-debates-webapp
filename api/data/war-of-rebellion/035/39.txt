NASHVILLE, February 3, 1863.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

A scout just in reports that Wharton's and Wheeler's cavalry (6,000 men) and one battery of artillery left Franklin on Saturday evening last at 3 o'clock for Harpeth Shoals, boasting they would take one hundred Federal transports, there being but two gunboats in convoy. Van Dorn is across the Tennessee River with his command, and marching to Shelbyville, so Generals Cheatham and Walthall asserted last Friday evening. Bragg expects no other re-enforcements at present. Joe Johnston was at Tullahoma last Wednesday, but Bragg is in command. He made a speech to his men there that day, and told them he would fight there. Full report to you in the morning. I consider the information reliably reported, and comes from high rebel sources.

Respectfully,

WM. TRUESDAIL,

[Chief of Police.]

MURFREESBOROUGH, February 3, 1863.

Commanding Officer, La Vergne:

Five hundred of Morgan's cavalry reported to be west of road from here to Lebanon, with intention of cutting in on our trains. Look out for him.
