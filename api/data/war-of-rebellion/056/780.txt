of the country, especially as the session of Congress approaches. I think that every effort should be made to concentrate as large a force as possible under the best commander to insure the discomfiture of Grant's army. To do this and gain the great advantage that would accrue from it, the safety of points practically less important than those endangered by his army must be hazarded. Upon the defense of the country threatened by General Grant depends the safety of the points now held by us on the Atlantic, and they are in as great danger from his successful advance as by the attacks to which they are at present directly, subjected.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE,

General.

S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General:

General Leadbetter has just reached here. He left General Longstreet at Knoxville Sunday morning, November 29. General Longstreet had learned that General Bragg had fallen back from Missionary Ridge, and had decided to retreat to Virginia. An assault had been made on one of the enemy's works at Knoxville Sunday morning, the 29th, and had been repulsed. The force at Charleston had retreated to Loudon, and the force at Loudon, under General Vaughn, would probably retreat through the mountains into North Carolina.
