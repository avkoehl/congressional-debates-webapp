WINCHESTER, VA., [June 13, 1863-8 p. m.

Via Martinsburg, Va., June 14-11 a. m. (Received June 14-11 a. m.)

Major-General SCHENCK, Baltimore, Md.:

Have been skirmishing, occasionally pretty severely. One battle, in which the enemy were repulsed, and his lines broken and scattered by two of the Ohio and one Virginia regiment, assisted by the artillery. We captured some prisoners of a Louisiana brigade, who say they belong to Ewell's, recently Jackson's old corps, and that his corps is all in front of us; also Jenkins and Imboden. McReynolds will soon be here . He mad a fight with the rebels, and hard pressed by a heavy body of cavalry . I can hold this place five days, if you can relieve me in that time. They will surround, but can't take, my fortifications.

R. H. MILROY,

Major-General.
