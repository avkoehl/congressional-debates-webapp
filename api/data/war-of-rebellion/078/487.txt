Jones to join Colonel Spalding and feel the enemy. I think Forrest will go over to the Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad by way of Fayetteville; this is but conjecture. Have scouts out to see where he goes. If comes this way will be ready for him. Will move in force upon him when the nip comes. Advise me of matters.

LOVELL H. ROUSSEAU,

Major-General.

NASHVILLE, TENN., September 26, 1864-11 p. m.

Major-General MILROY,

Tullahoma:

The operator at Decherd telegraphs here that scouts report the enemy coming that way from the direction of Fayetteville. Better hurry up the forces which are said to have been stopped at Stevenson and Bridgeport. Please report at once the appearance of the enemy on your road, if they come.

Major B. H. POLK,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Major Wortham, commanding at Wartrace, reports that seven rebels crossed the railroad between Bell Buckle and Fosterville, going east, and he learned they were messengers to Williams, and that Williams and Forrest were to form a junction on this road. Wortham has a scouting party after them.

COLUMBIA, September 26, 1864.

Major POLK,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

A scout out for three days south of this post has just returned; reports that Forrest crossed at Florence, and lost 30 men drowned; that his destination is Bridgeport, and from there to East Tennessee. Biffle was at Lawrenceburg, with 700 men and two pieces of artillery. No news from Rousseau.

W. B. SIPES,

Colonel, Commanding Post.

JOHNSONVILLE, September 26, 1864-9 p. m.

Major B. H. POLK,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

One gun-boat is here. Another is expected hourly. They will be of much service in case of an attack. If there is much danger of an attack I can draw in some of the forces on this end of the road guarding water-thanks and small trestles.

CHAS. R. THOMPSON,

Colonel, &amp;c.
