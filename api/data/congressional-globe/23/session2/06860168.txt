THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
January 26.
actually happened'   Such losses, it is known, fall
upon the people
The Olei k of tms House disburses a contingent
fund of S"veial ti ousand do! ars a year, and has
charge oí much of the people's property, and has
a large patronage in the appointment ot officers
la it to be ¡supposed that the people neither know
or u re wno holds ti is office > Our door keeper
has the appointment of almost as many officers as
some small States The Speaker, also, appoints
many persons about the PIou*-e,and has_ charge of
the luimtureot the Hall In the faithful disburse-
ment of money, in the preseivation of property,
and in the faithful discha ge of the duties of all
the officers of the House, the people have a deep
l uerest, and we have but little If the people
werea« ignoiant and careless about who and what
the officeisot the House were, he would ask now
it happened that the acts of a late Speaker of this
Blouse, in the appointment of committees, were
made a pi omiueiit ground for his lejeciion as mm
istei to England > It is a lit Je extraordinary if that
grave body had fastened upon the ac 8 of an ofh
cer of this House to ju tify his lejection, when in
a whole State not" ten men" knew whotne officer
was, and when they did not know or caieany
thing about his election This was presuming
largely upon the ignoiance and carelessness of ihe
people lie (Mr & ) must abide by ihe conclusion
'hat the people did know and care about these
things
Mr G knew nothing of the facts upon which
rumoi hud predicated her news but cei tain it was
that her tales had led the people to inquire much
after our ballot-box transactions here Whether
there was anything wrong or worthy of censure,
was not for htm to say He had, however, been
asked to know why,on a íecentelection foi Cleik
of this House, there had been more ballots than
legal qualified voUrs, and why a lecent candidate
ror punter of this House had not been declaied
elected, when he had been aole to piove he had
had a majouty of all the votes' Inquiries about
ihe election ot othet cfíícfcis had been made, and
he had been unable to answer because he did not
know, and this had been ins ieply The esponse
was, " Vote openly and let us know how these
things are done and by whom " Such were the
sentiments of all who had spoken to him on this
subject, and he doubted no' that such wou d be
found to be tne views of nil in relation to the
doings of then agents here
Mr G thought ¡his the true ground that, when
we vote as citizens, in the exeioise offiee, full,
and untrammelled soveieign powei, when we
weie accountable only to ourselves and our Maker
foi our acts when no one had a right to question
ourmotivesoi call us to an account foi 0111 doings,
we should vote by ballot, and when we vo'td in
oui lepresentative capacity,^ should vote ma
voce, 01 by yeasardnays lntheoluvaliousWest,
fiom the glowing ai courts of their independence,
and exemption fiotu íelianceupon others for sup
pott, it would seem that the ballot box was of
¡ess moment than in othei parts of the world
But there might be places, such as laige cities and
manufacturing towns, where things were diftei
tntly situated Ihere might be men who had
< thers, even hundreds of them in their employ,
and entirely dependent upon them for the means
of supporting their families, and it might so happen
that these men would beiei/uneiito vote in a pa, tic
ular mannei 01 be ti rown out of employment lie
would ask, did not ihe^e things ac ually occur in
the tlisliessed year 18J4'
Then let the people continue the use of the
ballot boxes in the exercise of the soveieign power
of appointing their agents On the othei hand,
let us as agents act openly, manfully, and in such
a mannei as to enable our princ pals to judge of
our action"!, and to protect ourselves fiom the
suspicion oi having do e what they would not
approve Istheieaman here who desues to con-
ceal his vote, or avoid the strictest scrutiny ' lie
hoped not In tne South and West nearly all
vote viva vece Those who were appointed agents
by a v\va voce vote ceitamlv would not claim tobe
moie independent than their consutuei ts, and
desi e to conceal their,vote He would further
remark, if ¡lure were those heie or elsewheie,
who had a horror ot secret societies, and secret
influences, and who claimed much at the hands of
he people from then desire tiiat everything should
be suommed to the scrutiny of open day, he cei
tauily should   expect their  hearty support ai d
appioval of this lesolution
He doubted not lhat the people would be well
pleased, to I ouow the figure of my friend from
Kentucky, [Mr Hardin,J if all the acts of their
agents here were wiitten in sunshine in the fuma
ment of heaven, that tney might read, and ap
prove, or dist.ppiove them But it is said this
resolution will not bind the next Congress, and
will have no effect upon the present If so, it
can do no harm It is befoie us, and we must
vote foi or against it, whether it avails us much
or little, and whetner it embiaees officers we hav 
to elect this session or not Perhaps it would,
like many íesolutions, result in lit le but the as
semon ot principles He eaied not what migln
be hereiftei construed to be within its provisions,
or the extent it might be considered buidi g He
should vote for the resolution, because he believed
it light in principle, and ought to receive the sane
tion of this House, j id be the ui e of action in
"choosing" all the officers of tne House, as it has
been for twenty yeais, in choosing thiee fouiihs
of them The principle eon'ended for was not
only light in itself, but was sustained by a stiong
I int' cation of the intention of the mikers of the
J Constitution, and has the sanction of the people

Mr   CLAYTON said, the  ) reposition before
the House slro igl) lemmded him of a celerjrated
Spanish   epnaph,  wl eh,   when he   lt-peated it,
wou d su ^iciently exulain  itself     The words en
graven on the tomb stone weie   " I was well   I
wished to be bettei, I took  physic, aid heie 1
he "    Now, the Flouse had practiced its piesei t
J mode ot election for the last forty years, without
I finding occasion for alteia'iois oi new devices
I I he gen leman'ast up but one had given some
I spec mei s of piophecy     Had  he confined him-
l| selt to his ptopheues, lather than his pledges, it
would peinaps have been more agreeable      He
proposed   to    nuke a piophecy himseif, and he
would particularly invoke towaids it theattention
and itculleclion of the House     It was, that as
I soon as the otject of tint resolution was accom
p plished, it woukl beicpealed    It was fashionable,
to< "occasionally to  deal a little m poetry     He
lemem Leted a couplet not en irely inapplicable to

Much  debate had   been elicited  to   determine
whetht i tint, íes iltitie n was desigred to apply to
the pu itei of the House    Mr C said he had con
suited  no witnesses when  he declared that such
was the lact     What otner offieei could it apply
t), when no othei was" to be elected '   Why else
was this íesolu ion deemed so peculiarly impon
! ant at this late stage of the last session'    If they
j had passtd  he resulut'on at the commencemer t
of the preceding session, there would   be moie
plausibility in its aspect     But its passage at the
pr bet t time would   be viewed a3 an attempt to
1 intei eie and   tamper with the rights and privi
le«es of the next Congi ess     One of the fíiot acts
of that C ingress would doubtless be to repeal the
die atonal lesolution      Mi   C   called the at'ention
j of the House to the primary organization of legis
j lative   bodies     Ihe fiist step   was doubtless to
appoint a I ead, and afterwards ti elect the subor
dinateoffueis and assistants     If one was elected
vivu voce, the otherb would come undei  tire same
lule     It  was more .i matter of ton lenience to
themselves than one a Meeting the liberties of the
people     But if the rule applied to the higher offi
^ers, it did equally so to the minore nes, for wnen
you stop with these, and denominate the less offi
ces as unimportant matteis, you make the vtva
v ce  system  depend on the  miioitanr-e  of the
office, and not on the general principie contended
for
Mr   C  said fiequent allusions had been made
I to the mteiest which the peop e felt in this ques
| tion     Now, he wruld venture to make an as*er-
! tion, m the tiuih of which he would call on that
i House to bear him out, that in eigl teen States out
I of the twenty-four, the elections were conducted
1 by ballot     bo that if we go to the people—the
great source of all power—for a rule of action
their voice would be found m favor of the bnliot'
mg system I o himself, personally, it was quite
unimportant The vote ma lot c would be as
acceptable as any other He cared not if mem-
bers etiope to appioach the desk with their votes
p sted on thfir foieheads Beit he could not jus
tify the peiveision of prmcii le3 which had stocd
the test of forty years on hgh' and trivial grourd
The gentleman from New York had offeied a
quo'ation from the scnptuies This, perhaps,
would be improper on tuning occasions, but if it
was designed to enforce a serious argument, he
could have no oojection to it The people, he
conceived, weie the legitimate masters of their
representatives The effect of the resolution would
be to cieate for them new masters, who " loved
d?rkness lather than light " " We cannot seive
two masters," and whne the " treasure is, there
will be the heart also "
It was well known that withm a short period
some forty oi fifty members of Congress had " re-
ceived the rewaid of their labors, and weie row
at rest " Another argument had been advanced
in favor of the resolution, that it would be a saving
of time This he deemed of little consequet ce
The more time the House spent in doing nothing,
tne bettei foi their constituents Again, it 13
uiged in support of the resolution by the g°nt'e-
man from New York, [Mr Vanderpocl,] in its
1 application to the other officers of the House,
that you, sir, have no* a lease of your life—tht t
I you aie not irr moitai' He hoped the gentleman
I woul 1 not admit that the suppoit of then measuie
■ would involve the k lling of the Speaker The
proper w ly to test the strength of an aigument
I was to take away all otheis.and see how it would
stand on that alone Do so in the piasent case,
ai d how many members would vote for ttieprop-
osition on that contingency' It had also been
gravely alleged thatan rfficei of the House, elected
by bal ot, foi sooth, had foi merly decamped with
a poi tion of its funds ' Could it be seriously con-
tended that an election uiti voce wouM remedy or
pievent such an evil' He could not spproce of
that species of logic which leads us to jump to
conclusions fiom false or inapplicable premises
Mi C said he had probably occupied theatten-
tion of the House already too long in subrenting
what he had to say Believing this resolution
designed to alter a practice of fort/ years star d ng
for tne purpose of effecting a single olject, and
calculated to leave them fotindeiug on the un-
ki own coast of experiment, or subject to an im-
mediate lepeal on theaccomphshme tof its special
purpose, he should give n s vote against it
Mr  SEABORN JONES said it seemed to him
I that if the lesolution under consideration were to
' be adopted by the present Corgress, no actnn
j would ensue upon  it hereafter, because, as each
House had, under the Constitution, the power " to
choose then Speaker and othei officers," the next
House would not be bound by it     Fur'heimoie,
not only was the election, but also the mode of
choosn g, left entnely with each, and therefore, if
the reso'ution was designed to embrace the officers
of the House, it did  not be'ong  to the existing
body to pass it, since the mode of electing no more
be'onged to it, than did the election   itself, of the
officeis of the next Congress     We have been told
I by an honorable colleague, [Mr  Giivfr] (said
1 Mr J ,)and by othergentlernen.that theiesolution
j was offei ed for a cei tain specified object, and that
was, to bear upon the election of punter    If this
were so, and if the printer were an officer of the
House, then have we (said Mr  J ) no right to
elect him, for, it we did, it would be taking the
power fiom the next Congress to do so, contrary
to the above pfovisio 1 of the Constitution    Sup-
posing the resolution should pass,m the phraseol-
ogy in which it is diawn, to wit, that all elections
ot i fficers of the House shall be by i>tt>a voce vote
of the members, what would be the result' Would
I ihe rule be operative in the election of Speaker of
•-the next Congress'   He trusted not.   What was
the regular mode of proceeding at the firstAssem-
b'y'    The Clerk of the House took the chair,
j and was the piesiding officer for the time being,
and the House pi oceeded to elect their Speakei by
j ballot, or in any otner way the then assemblage
of members thought pioper      Well, suppose,
