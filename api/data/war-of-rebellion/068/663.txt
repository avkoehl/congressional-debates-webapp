General WARREN,

Commanding Fifth Corps:

Barlett is retained here until it is ascertained where he is most needed.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief and Staff.

MAY 12 - 9.10 a. m.

General HUMPHREYS:

My left cannot advance without a most destructive enfilade fire until the Sixth Corps has cleared its front. My right is close up to the enemy's works, and ordered to assault. The enemy's line here appears to be strongly held. It is his point-d'appui if he throws back his right.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,May 12, 1864 - 9.15 a. m.

Major-General WARREN,

Commanding Fifth Corps:

The order of the major-general commanding is peremptory that you attack at all hazards with your whole force, if necessary.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief and Staff.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,May 12, 1864 - 9.30 a. m.

DEAR WARREN:

Don't hesitate to attack with the bayonet. Meade has assumed the responsibility and will the consequences.

Your friend,

A. A. HUMPHREYS.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,May 12, 1864 - 9.30 a. m.

General WARREN:

Barlett is sent to Griffin. Kitching will be retained for Wright.

Hancock and Wright both report that they are hard pressed. The commanding general concludes that the enemy cannot be very strong in your front.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
