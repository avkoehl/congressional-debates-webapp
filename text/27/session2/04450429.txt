the fact w"as put down in writing at the time, and though it was
not published in the papers, it waa sent to Mr Van Buren for
hla inspection, and after looking at it he became sati&fied that
It was true Perhaps this is not a mater.al fact, I use it as an
answer to the gentleman from \ irginia, to show that I did not
originally negotiate the treaiy with the present boundary of he
Sabine. I maintained ray demand lor the Rio del None till
Ml Monroe and his cabinet oveiruled me and assented to the
Sabine But at that time Texas was a wPdemess, with no pop-
ulation, oi at least no American population 1 eo not behave
there were 5,000 people in the «hote teintory, and they wcie
Spanish subjects In the couise of negotiation, and after the
terms of the treaty had been concluded, the nist American pro
ject for the settlement of the countiy was brought into being
I received a very long letter from Mxces Austin, (I think his
name waa Moses, father of Stephen Austin,) stating that his
object was to make a settlement m the wilderness He was a
sort of a Boon, and he proposed to collet t in ihe midst of New
England as laigea colony as he could, and with them to eo into
Texas and teule ti e country That was the stave of things
under which I was in favor i f annexation
When my pi op wition was mad* to the Mexican Government
m 1825, slaveiy I ad been abolish  d m that ten itory There
was not a slave there, nor was there the ieist reason toexpect
there ever would be 'Iheie existed therefore no leason why I
should be avei^e to the annexation of tins new region to the
territory oí the Union Had it been annexed, it would iiave
been settled by freemen I should certainly have had roob
jectionto that, not do I know that I should object now, if it
was brought within the scope of possibility I should noun
deed desne it, because I think we have quite enough territory
already. We have certainly as much as we can manage But
even as territory, it is nqt desnable I ¡diouid not wish it to
form a part of the Union, even if it weie setfled with fieemen,
and were a free State, as I would have wished it in 1825 cr
1827 Slaveiy was then abolished, and if Texas hid come into
the Union, theie would have been no powerm the United States
to restore it Does the gentleman from Virginia think be
cause, under such circumstances, I wished to see theannexa
tion at that time, that this is an argument either to show the ex
pedieñcy of its annexation now, or any moons steney m me be
cause I am now utterly oppo=ed to ni

lilt were ten tuuu&an i turns more vat us ole han it is, sullied as
it is with the dime of siaveiy re muí Tlie people of Texas
have not the apology which, with w ia ev rf>rre impleaded by
many of those in our Southern States—that the slavery which
now mfests th^m was a vice, a enmp, a misfortune, adisease
inflicted upon them by the parent State, and that that i=> tbe lea
son why they must suppoit it now I must say, that in riy
heart, if not in my mind, that is the strongest argu-rtfisnt they
ever have ad luced in support of it but Texas has no ¡tuch do
fence to set up, slavery was no*, beque tthed to them irom a self
ish and cruel btepmOiher, asalmostali thelibeia! menofVirgi
ma used to say of it in their cominuuwealth not m my yeajs
ago, and as some among them «till say If iheie can be an apo
logy for this plague spot, I say again that the people of Texts
have none to plead, and that is the itison*why JUxasnever
shall, with my consent, o", as 1 hope, with the content of my
constituents, or of any portion of the fi ee people of the United
States, become an integial paitof this,Union
Theie is another reason—a re won I «dmu vastly inferior to
the othei, but «till it is a iPV>on Testis has acceded to the
right ot search she is bourd by tieaty to that effect If you
take her as a pait of omselves, vou take her with her treaties
