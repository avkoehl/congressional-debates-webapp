Washington, December 21, 1865.

Honorable HENRY T. BLOW, M. C.,

Washington, D. C.:

SIR: Referring to your interview of this date with Acting Assistant Secretary of War, and in connection with letters to you from His Excellency the Governor and Adjutant-General of Missouri, relative to the muster out of the remaining organizations of Missouri Volunteers, I have the honor to inform you that the exigencies of the service have demanded the retention of the said troops in service for a longer period than was anticipated. In October last it was expected that all would have been mustered out by the 1st instant. No means have been spared to hasten the discharges as rapidly as the services of the troops could be dispensed with, and those yet in service will be discharged at the earliest date practicable. The public interest, however, will not permit an order for the discharge of all at the same time.
