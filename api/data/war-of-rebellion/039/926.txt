The next day the division fortified its position on the left of the Plank road, fronting the United States Ford. General Pender, in command of the division, being wounded in the evening, the command of the division devolved on me, and that of the brigade on Colonel [B. D.] Fry for a short time, during which nothing important occurred except some skirmishing in front.

My loss in this action was 41 killed and 317 wounded. Among the former was Major [J. T.] Smith, Thirteenth Alabama Regiment, and Captain [S. D.] Stewart, commanding Fifth Alabama Battalion, and among the latter Colonel [William] McComb, Fourteenth Tennessee Regiment, severely.

My assistant adjutant-general (Captain [Robert Harris] Archer) and aide-de-camp (Lieutenant [Oliver H.] Thomas) were present with the brigade throughout the action.

I take this occasion to acknowledge the gallant and efficient service of Mr. G. A. Williams, of Maryland, a volunteer aide on my staff.

The regiments were commanded as follows: First Tennessee [Provisional Army], Lieutenant Colonel [N. J.] George; Thirteenth Alabama, Colonel Fry; Fourteenth Tennessee, Colonel McComb, until wounded, and afterward by Captain [R. C.] Wilson; Seventh Tennessee, by Lieutenant-Colonel [John A.] Fite, and Fifth Alabama Battalion by Captain Stewart.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. J. ARCHER,

Brigadier-General.

Captain R. H. FINNEY, Assistant Adjutant-General.
