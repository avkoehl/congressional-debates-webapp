FORT LEAVENWORTH, July 29, 1865.

Brigadier General P. E CONNOR,

Fort Laramie:

Major Mackey, of Fort Laramie, estimates for subsistence stores for Fort Laramie for 3,000 soldiers, 250 citizens, 400 Indians, 100 officers, &amp;c., nearly doubling the estimates heretofore sent and reported to you my letter of June 13. Estimates therein stated called for stores for 2,000 men for Laramie and 900 for Powder River for one year. This appears to me sufficient. My letter of June 13 shows that estimates have been received for 17,000 men; 1,500 have been added to that for Utah. Is this not stores enough, and more than we shall need for the ensuing year? If some posts as short, theirs must have a surplus, which can be transferred as they are needed. This winter our force will necessarily be reduced, and we do not want to pile up stores that cannot be used. The estimate up to June 13 and from Salt Lake makes 18,000,000 pounds for subsistence stores alone. This is as much as we can get transportation for, and is 8,000,000 more than is contracted for, and in addition thereto are quartermaster's and ordnance stores that are en route.

G. M. DODGE,

Major-General.
