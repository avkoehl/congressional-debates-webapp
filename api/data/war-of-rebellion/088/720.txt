HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,September 6, 1864-2 a. m. (Sent 6 a. m.)

Major-General HANCOCK, Commanding Second Corps:

I meant to say in my dispatch of 10.15 p. m. [5th], that probably it would be best after furnishing the party for the abatis to divide the remainder available for fatigue duty between the work about the Williams house and the work beyond it, filling less than half the engineer requisition for party.

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,September 6, 1864-9 a. m.

General WILLIAMS, Assistant Adjutant-General:

My whole command has been on fatigue during the night excepting Mott's division. The line from the Williams house to the left is pretty well under way and is still being worked on.

HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,September 6, 1864.

General HUMPHREYS, Chief of Staff:

Two deserters from Wilcox's old brigade have just come in. They report nothing new. Neither of them has seen or heard of Early's command, but understand that Longstreet's troops, which were on the other side of the James, have been brought here. They are both ignorant men. No unusual activity was noticed by them in their own division.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,September 6, 1864-12.20 p. m.

Deserters from Hoke's division corroborate the information sent by you last night and this morning respecting the movement of troops to our left yesterday and at night. They state that Early's troops and others moved to our left yesterday and last night.
