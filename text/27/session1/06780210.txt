27th Cong. •• lvr Sess.                               Duties and Drawbacks—Mr. Ingersoll.                                                       H. of Reps.
well There was no resistance to it, and little
complaint, even in the most disaffected parti of
the country It yielded largely. It cost but little
mors than five per cent, for collection; whereas
now, upon an income docreasing under the com-
promise aet in geometical ratio, the cost of collat-
ing it increases in that ratio; amounting, according
to the answer I got from the chairman of the Com-
mittee of Ways and Means, to at lea t twelve per
cent; near two millions of dollars, says the gentle-
man from Massachusetts [Mr. Saltonstall]—
one mill on seven hundred thousand dollars." To
manage the customs, Government is obliged to
employ not less than two thousand officers, heavly
paid, and •■aid to be the most active partisans; those
who, in this metropolis, are extremely annoj nig
by their importunate contests for office, and ehe
wh re still more offensive by misconduct, some-
times of a gross kind, as in the in tance of one,
whom I need not name, in my distr ct The ve-
nerable gentleman from Vermont, [Mr Everftt]
siiggrsicd yesterday a tax on auctions as useful to
American manufactures On that, I give no op'-
mon But this I say, that a stamp tax on bank
notes, and a duty on auctions, would not require
fi'ty men to collect them. It is not for us of th 
minority to determine whether they should be '¿id
Yet I make bold to suggest to the friends or the
great lead'1, who, next to the Pres, dent, hv the
poverof legislation at present, that onecf ihre 
alternatives is inevitable.
They must either borrow more than tVe twelve
millions now authorized, or resort to interna' du-
nes, or break the compromise acf, letter and Ti-
nt Of the twelve millions to be raised by loan,
it is said that ntne millions are already p'edged,
so that only a margin of three millions re natns
disposable currently. I do not undeistand tba'
means are wanting immediately, but eventually
and soon all the Administration members insist
they will be, a  I ihe re^pon lb'e chairman ot
Ways and Moans ;soes so fai as to reckon bit
about ten million-, ss regular simphes This te >i-
poiar} tarifi is therefore but a short lived expedi-
ent, only a shi't for theprearnt. Taxrs musí V

Will this Administration shrink from internal d i-
tips, it necessary? Do they Halter themselves that
i Innk may be substi'utpd tor .hei ? That wis
tned in Pen'isylvan a for satisfactory taxes re-
pealed, and the result is too well l-nown—i mi <-
rable failure. Loans and borrowing wer f d
thnre, too, with no better success The one thin, 
needful, taxation, h¡t'« be -eme t > at last, a« it

a pnncijdi" of eonorov, as applicable to S'a <■
as individuals, that property arqu red wi t. n>

checked and chastised, jf not removed, if evp-y
member, instead of voting for delusive imposts,
were io record bis  name to burdens whicn all his
constituents could directly  perceive  and ppprp-
ciate.
I listened with edification to the account of the
venerable member from Massachusetts, [Mr
Adams ] of the method of enacting the compro-
mise aet—what may be called the perpetration
of that memorable measure. Certair ly it put an end
to fearful strife. Perhaps it saved this glorious I
Union. I wish to be understood as speaking re-
spectfully of both the distinguished persons who
aresaidtohaveaceompl.shedit. After all, however, '
it was rather tiseir individual achievement than an
actofCongresr. The two chiefs, the towering peaks,
of overhanging prohibiten y protection and forcible
nullification, nodlel ther sum mi's together, and
the v ork wa> done, without the active agency of
either the executive or legislative branches of Go
vernment Its influences on public tranquil'i'y
were benignant But how to be regarded as eco-
nomical or censinuticnal le sot s, is adiffeient ques
tion, which, at this session, I am hardly prepared
to unravl. Un'VcnmtnaUng impost, twmty per
cent flush throughout, on all ar ides alike, will
not answer 'he purposes of the Union or of my
S'ate It is noi supposed by their advocates that
it will The present bill 13 to be transient, we |
are to have more oarticular, more thorough and
permanent la'vs hereafter Without giving in mv
adhesion to the compromise act, or announcing
opposition to it, I hope to see such government
as will etisure steady employment, at good wages,
by which I mean high wages, paid in faürd money;
no others can be good, high, or adequate, or mo-
ney at all; for every branch of industry, agricil-
tural, commercial, manufacturing, and navigation,
that palmy slate ot a country, tr  which this of
all otbeis is cnti ei,pulchemmo popuhfctstigio.
Has'y contrivances like this bill, to rai e the
wages and mea"s are substantial homage to the
past Administration, whose superior ability as well
as economy, they acknowledge b> stiong implica-
tion. With not only a currency toMlly disordered,
but, as is s outly entended by all fV finaicu rs of
tiie present majority, -uc1) la"k of income, that it
was obliged to subsi t on ex r rrcly limited re cans,
that Admim>tration neverthless reduced the annml

national prosperity ere psienmal, and fljw like
rivers, ever on, liable, indeed, to U-ie-, to flux and
reflux, yet always in steady current.   You cannot
dam them up for a season without endangering, if
not destroying, them altogether You cannot even
divert Ihe stream, without perilous effects m the
channel and the source. A settled order of
things is never to be disturbed with im-
punity. Contrivances for temporary relief, if
they dislocate the settlements of property, cost
more than they come to. They have been well
called the preposterous politics of short sighted po-
liticians They are like what Montesquieu says
of the savages, who, in order to get at the fruit on
a tree, cut it down. Tea, coffee, sugar, salt, and
molasses, taxed as luxuries, no to mention silks
and wines, m the sam  budget wmch declares epau-
le's, poisons, stationery, gems, paintings, and en-
gravings, ) eces-sane-. not to be taxed, and rail road
iron, another necessary for S'ates and corpora-
tions—all this farrago of crudities makes one
think t f the sentiment that there is nothing so ab-
surd but it has been proposed by some philos' pher
or another. Instead of such precipit?te and peri-
lous proceeding, I wish to see these matters de-
liberately considered, next session, dulr discrimi-
nated, and properly airanged, by judicious com-
promise Hast/ and pernicious legislation, Hnder
the one hour rule and perpetual previous ques-
tions, may beget a bastard act of Congress; but
what will it be? The sponsor in th -> Hoo-e, Mr
Fillmore, riddled by the cannonade frrm all his
party associates, Mr. Irwin, Mr Winthrof, Mr
Barnard, and Rir. Salst jnstall, unJer the bless-
ed operation of the one hour rule, may not have a
chance to explain why tea and coffee have be-
come luxuries, and so many of the costly decora-
tions of dress and furniture, necessaries of life: an
explanalior, which, he. mav depend oi it, the com
munity v ill insist upor. If, sir, I were a malig-
nant eneny of fhi" Administrauon, I could ask
nothing better for my party than the hurried pas-
sage of this preposterous bill, aga nst which all
speak who speak at all It is not, however, these
objectionable details of the bill which I chiefly de-
sire to dwell upon, but a 'Liten more mportant
offspring of it Some um° 'ino , th  cry went
forth from a distinguí hed Sena or, now a mem-
ber ot the Executive, that French silks and
