Honorable E. M. STANTON, Secretary of War:

SIR: I have the honor to renew my recommendation of Lieutenant Colonel William E. Strong, assistant inspector-general of this arm, for promotion. for dinstinguished gallantry during the Atlanta campaign I recommend that he be brevetted colonel; for remarkable efficiency as my chief of staff during the Savannah campaign, that he be brevetted brigadier-general; and for specially gallant and efficient service during the Carolina campaign that he be appointed brigadier-gneeral, to take rank from March 21, the date of the engagement near Bentonville, N. C. If, for want of a vacancy or other reason, it is deemed inconsistent with the interests of the public service to appoint Lieutenant-Colonel Strong to brigadier-general of volunteers, I would most strenuously urge that he receive the brevet rank of brigadier-general as a deserved recognition of his distinguished services.

Very respectfully,

O. O. HOWARD,

Major-General.

Brigadier General A. B. EATON,

Chief Commissary, U. S. Army:

GENERAL: I have the honor to recommend for promotion to the rank of colonel, in accordance with the recent act of Congress, Lieutenant Colonel David Remick, the chief commissary of subsistence of this army during the Savannah and Caroina campaigns. Lieutenant-Colonel Remick was my commissary while in command of the Fourth Corps, and has always given perfect satisfaction. His services during the last campaign from Savannah to this point are especially deserving of commendation. It was in a large measure owing to the energy and practical ability of this officer that we were able to subsist this army upward of fifty days, although starting with only fifteen days' rations. It gives me pleasure to commend to yu one who, by so long and arduous services, proved himself an able and faithful officer.

I am, general, respectfully,

O. O. HOWARD,

Major-General.
