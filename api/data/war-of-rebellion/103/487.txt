Press and type of following-named newspapers: Columbus Sun, Columbus Enquirer, Columbus Times, and the type, one press, &c. of Memphis Appeal.

At the depot were 2 rifled siege guns and 1 smooth-bore siege gun, not mounted: also 11 old iron guns (field pieces), and 2 mountain howitzers, mounted. Near headquarters post were 4 brass 6-pounders and limbers, smooth-bore, and at a foundry northeast part of town were 16 field pieces, caissons, &c., caliber not known. At the arsenal was 1 Napoleon gun, new, quite a number of limbers and caissons. Total number of guns, exclusive of the 6 splendid 7-inch rifled ones on gun-boat Jackson, 68. Nearly all were thrown into the river.

Quartermaster's property found in store and issued to the troops and negroes or destroyed: 4,500 suits of Confederate uniform, 5,890 yards army jeans, 1,000 yards osnaburgs, 8,820 pairs of shoes, 4,750 pairs of cotton drawers, 1,700 gray jackets, 4,700 pairs of pants, 2,000 pairs of socks, 4,000 tin cups, 2,000 tin plates, 960 wooden buckets, 20 telegraphic instruments, 400 shirts, 375 hatchets, 650 gray caps, 33 tin pans, 6 coils 1/2-inch rope, 15 boxes carpenter's tools, 400 wall-tents and flies, 1,000 axes and halves, 1,000 picks and halves, 400 spades and shovels.

Destroyed at Girard (opposite Columbus): One rope factory, 2 Government blacksmith shops, 2 locomotives, 15 box-cars, and an extensive round-house and railroad machine-shop. The machine-shops, foundries, factories, and other works destroyed here, as above enumerated, were of immense value to the rebels and to the entire South. More than 5,000 employes are thrown upon the community for other support. No private buildings are thrown upon the community for other support. No private buildings in Columbus were destroyed, and no buildings fired except by order and with proper authority. There are thousands of almost pauper citizens and negroes, whose rapacity under the circumstances of our occupation, and in consequence of such extensive destruction of property, was seemingly insatiable. The citizens and negroes formed one vast mob, which seized upon and carried off almost everything movable, whether unself or not. Four bridges over the Chattahoochee River, at and near Columbus, were thoroughly destroyed, one (old) by the enemy and three (including the railroad bridge) by our troops.

Respectfully submitted.

Brevet Brigadier-General, Commanding Post.
