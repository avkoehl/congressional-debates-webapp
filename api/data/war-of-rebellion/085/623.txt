you are ordered north bring all the militia with you except those necessary for the defense of Fort Scott and Humboldt. See that they have plenty of ammunition, and take measures to feed them en route. The wagons you may need for this movement should be put in order at once. Guerrillas are reported active in the vicinity of Independence and along the border. I hope everything at Fort Scott is in a condition to withstand any attack from cavalry or bushwackers, no matter in what force.

I am, sir, respectfully, your obedient servant,

HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF SOUTH KANSAS,Lawrence, October 4, 1864.

Colonel T. MOONLIGHT,

Commanding Sub-District Numbers 2, Paola, Kans.:

SIR: The Governor has been advised of the difficulty with the militia, and I hope that ere this orders have been sent them which will be final. I was under the impression that they had been in service ever since the Governor wrote me he would turn them out, about the 21st September, and did not know the contrary until your recent telegram. Lieutenant Harper was directed to ration them, and wagons, &amp;c., were asked to be sent from the department for their use. I regret that I was not set right in this matter before. If they ever get under arms send them to Olathe and have them drilled and put in the best shape possible. Provisions and ammunition will be sent there, for which the proper U. S. officers will receipt, and they will make the issues to the militia. I do not wish provisions in bulk to be turned over to the militia officers. Your own commissary must issue on proper provision returns for not less or more than five days at a time. As Olathe may be the most important point in your sub-district for the next fortnight, I desire you to change your headquarters there for the present. We have no additional news from Price. The movements of General Rosecrans may force him upon us, though I hardly think he will put his main army so far west of his route back to Arkansas. We must be on the alert for considerable bodies of mounted men, with whom he will undoubtedly cover his right flank, and use them also for forage and pillage. This is the most I think we will have to contend against. I can add nothing to the instructions already given you in reference to keeping your troops in hand and ready to concentrate upon the threatened point. Your wagons should be put in order, and everything so regulated that no delays in your movements or that of your supplies take place. If the rebels cross the line north of Harrisonville, Mo., I design Olathe as the point of concentration, and as the news of their crossing will r each you before it does me you will be governed accordingly. You must provide for the possible interruption of the telegraph and have reliable messengers ready to convey information to these headquarters. If there is but one regiment of militia in Miami County, about 300 of them can be left at Paola for its defense. This will enable you to use your own troops in the field. The two companies of the Eleventh, at Fort Scott, were ordered to report to you before your request was received. You can send for the 24-pounder at Topeka, provided you can man it, horse it, and have ammunition for it.

I am, sir, respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. SYKES,

Major-General, Commanding.
