Vicksburg, May 3, 1863.

Commanding Officer or Operator, Edwards Depot:

Stop all troops en route here at Edwards Depot, by my order, till further orders. What troops are there? Has the passenger train passed this way? Is any of our cavalry at Edwards?

J. C. PEMBERTON.

Vicksburg, May 3, 1863.

General FEATHERSTON, Edwards Depot:

Place two pieces of artillery at head of bridge, and in the morning continue the intrenchments, with all the force you can get. General Loring, with rest of his command, will probably reach bridge to-night, on this side.

J. C. PEMBERTON.

Vicksburg, May 3, 1863.

Major General W. W. LORING, Rocky Springs:

You will take position on river at railroad bridge, striking the river at that point or such other as may be most convenient.

J. C. PEMBERTON.

SCHOOL-HOUSE CROSS-ROADS, near Big Black, May 3, 1863-10. 30 a. m.

Lieutenant General J. C. PEMBERTON,

Commanding Department:

GENERAL: The command is now rapidly passing the Big Black. Shall the army move with dispatch to Vicksburg, or shall it hold the Big Black? I would like to know your wishes with reference to the future movement of the army. It is reported the enemy extending their lines in the direction of Rocky Springs.

I am, general, very respectfully,

W. W. LORING.

BIG BLACK, May 3, 1863-3 p. m.

Lieutenant General J. C. PEMBERTON,

Commanding Department:

GENERAL: My entire command, with baggage and ammunition, is nearly across the Big Black, including 100,000 pounds of bacon. Please do not send your dispatches by the Rocky Springs road, as they may be intercepted, but send by a road north of the Big Black. We have had cannonading and sharpshooting with the enemy most of the day.

W. W. LORING.

[P. S.]-I hear of an advance on the Jackson road; how far, I am unable to say. I will order a movement as soon as possible to the railroad bridge; in the meantime, I recommend that the command there be put into position.

Vicksburg, May 3, 1863.

Majors MEMMINGER and MIMS, Jackson:

Order all available cavalry to operate east of Big Black and on line of enemy thence to Port Gibson.

J. C. PEMBERTON.
