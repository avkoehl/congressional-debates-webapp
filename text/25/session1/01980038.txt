APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Sept. 1837
Postponement of fovrth instalment.—Mr. Jones.
H. of Reps.
poies That gentleman, upon his. basis of calcula-
tion, makes the surplus m the Treasury on the 1st
day of January, 1838, more than twenty millions
of dollars, and I show a deficit of almost as large
an amount
[Here Mr Bell «¡aid, the gentleman from Vir-
ginia did him injustice m supposing fhrt they had
ved at such opposite conclusions from the same
*iYri        it, that the surplus shown by him Mas
docvune .      f aione from what appeared m the re-
pr°^ thrgec^tary, but by going out of that
port ot the Seci       J            gentleman from Vir-
SKandSS?hen refiere very nearly the
SaMr] Chairman, I will never, mten tonally, do m-
1Ustice to the member from Tennessee eJher here
or elsewhere, and if he had exercised a little pa-
tience, I should very soon have relieved him from
all apprehensions on that subject, as it w-s my in-
tention to present the principal points ot diflcience
between us, that the committee might have avoid-
ed lo them an opportunity of deciding for them-
selves w ho it was that had fallen into ei roi
The first position taken bv the gentleman from
Tennessee (Mi Bell) was, that the sum of five
millions of dollars, which appeared to be m the
hinds oí disbursing officers of the Government, wis
subject to the contiol of the Secistarj, an! shou'd
be regarded as so much money in the Tieasmy
That this amount cannot be regaided as money m
the Treasury is obvious, because it had been drawn
out by those officers of the Government, on whom
the authority was conferred, to meet appropriations
made by law, and wa=> not, in point ot lact, m the
Treasury at the time the report was made This I
re°aril as a very sufficient a'iswer to the ground
«inch la- been «lied on Agi.n the five
millions of dolíais i  the hands of these <H-
bursing otheers must be mcl ided, either m the
expenditures for the first hall of the piesent year,
or else in the estimated expenditures of the list
half, and consequently cannot change the tesult,
shown by the report of the Secretary, at the close
ot the year But, sir, I have looked bick into the
past history of the Government, and I believe that
no period can be pointed to when there was not a
very large amount in the hands of disbursing offi-
c is How cotild it be otherwise'' The officers
and soldiers of the army have to be paid through
hen p jinisters, those of the navy thiough then
puis is pensions to be satisfel tit Hits carind
into execution, and contm ts. to be complied with
Iii w iiet'iesMhingstobedo le, without passmgoier
into tin hands of disbursing officeis money foi the
wpns '' It is Hue that (he amount in the hands
', ..«<, pfheers is large, but not so taige as it was
dmmg the early Tm oi lbeJeaT> as afPeare(1 \a
o e tecent report of the Secretary, lying en the
ables ol membeis, and which had been called for
bv the gentleman from Tennessee, and certainly
not more than would seem to be necessary n h ix
t «as lecollected that the amount appropriated by
( on-uess at the last ses ion, exceeded thirtj-two
ni'líor s of dollar, and that to be disbursed in al-
most evety section of the Union

Bell) has a^o amended, mat th estimates of le-

<irter extending the payments on duty bonds, bs-
yond the present veai, as pi oponed bj a bill w hich
lias passed the Senate, that the íeceipts into the
Treasury for the last half jeai, will not exceed
§4 500,000 But the gentleman f om Tennessee to
produce his surplus, estimates them at $10,000,000,
makiig a difference between his estimates,
and those of the Secreta'y, of §3,500,000 which
I consider a fair deduction from the amount of
suiplns which he supposes will be in the Tiea-
surv at the close of the present }eai
The gentleman from Tennessee (Air Bell) has
presented to the committee a statement of items ol
appropna'ion, for the present year, amounting to
moie than six millions of dollars fiv e millions oi
which, he contends, may be retrenched, w ithout in-
justo ft e public interest Thej aie appropna-
tions for the building oi light-houses, beacons, b loys,
the improvement of i iv eis, harbors, &c
I concur, sir, entirely with the membti from
Teui esses, in his opposition to this whole class ot
appiopricitions, and, wuh him, have uniformly
voted against them I am opposed to mc-t of
them upon constitutional grounds, but, if I enter-
t lined no doubt upon the constitutional question,
still 1 should have been opposed to them, because
thev lead to was'efnl and extiavagant expenditures
of the public monev, md if the mcmbei iiom
Tennessee «ill dfvise some pian, submit some
piacticable scheme, by which Urn can be leached,
I will most willingly co operate with him in the
accomplishment ol the object he has in view
Bulls that to be expected? h?tewe not had the
aid ot the talent and ablitvot that gentleman in
resist ng the veiv laws which provide for these ap-
propriations' have they not been lesisted bv us
both, at evciv stage? and can he have foigotten
the snid'l mmoiitvm which we foil d ourselves
on ever} ques oi! How, then, can he now ex-
pect to succeed m cutting down th se expendi-
tures, when he has so s gnally failed in resisting
the laws which provide for 'hem Should he make
the attempt, he would, in all probability, be told
that some ot these works were commenced, some
completed, and that otheis were unaei contiact
Su, the golden hmvest is maturing, and carefully
watched ovei, by those into whose giananes it is
destined to go
I shall notice but one other item m the state-
ment which has been submitted by the honoiable
ge-nllemaa from Tennessee, (Mr Bell,) and that is
the item of '¿13,000,C00, based upon the supposed
issue ot Tieasurv notes to that ai íount He main-
tains that if the bill authorizing the í^sue of Trea-
suiy notes to the amount of §12,000,000 shall pass,
it vvill swell the suiplus m the Freasmy to moie
than <J20 000,000, «o that m older to make up this
vei} large amount of suiplus, the gentleman from
Tennessee is driven to the necessity of taking into
his estimate $12,000,000, which aie not only not in
the Tieasury, or undei the control of the Secicmy,
but which cinnot be placed there without creating
A debt, foi the pa} mont of which the people are to
be ultimately íesponsible, and here alh w me to
inquire whether it w as ev er i Hended by those wno
supported the deposite act to mcui a debt, in oider
to make the deposite with the Stales' To that
mqiiii   1 am well assured thpt all will ans vei no
If then, Mi Cnanman, I ha,e «uccec'ed in
snow n<  that the souices tolled upon bv th gen-
tleman from Tennessee are deceptive and fallacious,
1 mus , I think, ha e succeeded in esi"bhsl mg tv

bidder, and the proceeds  of sale passed ovei to
the States, under the deposite act of Juue, 1836.
I am opposed, Mr Chairman, to the proposition of
the gentleman fiom Kentucky, foi reasons which I
w ill proceed veiy briefly to assign, in the first place
I am opposed to it, because I am unwilling to see
the Treasury ol the United Sia'es converted into a
shav nig shop, and also because of a conviction
upon my own mmd, that if they shall be disposed
oí in the way pioposed, it is scaicely to be hoped
that thev will command then full value For at
no former period of oui history, has theie been a
time when the derangement in the moneyed con-
cerns of the country had been so universal, at no
time have the people been borne down oy so heavy
a weight of debt, at no time has it been moie diffi-
cult to command money The cry every wheie tobe
htaid is, relief, relief Let these bond^ then be
brought into the maiket at such a time, and
under such encumstances, and who aie to be
}our bidelers' where is the man or set of
men to be lound, who can advance two
millions of dollars to make the purchase! They
may be called loi, but it will be like railing spirits
from the vasty deep they will not come One bid-
der there will be—the Bank of the United States,
and unless the agent authoii7ed to make the sale
shall be laid under conditions, the bank will dictate
the teims, and become the puichaser at its own
pr ce
Again the Secielaiy of the Tieasury, in leply
to the mquin, "What oojects of public expendi-
t'ue can, with the least injur} to the public service,
be eitnei wholly dispensed with during the present
yeai, orbeai anj mater al reduction'" has informed
U3 that enoagh of it could and woul 1 be postponed
till the next j eai to amount to about fitteen mil-
lions of dol¡ars, but that sum will still remain a
chaige upon tne Trea^tiy, to be paid out of the
acciumg revenue for the next year, or piovidedfor
in some other mode , and if the bonds due by the
bank be now sold, and the proceeds deposited with
the Slates, the strong probability is, that the Govern-
ment will bednven to the necessity of resorting
to an additional loan to meet the demands upon it
If, then, it weie in the power of the Secretary to
contiol the ivbole amount now on deposite with
the banks, and which is known to be there locked
up and vhollv unavailable, such has turned out to
be the reduction of the revenue, fiom various
sources, during the piesent yeai,*and such the crip-
pied condition if the finances, growing out of the
embarrassed situation of the mercantile eommuni-
tv, which has lendeied necessaiy an extension of
the time of pa}in nt upon their bonds, that it is
not possible to make the transfer of the fourth in-
stalment of the suiplus revenue to the States with-
out mom ung a naiional debt The surplus expected
to have been m the Tieasury on the 1st of Octo-
ber, in point ot lact, is not there, nor are there any
means at the eontiol of the Government with which
to meet the demand It wou'd seem lo me, there-
tore, that the necessity has arisen when it would
become the duly of the Secretary, (if the whole
amount had been paid over to the States,) to re-
quneits repayment up n the teims prescribed m
the act of June, 1836.
Tlavirg now show n as I think I have done, that
the necessity ex sts, 1 siall proceed to examine 'he
auestion whethe. Congress can rightfully exercise
the fowei to c ntiol the fourth instalment, as the
bill untie consi leration piop' ses This leads me
t e\an me foi i mome t the deposite act of June,
