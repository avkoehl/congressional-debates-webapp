THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
January 26,
Then I say that the United States, the trus-
tee of such splendid, such grand powers and
duties, is disregarding them and meddling with
the election of constables in Tennessee 1 It is
not coining much money, but it is issuing a
great man^shinplasters ; it is not declaring war
neither is it making peace.
Now let us look a little at the expense of
keeping up this system. How much do the
people pay annually to support what they would
so much like to rid themselves of? The re-
ported expenses are as follows:
Collecting the revenue 12,120,771 84
Administering  1,132,585 08
Assessing  4,848,770 00
Total $8,102,126 92
To this large sum must be added many con-
tingent expenses, not easily computed, which
will swell it considerably.
But I am answered by saying that we admit
much that you say: " This is a bad thing, pro-
ductive of much evil, but it is a necessity; we
cannot help it; we must submit." I say no ; it
can be blotted out.
The Secretary of the Treasury makes the
following e stimate of receipts and expend-
itures for the fiscal year ending June 30,
1872:

The balance in the Treasury on the 1st Jan-
uary, 1871, wasâ€”
Coin  $107,802,280 95
Currency    30,284,291 49
Total  $138,086,572 44
The sum estimated for receipts from sales
of stamps on writings is, in round numbers,
$15,000,000.
Thetotal estimated revenue being... $320,418,000 00
deduct therefrom thesum estimated
from internal revenue  126.418,000 00
And the balance is  191,000,000 00
Add the probable sum irom sale of
stamps  15,000,000 00
Revenue, according to estimates  $209,000,000 00
The expenditures are put down at $309,639,-
819 01, in regard to which the Secretary of
the Treasury, in his report, says:
"According to this estimate there will be a sur-
plus applicable to the payment of the principal of
the public debt, in addition to the payments innde
on that account through the sinking fund, of $10,778,-
68039. An analyses of the expenditures develops
f.scts tending: to sustain the opinion that the balance
will be considerably larger than appears from the
foregoing estimate. The sum of $22,338,278-37 is the
estimate for public works. The appropriations for
these objects ior the present year are less than twelve
million dollars, and it is reasonable to presume that
the appropriations for the next year will not much
exceed that amount. It is believed, also, that the
estimates made by the several Departments for the
different branches of the public service are tor the
maximum amounts, which will bo required under
any circumstances. If such isjbe case, there will
remain, on the 30th of June, 1872. unexpended bal-
ances to be covered into the Treasury. It may,
therefore, be reasonably anticipated that the total
reduction of the public debt during the next fiscal
year, including payments on account of the sinking
fund, will be about fifty million dollars."
With a balance ill the Treasury of $138,-
000,000, it is proposed to keep up a rate of
taxation which shall retain that balance, pay
so much of the public debt as the law requires
us to pay, and pay in addition more than
twenty-five million dollars! The people are
overwhelmed with taxes when millions are
lying, I had almost said, rotting in the Treas-
ury 1 The law creating the public debt required
that a certain part should be, in effect, paid
annually by the establishment of a sinking
fund. But to do this is not sufficient; that
much must be paid and much more besides.
Is this never to stop ? Is the day of retrench-
ment, reform, economy never to come? Are
we to keep on forever in the same wasteful
path, making a show of economy by removing
some item of expenditure, but immediately
adding another ?
Deduct from the estimated expenses, which
are $309,639,319 61, the followingitems, which
can certainly be spared, namely, the expenses
of the revenue department, $8,102,126 92;
and $12,000,000 which the Secretary thinks
will not be needed for improvements, and
there remains $289,537,292 69.
Admitting that all this is needed, and the
Secretary thinks it will not be, we can pay so
much as may be required beyond the income
of the Government, and still have a balance
in the Treasury of more than sixty million
dollars.
The expenditures of the Government up to
June, 1872, can be provided for as I have
indicated. Between this time and that, if, by
an economical administration of the Govern-
ment, it should be necessary to raise means
beyond the sources I point out, it can be done
by apportioning the sum to be raised equitably
among the States, and requiring each State to
collect its portion through the same machinery
by which it collects its own taxes, and pay over
to the United States Treasury.
The retention of the balance in the Treas-
ury is justified on two grounds: first, that the
coin must be kept there in order to return to
specie payments ; second, that it is necessary
to the maintenance of our creditabroad. The
first objection is easily answered. The Gov-
ernment is not paying specie, and does not
indicate any intention of a speedy return.
Therefore it is useless to keep money idle to
do what we are not doing. Nor is the second
ground valid. The credit of men, as well as
nations, depends upon two things: ability to
pay, and willingness to do it. If the world
knows that a nation can pay its national debt
and desires to preserve the national honor,
then be sure the credit of that nation is good.
Surely upon these points the world cannot
doubt as to the United States. This people
has demonstrated that the debt can be paid
and will be paid. More proof on this point is
superfluous. We need not keep so much money
always merely to show that we are going to do
what all the world knows already. An over-
flowing treasury is an invitation to extrava-
gance. With our pockets full we spend freely,
and will do so till we change our policy.
Mr. MORRILL, of Vermont. Mr. Presi-
dent, I do not rise to make any extended
remarks on this subject, nor with any expect-
ation of giving any information to the Senate
or of changing any votes. I am aware that
the Senate is not in a receptive mood, and I
always notice that when they have ceased to
listen to debate it is a fair indication that the
minds of the Senate are made up, and that
no vote can be changed by any subsequent
speeches here. But, sir, I desire to 'make a
few suggestions in relation to this question at
the present moment, in order to put myself
fairly upon the record.
It seems to me we are about to vote a want
of confidence in the Secretary of the Treasury,
a vote which if given in England would cause
the ministry to retire at once. What is it we
are called upon to do? It is to cut down the
resources which the Secretary of the Treasury
says are indispensable to the conduct of his
Department. Are we to accept the estimates of
any gentleman as against the estimates of the
Secretary of the Treasury ? While [ very much
fear that the Secretary of the Treasury has
sinned away the day of grace as to funding the
national debt at a lower rate of interest, yet he
has so many decided points of merit that I shall
be very reluctant indeed to have a vote given
here that will imply any want of confidence in
his official declarations ; declarations made
upon the fullest information, and, as I think,
with the strictest integrity as to the resources
of the Government and its requirements, ad
justed upon the most economical basis.
Mr. President, if we take the estimates as
submitted on the 1st of December, or those of
more recent date, which were exhibited with
so much force yesterday by the chairman of
the Committee on Finance, it is clear that the
revenue derived from the income tax is indis-
pensable, or if repealed that it should be made
up from some other quarter. Have we any
reason to expect that it will come from some
other quarter ? No. sir. We have the state-
ment of the new Commissioner of Internal
Revenue, showing that at least one third of
the revenue from spirits is likely to fall off.
In a moral point of view that is not to be re-
gretted, if the consumption is decreasing, but
it must be considered financially. Then take
the tariff. We know that during the months
of August, September, and October foreign
merchandise from Germany and France and
Europe generally flooded the markets of our
country. Tliey emptied their workshops of
whatever they had to spare in order to raise
money for the exigencies of the war that they
were embarking upon, and we may, therefore,
fairly conclude that the revenues of the coun-
try in the last part of the past year were in
excess of what they will be for the year to
come.
Our imports have been so excessive as to
produce a heavy fall in the prices of mer-
chandise. The result has in many cases
proved unprofitable to trade. Many merchants
have failed in consequence. I would not
prophesy anything of a desponding character.
I expect that our revenues will be very con-
siderable; but I do not expect that they are
to cintinue at the same full flood we have
witnessed for the past six months. The first
month oftheyearit is likely that a large amount
of duties wifl be received on sugar, tea, and
coffee entered for consumption, because of the
reduction of duty which took place on the 1st
of January ; but after this no doubt there will
be a falling off.
Then again, it seems tobe entirely forgotten
that we have repealed numberless taxes, both
in the internal revenue and in the tariff, some
taking effect last summer and some, as I have
mentioned, on the first of the year, the results
of which we have j'et to witness. Before we
have time to see what the operation of the abo-
lition of the taxes that we have already repealed
at the last session of Congress will be, we are
called upon to strike a blow in the dark, or to
repeal a tax; amounting to twelve or fifteen
millions more, whether it can be spared or not.
Now, let me say in relation to this income
tax, since it has been so far changed and mod-
ified, since the exemptions have been made so
broad as to confine its operations to only a few
thousand persons, and to reduce its amount
by at least two thirds, I confess that I have
no particular affeetion for it. I take it as I
would a medicine, not with any appetite, but
becausc it seems necessary to health. I think
that an income tax, to be properly levied,
ought to be levied upon the incomes of all
persons, with only an exemption of the average
amount that men enrn by the labor of their
hands. All above thatâ€”earned by machinery
and by capitalâ€”I think should be subjected to
the tax, if anything is to be subjected to an
income tax. I know that an income tax is not
equal, and that rogues escape, but no more in
our country than in any other, if as much ;
and, at the longest, no one expects or perhaps
