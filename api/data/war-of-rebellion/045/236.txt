HARRISBURG, PA., June 20, 1863.

General MILROY, Bloody Run:

I think your selection good from the present. Rations will be up to-morrow or before. Send for ammunition. One hundred and fifty rebels were at McConnellsburg to-day. Our mountain men took some prisoners. General Kelley occupies Cumberland, and says that rebels are all along the south of the Potomac. I trust that you can prevent any force they may send from penetrating the country.

Move your cavalry to McConnellsburg. When in the passes there, you can determine from information what course to take. Report to me when you arrive at Chambersburg.
