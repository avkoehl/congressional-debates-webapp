Report of Colonel Thomas A. Davies, Sixteenth New York Infantry, commanding Second Brigade, Fifth Division, of skirmish at Fairfax Court- House, July 17.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND BRIGADE, FIFTH DIVISION,July 17, 1861.

Agreeably to General Orders, Numbers 9, the Second Brigade, commanded by me, consisting of the Sixteenth, Eighteenth, Thirty- first, and Thirty- second Regiments, and Company G, Second Artillery (Greene's eight battery), took the advance of the Fifth Division, moving on Fairfax Court- House by way of the old Braddock road south of the turnpike road. I found the road very difficult for heavy artillery and barricaded by tress felled across the road as often as once in a quarter of a mile, requiring the constant use of the pioneer corps. After passing very many of these barricades we came to a blind barricade directly across the road and evidently intended for artillery. After making reconnaissance we found a small picket posted behind it, when my advance pickets were ordered to charge and fire upon the, which they did, dispersing it under a running fire. No one on our side was injured, and we never turned aside to ascertain whether any of the enemy were killed
