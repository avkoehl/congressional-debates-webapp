JULY 1, 1864.

Major-General SCHOFIELD;

I have ordered General McPherson to send a division to you to start at 4 a.m., and have a copy of your dispatch to General Thomas.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE OHIO,July 1, 1864

Major General GEORGE H. THOMAS:

General Geary is not able to relieve Colonel Barter's brigade, of General Cox's division, which is on this side of Olley's Creek. It is important for me to have that brigade beyond the creek, as at best my line will be quite extended; but it will probably suffice if the brigade be relieved at any time during the day.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

(Copy sent to General Sherman.)
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE OHIO,In the Field, Ga., July 1, 1864- 9 p.m.

Maj General GEORGE STONEMAN,

Commanding Cavalry Corps, Department of the Ohio:

GENERAL: I have just received your dispatch of 6.15 p.m. I inclose one from General Sherman, giving his view, &amp;c.* Hascall has reached the cross-roads at Watson's and William Moss'. Butler connects with Hascall's right, but has not been able to advance is own right. It occurs to me that you might, according to General Sherman's plan, push a larger force down this side of Sweet Water, and press the enemy back, from the bridge at Sweet Water Town. However, I leave this for you to judge. I have not yet heard what is to be done to-morrow; will let you know as soon as I learn. Please send me a man to carry a dispatch to you. I doubt whether one of mine could find you.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. M. SCHOFIELD

Major-General, Commanding.
HDQRS. THIRD DIVISION, TWENTY-THIRD ARMY CORPS,Lynch's, Friday Evening, July 1, 1864.

Brigadier-General HASCALL,

Commanding Second Division:

GENERAL: My line of skirmishers connecting with Colonel Byrd's brigade is so long that I find it will be impossible for me to alter it to-night, and I must therefore request you to leave Colonel Hobson's line where it is till morning, as Colonel Cameron, has already eleven companies on the skirmish line toward my center. My whole skirmish line is over three miles long, and you will appreciate my embarrassment in keeping it up, to say nothing of adding to it.

Truly, yours,

J. D. COX,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
