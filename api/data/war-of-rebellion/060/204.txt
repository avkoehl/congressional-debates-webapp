of camp. Reached the Court-House at 9. 30 a. m. Soon after I received orders from General Hampton saying he would go to Junction, and I should return to camp if the enemy did not appear by noon. I moved several miles down the road on which the enemy was expected to return, and at 4 p. m. took up the line of march for camp.

In conclusion, I can only say that I cannot attach blame to my picket officer, who is now dead or in the hands of the enemy. He was without a doubt, in my opinion, the best picket officer in my brigade, and if I had been called upon for the most reliable officer in my command for any duty I should have selected this captain. To the treachery of some citizen, whose name I cannot learn, we are indebted for this move.

I have been thus prompt in forwarding this report, fearing blame might be attached to myself or my command.

I am, major, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

P. M. B. YOUNG,

Brigadier-General.

Major H. B. MCCLELLAN.

W. H. CHEEK,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.

MAJOR. The above statement contains the list of captured property as appeared by an inventory taken several days after the engagement. I would call you attention to the fact of the number of saddles, bridles, and halters being much less than the number of horses. When we know that the horses when captured were tied up and unsaddled, I can account for the difference only by the system of exchanges that we know is always practiced on such occasions.
