able to subsist very comfortably on the country. Not a man was lost and but few horses abandoned. Command returned in very good condition. I cannot speak too highly of the conduct of the men and efficiency of the officers. Particularly I would mention Lieutenant-Colonel Litchfield, commanding detachment of Seventh Michigan, and Captain Clark, commanding detachment of Fifth Michigan, both of whom rendered me most efficient service. Trusting that the results of the work are equal to the expectations of the commanding general.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. D. MANN,

Colonel Seventh Michigan Cavalry.

Captain JACOB S. GREENE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
