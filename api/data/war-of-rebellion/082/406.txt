General WEITZEL:

The firing is below us. The gun-boats have been all the p.m. shelling around Colonel Hill's position. His men fell back from the position taken at dark by my orders, as I had not men to re-enforce them sufficiently.

Brigadier-General.

General WEITZEL:

GENERAL: Captain Lubey informs me that another engineer officer is to come to this place to take charge of the new bridge. I would respectfully request that no other captain of engineers be sent to this place. Captain Lubey's company is sufficient to construct and take care of both bridges.

Your friend,

General FOSTER, Jones' Neck:

All right. Tell Captain Lubey I will order, as he desires, that company not to go, or to return if it has started or got there.
