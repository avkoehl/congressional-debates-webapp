which may affect my reputation and impair my usefulness in the service if the facts remain unpublished.

I therefore very respectfully request a Court of Inquiry to be convened to investigate the truth and object of these reflections.

I would further request that I should be honorably relieved from duty in the Army of the Cumberland [pending this investigation],* and that my assistant adjutant-general, James A. Lowrie, be granted leave of absence to aid me in preparing the necessary papers.

I have but one aide, who is totally+ ignorant of my official records.

Hoping that my past services and an attentive performance of duty may entitle my request to your official consideration and respect,++ I have the honor to remain, yours, very truly,

JAS. S. NEGLEY,

Major-General U. S. Volunteers.

The general commanding directs that you remain in Nashville until further orders. It is proper that you should ask for a Court of Inquiry. It would not be proper to assign you to a command until an investigation has been had.
