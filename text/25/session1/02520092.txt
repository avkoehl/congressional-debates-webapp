worthy of remark,  that  the  Constitution of the
United Siales, so far as can be gathered from the
instrument itself, nowhere, but in th  section under
consideration, enioins the petfoi maree of a "specific
duty   on   the   State  Legislating   while   at   th 
same time, it retains to Congress ibe po ver to do
and undo, at pleasuie, the \ cry duty  requued of
the lespeetive States    The mes stable ctncluson
to be drawn fiom mis facf i , tha* the ñaméis (f
the Constitution regarded, with intense niterc t, the
necessity and propriety oí oigauu ng the leg lahve
department ot the Federal Government accoicung
to some limit rm rule oí law in each biate    The
legislative department ot Government, so e-senti?l
to  the happine s of the people, so indispensable
to regular  gsv eminent, we   can  well imagine
justly claimed fiom the gr°at men who gave birth
to our Federal Constitution, then most undi\ ided
and patient consideration    Upon the oiganuition
of the representative  branch of Congress essen-
tially depended the gicat expenmeit ot free go-
vernment     Hov evei wise the balance of powei,
as respect  the Judicial and Ex cutive depar nenls
of the Government, however restricted  and regu-
lated  by constilulional law,   the   framei    of this
instrument could but ha\e ftreseen the necessity
of learns no 1 ing to el anee as reíale  to the loi na-
tion of he popular bia ch of Con^rcs     In sul rml
ting these views, I claim no moiefor thissecti >n i nn
was asked for b} my iuerd from Virginia (Vh
Pennj backer) for the 31 section of the same articl 
If, then, sn, we go by the lettti or the inten ion Oi
4ih section it seems to me equally cleai thai, m that
section, and the laws of the lesptctive States pissed
m puKitance ol ti e same, ire we alont to find the
true channel lhiough which ill membei'- composing
this House must cr ter     But sn   it is not alene the
mode bj which memb   s ire lo c< i chcte, th it Ins

they  must  also have certain quahdc tiois alt r
getting here, without which, however reguhr their
election, they cannot exeicise the iieht of a repre-
sentative on this flooi     Su, the Constitution pio-
\ides that "no persen shall be a lepre-mtitive,
who shall not have a tamed to the age oí twenty-
five 3 e rs, and been s(.ven yeais a citi/en oí the
"United State*, and who shall not, when elected, be
an inhabitant of the State in which  he shall be
chosen "   Will it bt contended bv any one that w e
can disregard eiliiei or all ot the above quahfio-
lions?    Could     e   si i   say,  bv  t decision of tl is
House,  that   imtmbei  retained I en i ot twenty-
hveycdis of age, should le k <o0nised "s i repre-

we disregaid the mode prescribed with equal cei-
tamty in the ¡same msti umeiitf   II the qualificai ion
of age  and cili/cnship be  nccessaiv in  the   one

let me ?sk, gives ofiici il eha icter to the merrbeis
of this House''   What is it that gives them the
power oí speaking m tie name and in  behalf of
the pee p'e?   Why can they speik au hoi tat \ elv ,
and bind not only the r constituents, but those w>-o

we ce j„e here without t e  requisite  qualifications,
(in i ma mer different fiom  that  prescribed  bv
the Constitute n, and the bus oí  ihe States passed
in pursuance thereof, we are not heie as repre-
sentatives of the people, but as private individuals,
u iauthori"d to speak m tnetr name The acts we
would do, would be oui own—not binding on us,
much less upon the people Sir, it w ould have been
w orse than folly to hav e thiow n around the person of
the represéntate e, the qualification oí age and resi-
dence, in tirdcrto insure discrete and community
of interest be'vveen the constituent body and the re-
piescntative, unle s jou steadily adhtie to that por-
tion of the Corasí tution, whicn, accoictmg to the
ldi-i and spirit, intends to give notice to the voter
of the time, manner, and place, he may exercise

Mr Speaker, fiom what 1 have said, it seems to
me I have estabhsl ed that the object of the fourtn
section of the fust article of the Constitution, «as
the establishment b liw m acn State, of atime cer-
tain, plates p blic and notoritus and amodestea-
ch and nniiorm, whereby the qualified voters of
Ihe most numerous branch of the State Legislature,
could exercise the right of voling for membeis of
this bo ly, as sec tied to them under the Constitu
Hon
This bru o me now   to the inqmrv whether the

close of the 25ih Con^re«s     I y ill not trouble the
Hou e but with one oi two lemti'is inoie, on this
branch of the subject     Of tht motives of the Exe-
cutive of Mississippi I know nothing, bu% sir, I
must confess, no matter what tne decision oí this
House may be, lhat I am at ? loss to undersiancl
why he should have adopted the course he has
thought proper lo puisue, full of dangei, as he
must have foreseen, when he had at his command
a remedy adequate to the emergency
Mr Speaker, I will return to the considei ation of
the latter part oí the second section of the fir t arti-
e'e of the Constitution, lehed on by the friends of
ihe repoi t    Let us examine this provision of the
Consiitut on    It reads as follow s  " When v acari-
cies happen in the repiesentation fiom any Stale,
the Executive autlnuly thereof shall issue w uts ot
election  to  fill such vacancies"    Si, vou have
heaid much si d in debate as lo the tiue significa-
tion of the word ' happen "    I will not prete .J to
take part in this contest    I  w ill leav c it ft r other
gentlemen to consult the lexieographeis of this or of
a íolher age, as to the  true  meani  {  of the uoid
' happen "    To  i iy mind, sir,   it  is oí no conse-
quence vvheth r the one oi the otnci of the v ¡eyy s of
the gentleman from Virginia, (Mr   Pennjbacker,)
or the ¿en leman  fiom Tennessee, (Mi Maury,)
be concce     I shall meet ibe question bioadly, dis.
c'aimmg an}   distinction between a \acaney that
ma} happen, oi one that exists,   My lemarks shall
I    be directo 1 to the lnqun <, xv hether, 11 pom* of If gal
j    fact, a vacanc} existed at the time the election for
I    membeis   to   tne Twenty-fifth  Congress from the
Stale of Mississippi too' place     If, su, if be tiue
that a vacancy at that time existed—I mean a va-
cancj in the(repiesentation from Miss ssippi, undei
the Constitution of the Un'ted States, and the law s
of said State, passed in pu suance iheieoi—then ti e
light ot the honorable gentlemen (Messrs Gholson
and Claiboinc)  to  a seat on  this floor can not
be   questioned     But,   on  Ihe   other hand   if no
such vacancy   existed,   they   have  come to th s
hall, not m   pursuance of law, but against law
Let us, sir, look for a moment to the express lan-
guage ol the Constitution, "when vacancies happen
in the lcpresentation fiom any Stale "   Can lan-
guage be more explicit1 Is there a man whose mind
has not been croxvded wilh too mucn learning, that
can doubt as to the distinct idei, intended to be
conveyed by thelramers of this instrument?   Does
it not mean precisely what the ordinary accepta-
tion of the woids conveys to evei} intelligent mind?
Mr Speaker, I may be  too old fashioned m my
notions on  ihis subiect     rt may be  thai the lan-
guage of the day  when this  instrument vvaa fram-
|    ed, is nt t  the   same of the  piesent day     It may
be, sn, lhat  when the framers of this instiument
I    said o íe  thing, the} meant another, but for one I
|   shall  l ike xvhat  ihev did say, as the best evidence
tf what the}   meant    Then,  sir, the}   have sml,
thr>t when vacancies hapjjen  in the iepresentatu n
from   a Slate,  " the Ext cutive   autnoiitv theieof,"
I    shall putorm a ceitani  duty      What is understood
I    by the term repiesentation   frcm   a Stic'    Does it
mean the office of rcpiesentauv O Or does it n ean
the per ons who ma} be chosen as l  picseniatives?
Who, sir, constitute the leore^entaticnfiom theS ate
of Georgia in this House' Nine individuals,and these
|    n ne lnehv id lals compose the  representation from
I     he St-'te of  Georgia     How is  it that those nine
individuals compose lh" rtptesentatiop from Greor-
!   gia7   When,   sn    they were du'y elected mem-
J    ocis of the 25th Congress, urdpr trie ]<„vv of Geor-
gia Ixmg the Urn s, places and manner of holding

I    an official character, and then it vv as, and not until
!    then, that they collectively constituted the íeprc-
|   s ntation fiom Georgia     Well, sir, having shown
what is meant by this 'eim,  " representation," as
'   thus used  m the Constituí on, it lemains on'y to
be shown what is meant by the word "vacancy"
in the same clause    Ir, sir, ' amcoirect m what
I have said of the true meaning ef tne words le-
presentation fiom a State, it will tollo , as a ne-
cessary consetiuence, tna the v ord " vacancy' has
