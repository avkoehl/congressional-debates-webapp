It is also proper to refer to the payment made
by Mr Ogden, of $30,000, to the Solicitor of the
Treasury, as being a deduction to be made from
the amount due from Mr Swartwout It was not,
howevei, a sum standing m the name of the latter
os collector, or forming any portion of either of
these funds; it was money in the possession of
Mr Ogden, but admitted by him to have been re-
ceived from Mr Swartwout, and which he volun-
tarily paid over to the United States
The remaining fund, the deficiency which makes
up the whole debt of Mr Swartwout, is the "bond
account " By Mr Swartwout's returns to the
Treasury Department, it appears that when his
term of aífiee expned he was chargeable with
$8,994,666 59 of bonds for duties not paid into
the Treasury. Of these, he transferred to his
successor, the present collector, $6,045,386 13,
constituting the portion of these bonds not yet
due, or unpaid. He also accounted for a further
portion, amounting to $2,302,525 63, as ha\mg
been sent to the district attorney for suit This
leaves the sum of $646,754 83, being the aggregate
of the deficit in Mr Swartwout's bond account
On examination, we ascertained that of this aggre-
gate the amounts that became due were as follows
In the year 1837, the sum of.......$611,299 93
And ¿n the first quarter of 1838......     2,504 28
Making together..................613,804 21
Of the remaining sum of............   32,950 62
which is necessary to make up the . .$646,754 83*
we were unable to ascertain the particulars It
may consist of bonds not accounted for at earlier
periods, and though it may ultimately be traced
out, this cannot be done without a thorough ex
animation of the bond account, from the com
mencement of Mr  Swartwout's term
It Will be seen that this deficit in the bond ac
count first occurs in the year 1837 Shortly after
its commencement, Mr Phillips, the assistant
cashier, kept a list for his own satisfaction (as he
stated) of a large number of these bonds, which
iad been paid, and the money received by Mr
Swartwout It amounts altogether to $597,331 63
When the bond account came to be finally adjusted,
in the summer of 1838, by Mr Fleming, the aud-
itor of the custom house during the latter part of
Mr Swartwout's term, he received from Mr Phil
lips the original list thus made out and kept, and
found it to agree, as far as it went, with the defi-
ciency in the bonds which he had ascertained him-
self, and to which he had called Mr Swartwout's
attention It fell short, however, of the whole
amount of the deficiency in the bond account of
the year 1837, and the first quarter of 1838, by
$ 16,472 58, but the particulars of this lattei sum
Mr Fleming obtained, so as to make the whole
amount of the bond account chargeable to Mr
Swartwout during that period, $613,804 21, as
before stated An explanatory communication
of Mr Fleming, relative to the bond account, to-
gether with the list made by Mr Phillips, will be
found among the documents transmitted to you
It will thus be seen that the deficit of Mr Swart-
wout exists in the following different funds
Tonnage duties..................      $1,783 24
Forfeitures......................      39 833 12
Treasury warrants.............      39,240 05
Officeexpenses...............      60 29142
Cash to be refunded to merchants .      80 769 53
Cash to meet "piotests".........     192,866 4b
Cash deposited to meet unascertained
duties.........................    164,177 04
Bondaccount....................    646,754 83
$1,225,705 69
The length and laborious nature of this investi-
gation, added to the steps which have been neces-
sary to secure for the United States, as far as
could be done, the property of Mr Swartwout
and his sureties, has left us but little opportunity
to offer for your consideration any suggestions as
to the best mode of preventing for the future sim-
ilar defalcations Such suggestions, too, must
mainly depend opon the general plan that ¡t may
be deemed expedient to adopt, and will essentially
vary, as that may be the formation of a new sys-
tem for-the collection and safe-keeping of the rev-
enue derived from customs, or the mere substitu-
tion of certain changes in that which at present
exists
It will, however, be perceived at once,from the
facts communicated, that the success which has
attended the present defalcation, and its long
concealment, may be attributed in a considerable
degree to defects incident to the present system
These defects are, mainly, tnat the same officer
(the collector) ascertains the suras uue to the
Government for duties, reports them himstlf to
the Treasury, collects, the money for them, re
ports the sums collected, and makes and reports
all the expenditures charged upon them before
they go into the Treasury, that large sums of
public money are retained for long periods by the
collector, as funds under his exclusive control,
and that there are no inspections, regular or occa-
sional, into the books and proceedings of the sev-
eral custom-houses, now directed by law
These defects readily suggest the following
remedies*
1   That the system for the collection of revenue
from customs should resemble that adopted in
regard to the revenue from lands, that the officer
who ascertains the amount due to the Govern-
ment, admits vessels to entry, and performs the
various functions connected with those parts of
a collector's duty, should be distinct from, and
independent of, the officer who receives and is
accountable for the moneys accruing on those
duties Each making his separate reports, and
held to a separate responsibility, would prove a
complete check upon the other, and lead to an
immediate detection of error, neglect, or defalca-
tion
2   That all sums of money should be paid into
the Treasury, that no officer should be permitted
to retain funds, under any pretext, or make pay-
ments, except on estimates previously made to the
Treasury, or on accounts properly submitted and
examined There would be no difficulty in so
arranging this plan as to give quite as much fa-
cility as exists at present in the payment of de-
bentures, and all other charges now deducted from
the accruing levenue, while it would obviate the
disadvantages that are inseparable from the pies-
ent mode
3   That actual insDections by competent officers
from the Tieasury bepartment should be made
from time to time, at every principal custom-house
Had such inspections been made at New York,
this defalcation could have been easily detected
before it had long existed, or reached any very
consideiable amount
4   That the use of the public money by any offi-
cer intrusted with its collection, safe keeping, or
disbursement, should be made a criminal offense,
severely punishable
We are, very respectfully, yours,

REMARKS OF HON. R. STRANGE,
OF NORTH CAROLINA,
In Senate, December 21, 1838,
In reply to Mr Davis's charge of Extravagance
against the friends of the Administration
Mr STRANGE said
I was very unfortunate, Mr President, in not
being in my seat when the Senator from Massa-
chusetts commenced his remarks in reply to a
few words which fell from me the other day, but
having heard a part only of those remarks, I must
endeavor to make the best replication to them that,
under the circumstances, may be in my power It
cannot be expected that I shou'd do justice either
to the subject or myself, in thus promptly answer-
ing what, it is evident, has been prepared with
hours of labor and premeditation, and the omy
support and source of confidence I possess is, that
I have tiuth and justice on my side.
It is a great advantage in argument for «man
to be allowed to state the proposition involved in
the controversy according to his own fancy; and
very few can resist the temptation of So stating it
as, in their estimation, to facilitate very mueh the
task of sustaining their own side of the argument.
The Senator from Massachusetts has, oti tins
occasion, availed himself fully of this advantage,
and laid down a very different proposition from
the one I endeavored to maintain on the occasion
to which the Senator has done me the honor to
refer I took the hbe.ty, in an early Stage of his
address to the Senate, to call his attention to thfe
inaccuracy into which he was falling, bat, unfor-
tunately, without avail, and it now becomes
necessary for me, tn the first place, to correct
his statement of the question He has assumed
that the proposition he was called upon to main-
tain was, that the Opposition was not exclusively
resoonsible for the^expenditures of the Govern-
ment; attributing to me the assertion that they
were, and assuming, further, that I made that
assertion in the character of an assailant, whereas
the truth is, the attitude in which I stood was that
of a defendant, denying the truth of the imputa-
tion coming from the other side, that the present
Administration was ehaigeable with all the ex-
travagance of public expenditure My allegation
was, that there had been, and still was, a lavish,
expenditure of the public money, but that the
Administration, and the friends of the Adminis-
tration in this House, could not justly beicharge&
with the guilt of these expenditures, for that ap-
propriations were generally carried bf some few
friends of the Administration (who, as a body,
were in favor of low taxation and moderate ex-
penditure) joining themselves to the mass of the
Opposition, (who were, on the contrary, as a.
body, in favor of high taxation and lavish ex-
penditure ) I protested against the Opposition
i charging the Administration with extravagance,
while almost every expenditure was voted for by
the mass of their own body, opposed by the
friends of the Administration as a class, and car-
ried by a few of them in almost every instance,
who, under some peculiarity of opinion in rela-
tion to the particular subject, the wishes or sup-
posed interests of their constituents, or some
other consideration, supported the appropriation
with the mass of the Opposition, and thus effected
its passage I read some passages from the Jour-
nal of the Senate of the last session, in proof of
my position, and left it to the country to decide
whether my conclusion was just or erroneous. I
did nothing more. But one who has heard th«
long series of remarks made by the Senator in
reply, and his frequent allusions to what I said,
might justly suppose that I had delivered to the
Senate a long harangue, whereas I can safely
appeal to those who heard me, whether I detained
the Senate beyond a few moments
I am not ignorant that there is some little diffi-
culty in assigning to gentlemen in this body their
proper places in the political ranks Some, it is
true, are obviously and confessedly the friends of
the Administiation, and others as palpably its
opponents, but there are others whose position
is not so well defined The other day I felt so
strongly the delicacy of "aying of some gentlemen
whether they were the friends of the Administra
tion or its opponent"?, that I forbore the under-
taking If 1 said they were opponents of the
Administration, I was fearful of giving offense by
what would piobably be considered as denuncia-
tion, and if 1 should say they were fuends of the
Administration, I was equally feartul of firing
their independent souls with indignation at the
supposed injustice of ranking them among " the
vassals of the President " There are gentlemen
in this body claiming, I believe, to constitute "an
armed neutrality " Of what number it consists,
is a question oí very delicate decision, and when
that decision is made, it is still more difficult to
define their position Judging by their conduct,
however, they ought not to complain if they are
ranked with the Opposition, for although a party
may assume a neutiai flag, if it is found continually
pouring a hot file into the ranks of one belligerent,
and never leveling a hostile gun m the direction
of the other, it would not be thought unreasonable
in those thus constantly assailed to look upon it
