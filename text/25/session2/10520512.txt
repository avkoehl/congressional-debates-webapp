take the public land, and humbly piay for the light of pre
cmptfon, tins yielded, they call the Government a step mothei,
and demand vauons grants and immimitus, th?n they foice
themselves into the Union, without complying with the act of
Congress, and leaching the climax of impudence, they boldly
threaten to deprive the old tetates of all share m the national
domain But we are asked, what must be done? Twenty
thousand people ate living on the west side of the Mississippi,
and the wholearmyof the United States could notdnve them
from their settlements I> it come to thn? \ private citizen
can enforce his rights, by appealing to tLe courts of justice,
and yet the Government which i ule  and protects all, cannot
keep intruders from the public land, and is not able to save
the property of the people1 If this be so, out fatheis labored
in vain, if the moral and physical powei of our institutions be
so weak, they aie not worthy ol preservation Mr ¡3 had not
yet lost faith in the \ irtue and nuplligence oi the country, the
fault was not with the people, but the politicians, who ar& con
tmually struggling to advance themselves by pandemia to «very
prejudice, and using all means to acqune popularity The

the law, hut he who seeks foi place will sacuhce the interests
of the nauon, and sink the dignity ef the Government, to ob

These outrages aie still moie inexcusable when it is íemem
beredthattheie aie eighty millions ol acies, oi evtny variety
of soil and climate, now open to entiy, and the plea of neces

subject—que lions winch affect the destiny of this great peo
pie, though the dm of political wailaie and the exciting
stiuggles of personal nvalry m#y cause othei topics for a tune
to engioss public attention When Virginia ceded the North

than three Stares should be loimed eut ol it, and that they
should be admitted into the Union when then population
amounted to sixty thousand souls Thn compact has been

neral Government has been of the mildest and most paternal
chaiacter rtie building up of new unpuea in the shonest

beautiful lands were sold for a mile tube altei tube ofna
Uves disappeaied, and the white mm was on their heeH, houu
ties of immense value weie given foi bchools and internal mi
provement Scarcely any request ol the settleis was denied,
«o anxious was the Government to encourage emigration, and
to people these vast legioui The effect of this legislation was
in igical, thousands ami tens of thousands left their homes m the
Eaat for the fértil  valleys of the West This was not the sur
plua population, not the oveiflowings of a redundant commu
nity, but the bs i© and sinew of the land and in many cases l's
■wealth and intelligence Thus have ansen those thuvmg and
powerful States, <vhieh have already outstripped most of their
elder sisters The tamo policy his been pursued towards the
new States of the Sot thwest By the Ueaty with Fiance we
stipulated to extend to the people of the Louisiana lerntory all
the rights of citizenship This has been done Louisiana,
Missouri and Aikansaw have been successively admitted intu
the Union, and they have become great and Houiiihmg com

If the Territory of Iowa be now established, it wdl soon be
come a State, if we now cross the Mississippi, under the boun
tifttl patronage of this Goverpmeut, the cupidity and enteiprise
of outpeoplewili cany the sjsem still furthei, and ere long
the Rocky Mountains will he scaled, and the valley ol the ( o
luntbia bs embraced in out dominion 1 his, then, is the time
to pause, togathei the results of pipvious experience, ami to
conaiderthe influence of this legibiaiion on the ehuactet of tho
people and the duiability of our institution^
The strength of a nation does not consist m the extent of its
territory Population diffused ovm a eieat surface is neitnei as
rich nor as ^oweiful as when condensed in nauuwei limits,
and engaged m the various employments of human in lustry
Cities fitted with aitisans and the soil worked by numerous
agriculturists, cause the pioduition of more wealth than if the
same people were scatlei ed i v ei a widei i egion The m inds ol
men, when constantly biought mto collision and struggling foi
pre eminence, are more active, more luutlul of expedients, and
jnore apt to make those gieat inventions which inciease the
comforts of life and exalt the character of a people If all the
land of a country be occupied, new modes of agriculture will be
discovered to increase tho productive energies ot the soil, or
those whose labor is not needed in the field will go to the ocean oi
the workshop, and this natural division of industry will make
each claw more skilful and richer than il all were confined to
the original employment over a larger space
The resources of «. dense population aie moie available ana
more easily brought into the service of the Government than
those of a scattered people Ifiaxes be imposed, they dre levied
with quickness and facility if physical strength be requued, it
is concentrated with despatch, and made to operate with vigor,
if intellectual qualities be desned, they are quickly found, ana
directed to the public welfare To prove the truth of this
theory^ let England and Russia be compared, one is a meie
speck m the ocean, but ciowded with thriving and industrious
people, the other occupies a portion of two continents, with a
population of fifty millions spread over its immense territory
The power of the former is felt m the i emntfwt corners of the
«ftrth, the latter is feared by the savage hordes within its own
limité, and hangs like a dark cloud over its weaker neighbors
England commands the treasury of the commercial woild,
Russia, with its rich soil and hidden wealth, is pooi, and depen
dent on the «miles of foreign bankers and capitalists In an
instant the former can buckle on her armor, and strike an
enemy before he thinke of preparation, she can ffv fiom point
to point with the speed and fury of lightning; the latter is slow
in motion, deficient in activity, and, possessing great strength
like the elephant, it aleo partakes of the sluggish qualities of
that huge animal.
A country may be too populous, in the progress of time, the
HMfensof fireiilieod toesotire less than the demand for necessary
subsiste ce The starving operatives, whose haggard faces and
decrepit limbs are seen m the manufacturing towns of Europe,
and the squalid beings who haunt the crowded marts of com
meice, attest the misery of a redundant and confined popula
tiuu If would be sin and folly to bung into existence such a
state of society, no political expediency, no piospect of national
giandeur, could justify the =acnnce of individual welfare, and
the duty of Government is to provide for the comfort of all the
people, and to nuke them satisfied with their condition by
ministering to the wants and necessities of their nature But
we are still very far from the point of pauperism, every where
m this favoied land mdustiy meets with its due reward, and
competency is in the reach of all, except the vicuna and unfor
túnate If the old world be a cuteiion on this subject, the
twenty six States of the Union can suppoit a population mora
than four times as great as that which they now contain, and
the true question is, whether the future inciease of the people
should be kept within our present limits, or stimulated to wan
dei over the vast regions ol the West
If happiness depended entirely on the number of hogs i aised,
oi the quantity of torn gathered, then the citizens should be
dispeiseil, so as to oceupy the most feitile spots in our whole
teintory but, regarding only physical comfott, we shall hnd
that the luxuuei of Hie die not always at the command of
those who have many abroad acre m poase&sion, The pr«
ductioii3 of foreign climates have become almost indispensa
ble neces^aiies The offspring:  of the ocean constitute a gieat
souice of sensual emoymei t, and articles of manutauuie un
known to our fdthers are now famittai in household economy
—all these lie not easily ob'amed by the emigrant, and though
he has anadie gianaues, yet the «-urn of comfort is less than if
he had remained m his old habitation To take a higher view
of the subject, the bocial advantages of a compact papulation
preponderate greatly over the coaiser benefits of sprinkled set
tlements The development of the human mind, which con
tubutes in so uxtiaoidinary a degree to the iiapp.ness of our
íace occurs only in dense communities, the gieat inventions m
the aits have been made when there was a supeiabundance of
labor, and the wonderful discoveries of science, which have
displayed the laws of the material world to human vision, have
been caused by the necessity of men's turning their attention to
othei pursu'tii than those of meie physical exertion Need I
dwell on the humanizing influence of literature; and the grace
ful refinements of art* These are not confined to the nchand
the great, but are felt in the humble dwellings of the poor, they
soften the manneis, widen the circle of innocent enjoyments,
and elevate and strengthen the character If man be more
than an animal, if he qua'mes of the intellect were bestowed
on lum foi cultivation, it is proper that they should not be
choked by the re ugh tares of meie sensual pleasure
The people of the old world look on a few acres of inhen
tance with pious regard The ownei is. warmed at the same
hearth which gave comfort to his ancestors, and he enjoys the
shade of the oíd trees planted by their care every thing aiound
connects him with the past, keeps fresh m memory the deeds
arid vntues of departed geneiations, and cherishes the most
hallowed feelings of the heart The sa ne dwelling is to be the
abode of his oWn children, and another tie thus links him to
the spot, thinking oí the past, and looking to the future, feeling
that the spirus of the dead are watching over their earthly heme,
and that the hopee oí the living are dependent on his eonduct,
he is asli -tmed to disgrace hi  fathers and to blast the character of
his posterity, and thus has a doub o incentive to houest and
^eneious actions How different aie the circumstances of our
own country1 The policy oí the Go\emment, m constantly
expOfcing to sale new tracts of land, has lessened the value o!
our soil, and destioyed those sacred ties which should bind us
to our eatly homes If a man coold make fifty dolíais by the
contiact, lie would sell his paternal acres with the bones oí
his ancebtors, one place is as dear to him as another, and he
feels but little regret in leaving forever the scenes of his child-
hood, and banishing from the mind their sweet associations
The moral chaiaeter of our people is also affected The faci-
lity with which persons can emigrate removes from society a
check on vice and crime, the fraudulent debtoi, the house
breakei, and the assa^m, not only escape the consequences of
guilt, but, with a little impudence and energy, they acquire
fium the Government valuable poasessions Tt maybe apked,
should men be forced to cultivate a poor soil, when the rich
valleys of the West can be reached1 We must not forget
that the lands of the old States were once ieitde, in their
vngm condition they produced most bountifully, and with pro
per care would, to this day, have sustained m comfort a mime
rous population But where land is gives away by the Go
vemment, the agueulturist is ciuel and mereenaiy, he taxes
its poweis to the utmost extent without íeparation, and, hav
ing diunk its hie blood, he removes to more inviting spots, to
piactise the same unprofitable husbandry The Arab of the
desert pitches his tent where he finds green, herbage and a
spring and, having exhausted these blessings, he flies m search
of others, so our citizens seem to have no tiome, no local at
tachments, butgo where they tan get the most for the present
time The consequence is, we have a miserable system of
agriculture, and the most profuse habits of any people on the
globe It is almost useless to improve the land, oi to ornament
it with elegant and substantial buildings, so probable it is that
the next generation will leave it to deeay The soil which is
now considered the best, will m it« turn be worn out, and the
tide ofemigranon will flow to newer regions Where, then, is
the wisdom oí a policy which impoverishes one section of the
country, and keeps our people m constant motion1 I have en-
deavored to show that it promotes neither the strength of the
nation nor the happiness of individuals, that it retards mtellec
tual advancement and banishes some of the finer feelings of
the heai t, and if meie temporary convenience be overlooked,
and the permanent welfare of the country alone be considered,
moie evil than good will be found attendant on the present sys
tern The public lands should have been brought into market
gradually, and according to the wants of an increasing popula
tion Had this been done, the old Spates would now have been
m the highest condition, the wealth and improvement diffused
over a large surface would have been concentrated, and mag
mficent results would have followed The people in this ex
tensive counti y would have been made homogeneous, the sur-
plus of northern enterprise and industry would have flowed to
the South, our Institutions would have been strengthened, and
more correct principles and feelings would have existed
But whatever may be the effect of this land policy on the ge-
neral welfare, it has been deeply injurious to the Southern por
tion of the Confederacy An early traveller into "North Caroh
na speaks with wonder of its fertility, and the Various fruits
which ar*> spontaneously yielded by the earth Now the «oil is
woi n out, the people are gone, and this young and lovely lasd
is almost in a state of desolation The same remark Is appii.
cable to the whole South, the commerce and manufactures of
the Northern States, and accessions to their population frem
Europe, have Baved them fiom this exhausting procees If s\t
the people born in North Carolina had remained m its bums,
our swamps and low grounds would have rivalled the valley oí
the Nile in production, and our pine barrens would have uecn
flourishing with the vine, the olive, and the mulberry. Wc
have, therefore, reason to complain of the policy of this Go-
vernment Let not gentlemen apeak of the nation Those who
are cor «nually prating about the good of the whole, and pre-
tend to know no difference between Massachusetts and Virginia,
always manage to consider their own interests the general wel-
fare I, sir, was not sent heie to legislate for all mankind;
those whom I repi esent are nearest to my hear% and that land,
which gave me birth, and has early honored me, i  the first it>
my consideration Others may act as it pleases them, but I
will never sustain a policy so detrimental to the people with
whom I am connected.
If these íemarks be unavailing, the patriot should fear for Ihe
peimanence of the Republic, when he thinks of the enormous
extent ef its tennory Already have the jarring interests of
the different parts created violent contests on thisfloor, and dt.
semmated through the country the seeds of ill feeling and of
future stn e New England contends for the protection ot its
industry, and the South demands free trade on the ground off
policy and justice The West talks of seizing the public do
main, and the East denounces the act ab plunder and villany
The represéntate es of the nation assemble here to provide for
the general weliaie, but no measure is brought forward, no
question is discussed, no law is passed, which affects aü por-
tions equally, and which is not supported and opposed accord
ing to its bearing on sectional interests Do gentlemen wish
to increase these difficulties? Let us not deceive ourselves with
the notion that the charm of our Revolutionary struggles will
lastiorever, the glories of Bunker  Hill, of Yorktown,and of
King's Mountain, are the property of the nation, and will be-
dear to the latest protterity, but these alone cannot keep i>s
together, they may satisfy emhus sm, but will not actuate
statesmen We must have the same feelings and the samem
teresta, above all, this Government should abstain irom inter-
fering with local affairs, either for good or evil
The great object of a American patriot should be to strength
en our institutions Premature growth in the human body,
though it excites the wonder of all beholders, is too often the
cause of eaily dissolution, the stature and the Umbs exceed the
strength, and the bright promise of youth is blasted, while those
who gradually ascend from the weakness of childhood ft ill
surely attain a sound and healthful maturity This political
fabric reared by our fathers is fair to the sight, and we indulge
the hope, that it will bear the storms of time, and give prutec
tion to future generations, but there is reason to fear that these
constantadditions will injure the whole stiucture, and this glo
nous work of the Revolution tumble into rums, from inability
to sustain us own weight
A few days ago, when the bi'l for the removal of the Chero
kees was undei discussion, we heaid the most pathetic lamen
tatioss over the condition of the poor Indian The hoarse croak
mgs of fanaticism, and the dove ike accents of philanthropy,
were joined in the solemn chorus, and one would have thought
that these gentlemen were anxious to surrender the possessions
acquired by the cunning of their pious ancestors Sir, I voted
for that bill, and I felt indignant at the attempt to set aside a
tieaty sanctionedby all the au thou ties of this Government, but
now I wiil join these benevolent gentlemen—I will co operate
with the m doing justne to the savage, and in healing the
wounds inflicted by our fathers I understandthat all these In
dian treaties are tainted with fraud, or the poor natives arc
forced into compliance with the wishes oi our people, let us,
therefore, strike at the root of the evil, let us, henceforth, ab-
stain fiom the purchase of Indian territory, let us keep our ci
iizens from encroaching on then possessions, and we shall have
no more wars, no more "expenditure of blood and treasure" on
the frontier What says the gentleman from Vermont, [Mr
Emsrbtt,] who ha? signalized himself in behalf of the Chero
kees? Will he accede to this^ioposition? Is he willing to let
the Indians retain the remnant of their property, and to confine
the white man m his present borders? Sn, those who groan
most piteously over Ross and his associates are eager enough
to drive or cajole thesavags of the Northwest, and the gentle-
man himself (Mr Everett] has otTered an amendment to this
bill, appropriating ten thousand dollars to the laudable pur
pose of making treaties with the Indians, that is, of cheating
them out ei their lands I iear that this modern philanthropy,
like the fluid of the thermometei, rises as it approaches die
South The new code of morals recognises a difference be-
tween Northern and Southern Indians, and some gentleman
may think it politic and sagacious to lay the corner stone of a
fnendly nation m the heart of the Southern country. We shall
remember their kindness
it becomes a great people to be just and generous Our
fithers found this continent in the possession of a noble raee of
freemen and warriors, by a policy, which I need not designate,
the natives has e melted away from the face of the earth, and
to tlv white man beieng the seats of then council fires, and the
graves of their ancestors Without any sacrifice but that of
avarice and ambition, we might new repair the wrongs which
two centuries have been accumulating, by collecting the rem
nants of this ill fated people, and guarantying te them the
country not yet admitted into the Union, by sincerely offering
the hand of fnendship, ana making them acquainted with the
blessings of Christian civilization, we might bring into exis
tence a great empire to check the insolence of too much pros-
perity, end we sheuld certainly shed on oar country immortal
honor by this act ol national justice
The honorable gentleman from South Carolina [Mr Thomp
son] opposes the bill, because its tendency is to increase the
stiength of the non siaveholdmg fetates, which aie already pre
ponderant in the Confederacy I regretthe introduction of this
topic, not that I differ from my honorable friend, forfaia sent!
ments bore the impiess of truth, but the objeeuons to the mea
sure are so many and powerful, that it is needless to resort to
one of an irritating nature If we oppose the bill on sectional
giounds, our enemies will support it for the same reason, ard
us passage wiil be quick and certainties we are already in a
minority I have, therefore, coufined myself to general con
sideraiions I have end* avored to discuss thesubject in rela-
tion to us bearings on the whole country, and I hope that tht*«
who have to decide the question will view it in the «am* epitit
of enlarged pstxfatism.
