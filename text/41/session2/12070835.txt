IN SENATE.
Friday, January 28, 1870.
Prayer by the Chaplain, Rev. J. P. New-
man, D. D.
The Journal of yesterday was read and
approved.
senator from virginia.
Mr. WILLEY. Mr. President, Mr._ John-
ston, Senator-elect from the State of Virginia,
whose credentials I believe were read yester-
day, is on the floor and desires to qualify. It
is proper for me to state that Judge Johnston's
political disabilities, if he ever was subject to
any, were removed by the act of 20th of July,
18G8.
Mr. EDMUNDS. Mr. President, I would
ask my friend from West Virginia whether
there is any mistake or other imperfection in
the act which is supposed to remove the dis-
abilities of this gentleman ? I have seen a let-
ter from Virginia, sentherealongtimeago, not
connected with the admission of the State, I
will add, which said that the disabilities of this
gentleman had not been removed. On looking
at the statute I find that the disabilities of a
Mr. Johnson, of Washington county, Virginia,
who probably was intended to be this same
gentleman, have been removed. The question,
therefore, is whether there is such a close sim-
ilarity in these two names as to justify us in
admitting this gentleman as the proper object
of that statute. I simply make the suggestion
in order that my friend from West Virginia
may have it before him.
Mr. WILLEY. If the Senator will turn to
the actof July 20,1808, Statutes-at-Large, vol-
ume fifteen, page 389, he will find the name
of John W! Johnson, of Washington county,
among others. That is the identical gentleman
whose credentials were read here yesterdayâ€”
John Warfield Johnston. There is no mistake
about it whatever.
The VICE PRESIDENT. If there be no
objection, the oaths of office will bo adminis-
tered. If there is objection, the question will
be submitted to the Senate.
Mr. SUMNER. I simply wish to understand
the fact. What is the fact ?
Mr. TRUMBULL. The Senatorfrom West
Virginia has stated it. The fact is that the dis-
abilities of John W. Johnson, of Washington
county, Virginia, who the Senator from West
Virginia has just stated is the identical person
now here, were removed by the act approved
July 20, 1868. I have the statutes before me.
Mr. SUMNER. If that is so, I am at a loss
to see any question.
Mr. EDMUNDS. The only question is that
it is a different name, but intended for the same
man.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Chair hears
no objection. The Senator-elect for the term
ending March 3, 1871, will present himself
at the chair of the Vice President and take the,
oaths of office.
Mr. Johnston advanced to the Vice Presi-
dent's desk, escorted by Mr. Willey, and the
oaths prescribed by law having been adminis-
tered to him, he took his scat in the Senate.

The VICE PRESIDENT. The Chair, in
