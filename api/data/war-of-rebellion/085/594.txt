of his district ought now to be called out. I had understood from your dispatches you had so instructed General Deitzler that he held the matter ready. Price is reported as moving west from Franklin. An engagement was anticipated at Jefferson City yesterday. As all the forces moving against Price tend to drive him this way, we better be prepared to give him the warmest attentions we can, if he comes. In addition to the militia of the border counties below, I think that of Wyandotte better be called out. I will defer further suggestions till I get further intelligence. Cooper, with 5,000 or 6,000 rebels, is at Honey Springs, below the Arkansas, and I think that the nearest enemy in that direction. The troops in General Steele's department on the Arkansas ought to take care of Cooper, but those troops have need of horses and provisions, and we may have to help them. I will send this by an orderly, as it is unusually long. I will keep you advised. The eastern lines all seem closed to-day beyond Saint Joseph.

I am, Governor, very respectfully, yours,

S. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.

LAWRENCE, October 3, 1864.

Governor THOMAS CARNEY,

Leavenworth:

The militia in Miami and Johnson Counties do not understand why I have directed them to assemble. It was done under the former understanding with you. Is there any hitch in the matter? If so, please correct it and have them gotten out at once.

GEO. SYKES,

Major-General, Commanding.

LAWRENCE, October 3, 1864.

Colonel G. A. COLTON, Paola:

Governor Carney wrote me that the militia of the border tier of counties were ordered out and that General Fishback would be instructed accordingly. They are now wanted. They have not been heretofore, and I hope they will not neglect the call.

GEO. SYKES,

Major-General, Commanding.

LAWRENCE, KANS., October 3, 1864.

Major C. S. CHARLOT,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Fort Leavenworth:

I shall send all the militia that can be gathered to Olathe. I have little faith in their turning out at this season. No estimate can be made of their number, as it depends on how many answer the call. I expect 2,000 will more than cover all that can be assembled. Provisions and some camp equipage must be sent to the assistant quartermaster at Olathe, and subsistence (three or four days') ought to be sent here for those that rendezvous here before marching toward the border. No militia has been in service yet except in Linn and Bourbon Counties. To-day orders have gone to assemble them in Miami, Johnson, Douglas, and Shawnee Counties. Some ammunition ought to be sent to Olathe (old muskets).

GEO. SYKES,

Major-General, Commanding.
