NASHVILLE, November 19, 1864.

Captain WOODWARD:

(Care General Rosecrans.)

I am informed by Major Brackett, of the Cavalry Bureau, that you contemplate ordering the men of Grierson's division now at Saint Louis to Memphis. If General Grierson has given you any such orders as this it is a violation of instructions from General Thomas, and if you take any steps toward obeying it you will be dismissed from the service in all probability. You will order all detachments of Grierson's division coming to Saint Louis to be remounted; as fast as full regiments are assembled will send them to this place via Cumberland River. Send a copy of the letter given you by General Wilson for General Grierson. Where is General Grierson? Answer.

By order of Brevet Major-General Wilson:

E. B. BEAUMONT,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.

Captain GRAHAM,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Scout returned; he left Dresden this morning. Reports Forrest crossing the Tennessee River at Perryville, to join Hood's left wing a Bainbridge; the impression is that he will make a raid on Nashville. Hood's headquarters are at Athens, Ala. Lyon remains at Paris, Tenn., with 800 men and three guns, to hold the country and obtain supplies. Parker, who lived at or near Metropolis, Ill., passed Etheridge, in Weakley County, Tenn., with arms, ammunition, and accouterments, also whisky; they were destined for Gay's company.

Respectfully,

JAMES N. McARTHUR,

Colonel, Commanding.
