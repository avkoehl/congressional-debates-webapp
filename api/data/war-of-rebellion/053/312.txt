South 10 degrees west see a small work low down on Lookout Mountain; see it indistinctly; think there are two embrasures. South 5 degrees east, probably 1000 horses grazing, beyond Rossville road, some 5 miles distant. From south 5 degrees east to south 10 degrees east, smoke, heaviest at the extremities. South 15 degrees east small smoke beyond Rossville on this side Mission Ridge and at its base. South 25 degrees east smoke to south 30 degrees east, thin except at the extremities. South 30 degrees east first tents seen on the right, few only and seen indistinctly, near an old house. South 35 degrees east smoke; some tents visible through the trees, and extending northward at foot of Mission Ridge. South 45 degrees east most smoke extending northward along the valley this side of ridge where most tents are seen. East 35 degrees south flag in same position; said to be Polk's corps flag. East 30 degrees south one regiment drilling. Aside from this nothing unusual.
