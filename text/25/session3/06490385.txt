25th Cong....3d Sess.
Public Defaulters—Mr. Wise.
Ho. of Rdps.
on whom tos'lut and goige their party vengeance,
on v. horn to vent then holy hatred of corruption,
and through wnoui they might gam public confi-
dence bv making an example of one offender,
which would at once blast the chaiactci of the
pin Admin sttatioii,and embhzon then own lm-
macul te put ity and «elf ii¿littousneis They
suc-feded riu n fiivtind Kst victim was Tobi-
ns Wultma they seized upon him and his effects,
mciicerated him neaily four yeais for a defalca-
tion of less than ^4,000, piostiated the power and
the party winch ti usted him with place, and in-
gratiated themselves m the favor of the nation as
puie patuots and honest men who would reform
and rettench all abuses, and who weie them-
selves incapable of like transgiessions
They were vigilant and faithful, energetic and
efficient, untiring and íelentless, they swept like
new broom's, they swept clean as long as any of
the dirt of the Adams administration was left in
any of the Depaitments They, in this time,
exposed all the enormities of their predecessois,
and began to foim achaiactei for themselves It
was, thought that they—they who had been such
scourges to all offenders against the punty of the
Government, would hardly be suspected of like
offenses themselves But mark you, sir,as soon
as the immaculate administration of Generaljack-
son had been long enough in power to conceive
iniquity and bring forth corruption and dime,
woise—tenfold blackei than had ever before been
peipetrated, ail at once we witness an entire
change, and hear from " the paity" a different
tone The cry of corruption was now heaid from
anothei quaitei, the tiumpet-blast came loud and
iong fiom a different point of the field The Post
Office Depaitment was first chaiged with every
dime in the calendu of malversation and mal-
feasance in office The charges were denied,
those who mede them vilified, and investigation
was scorned and scoffed at, until the complaint
became too populai to be unheeded longer A
committee was at last gi anted by both Houses
of Congiess, then investigations could not be
stifled, and their íeports from both sides, in both
branches of Congress, exposed moie bribery and
conuption, more flagrant violations of official
duty and crying abuses of official power and
tiusts, than had ever been charged or di earned
to exist The Administration made a nanow
«scape, they ían the gauntlet through this expo-
sure, and they weie by it taught a lesson which
they have ever since remembered—not foolishly
again to giant o> yield so anothei investigation To
appease the public indignation, Mr Barry, the
only honest man among that den of thieves, was
given over to the tender mercies of—what' A
foreign mission ' O B Brown was permitted
to resign with eclat and the gains he had laid up
against a day of trouble from the profits of fa-
voied mail contractors, and the rest and woist of
the robbers weie retained in their places
But, su, I was not for permuting the Admin-
istration to be "ulnpped and cleaied" after convic-
tion upon mdictmentagainst one Department, the
Post Office alone I believed that theie were other
Departments as foul, and that investigation was
more necessary m the Treasury Department, es-
pecially, than any other I so chaiged during the
iong session of 1835-36 I was laughed at as a
madman The Grlohe denounced me as the tool
of a faction, and daily were I and myfuend [Mi
Peyton] placaided for calumny and falsehood,
"by autliontii," in the official oigan During that
session, whilst theie was time to investigate, we
were not heeded, except by bitter denunciation
for false clamors But our clamois brought forth
fi uit at the next session—an official notice, though
indirect, in the message of the President—the
" last annual message" of the greatest and best
In December, 1836, General Jackson sent to us
his " last annual message," in which he gave a
cert'ficate of honesty, probity, and good demeanor
to all the officers of all the Executive Depai tments
It was given, no doubt, expiessly to falsify the
charges which had been intimated by myself and
others at the previous session respecting the then
connection between the Treasury and Reuben M
Whitney     He held to Congiess this language
" Befor" concluding this paper, I think it due to the va
nous Executive Department  to bear testimony to their
prosperous condition, and to the ability and integrity with
which they hav( been conducted It has, been m\ aim to
I enforce in ill of them i vimlant and faithful dischirge of
the public business, audit is «latifying to me to believe tint
there is no jn t ciuse of complaint, from mv quarter at the
manner in winch they have fulfilled the object  of their
creation "
And, sir, as if to give this certificate all possi-
ble solemnityof asseveration, it was made immc
diatelyto piecede that closingpaiagraph in which
as with a sigh of i egret heaved fiom the bosom
of the old Csesar at the thought of leaving power,
he pouis out his giatitude to his fellow-citizens
for their encouragement and support—expresses
his consciousness of having come short of all he
desued to accomplish, his confidence in a favor-
able construction of his motives, his consolation
that his eirois would find a coireclive m the intel-
ligence and patriotism oí those who would succeed
him, his inspiration of increased confidence in our
institutions, and his pledge, if spared by age and
infirm health in retirement, so much desired by
him, to invoke that beneficent Being to whose
piovidcnce we weie already so signally indebted,
l for the continuance of His blessings on his beloved
country
We will soon see whether there were euors to
be coirected, and time has developed whethei
" intelligence and patriotism, sufficient in those
who succeeded him, have been found to apply the
* coneclne ' "
Su, I forthwith joined issue with the proposi-
tions of this certificate I reviewed this "last
annual message" in a speech, to which I now re-
fei, as part of the "íesgesta" of this subject I
denied the proposition—
1 That the various Executive Departments
weie in a piospeious condition
2. That they had been conducted with ability
and integrity
3    That it hod been the aim of the Executive
to enfoice in all of them a Mgilant and faithful
dischaige of the public business
4    That then, was no just cause of complaint
from any quiifi at the mannei in which they
had fulfilled the objects of their cieation
I chaiged the vciy leveiseof these propositions
upon the puie, virgin administration of him who
could dono wrong, and declaied it was more cor
lupt than that which had, on the plea of conup-
tion, been thrust out of power I pledged the
proof, and demanded a committee It was not
until within one month and twelve days of the 4th
of Maich, 1837, of the expnation of the Twenty-
Tourth Congress, that I was able to wimg fiom
a reluctant Executive majouty the appointment
of a committee of investigation It would nevei
have been granted had not an issue been tendered
by the Piesident himself
And here, sit, before I proceed in the regular
chronology of my history of investigation, I must
pause to diaw your attention to the message of
Piesident Van Burcn, of December 10, 1838,
transmitting Mi Secretary Woodbury's repoitof
Decembei 6, 1838, "in i elation to the rectntiy
discovfeed default of Samuel Swartwout," dc
Such is the new title of this old work ' The fact
disclosed m this repoit, to which I wish to call
youi attention, is, that the deficit of Mi bwart-1
wout at the end of each successive yeai was as i
follows                                                                         I

Thus is it now officially reported by Mi  Wood-
bury m 1838, who was himself Mr  Secretary at
the head of the Treasury Department, in Decern
bei, 1836, when the ceitificate was given, that I
then, at the very date of the presidential certificate
of honesty and pi obity, ability and integrity, Mr  |
Swartwout's deficit was $336,718 69'    So much |
for the "integrity" of the chief ofiicer of the
custom house at New Yoik     While I was de-
nounced for insinuating even a breath of suspicion
that any one of the President's pets wis impure,
heie was the officei in íeceipt of custons at the
very flood gate of duties—the veiy emponum of
commeice, embezzling public money to the tune
of $336,000' And was he alone a defaulter  Was I
it at the receipt of customs alone that the pub'ir
money was puilonipd' No, sir Othtt Judases
held the othei bags The itcnveis at the land
offices, too, were,"at the same date, equally in
default, morally, and m a pecuniary point oí view.
There were tens and/tffies of cases even woise in
moial tuipitude, though less in amount of dolíais
and cents, than the case of Swartwout as I will
show dnectly by House document No 297, dated
Mai ch 30,1838, containing the official < onespond-
ence of Mr Woodbuiy with receiveis, and the
reports of commissioners upon the " condition,"
of their offices, a document which shows default-
ing receiveis were as numerous as land offices
themselves I did not know of these cases then;
no one had heard a whispei of the defalcations of
asmgleoneof the long list which is now reported-
All was then kept quietly and snugly concealed
in the dark chamber of Mi Woodbuiy's seciet
cabinet I did not know, but, m Yankee phrase,
I "guesied" a. giesX deal, though not half of what
is since told
To return to my history I challenged the
opportunity of inquiry and investigation, and not
until the 17th day of Januaiy, 1837, the session
necessarily to expire on the 4th of Maich, it was
granted—giudgmgly, delusively, hypocritically,
it is tiue, but it was granted
Now, let us see what then weie the doctrines
and practices of the administration, of the Presi-
dent, of the heads of Depaitments, of the Speaker
of this House, of the committee appointed by
him, of the House itself, and the whole paity,
touching the rights and poweis and duties of in-
vestigating the official abuses and conuption in
the Government?
Sir, the whole party, fiom the President down
to you,sir, resorted to every device to evade, and
finally defied and denounced, al! inquiry and all
investigation You all attempted to bell the cat'
You warned the rats You hid them Aftei os-
tensibly giving full scope in the resolution of in-
quiry, to gull the people with fair pietensions,
you shut the doois of the Depaitments, you si-
lenced all resolutions and mteirogatones in the
committee rooms'
On the 17th dry of January, 1837, the House
of Representatives passed the following resolu-
tion
" Rcsohcd, That so much of the President'-* message is
relates to the 'condition of the vanou  Lxecutive Depart
ments, the ability and integrity with which they have been
conducted, the vigilant and f mliful disch ug( ul the public
business m ill of them ind the causes of comphim from
any quarter, it the mannei hi winch they hive fulfilled the
objects of their creation,' be referred to a select committee
of nine members, with power to f-end for per&ons and pa
pers and with instructions to inqmr< into tin condition of
the vinous Executive Departments, tin ilnlm and integrity
with which they hive betn conducted, into the mil ner in
which the pubhe business has been disehargi d in ill of
thf m, and into Ul causes of compllmt, from my quarter,
at the manner in which said Department , or thí ir hut cms
>r offices or any of their officersor agentsof even descnp
tion whatever dinelly or indirectly connected with them
m any mlnnei, officially or unofficially in duties pertaining
to the public niierest, have fulfill!d or f11 dt  iccornph li
the objects f their ereition or have violate ¡ tlnir duties,
or h ive mpiri d and impaired the public serviu and inter
est ind that said committee m its inquiries may refer to
mu h pe lods of lime as to them may seem expedient and
propt r "
The committee appointed by you, sir, wascon-
stituted thus Mi WtsF, Mr Pearce of Rhode
Island, Mi Muhlenberg, Mr CAiurBFii,Mr
HAi,vicui,Mr Parks,Mr L.iNC0LN,Mi Mam?
of New Yoik, and Mr Chínet
Six good liege men, and true, to three m favor
of investigation' Thus constituted, stocked, the
committee went to woik procteded uith its task
until the 3d day of Mai ch, 1837, and on that day
made three repoits,as was to have been expected
One icport was signed by the majouty of six, the
other by the minotity of thiee, and 1 made a sep-
arate repoit, in which Messis Lincoln and
Campbeii did not orconld rot unite, for want of
time to examine it in detail If 1 am wrong in
assigning this reason foi not having his signatuie
with mine, the gentleman, [Mr Lincoln,] now
present, will correct the statement
Mi  LIN COLN here nodded assent to its truth
Mr WIfeL This repoit at large, wutten and
composed whol'y by myself, I beg leave to read
in part, as the best commentnj 1 now can make
upon the history and proceedings of that commit*
