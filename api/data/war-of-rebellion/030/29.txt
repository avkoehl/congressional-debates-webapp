Major-General McCook, Nashville:

Send all your available railroad force to work on bridges from Nashville to tunnel. If you have not mechanics, the men can cut timber and square it. Timbers are supposed to be ready for Dry Creek Bridge; you can ascertain from Mr. Goodhue. Mr. Anderson goes out to tunnel in the morning. Crowd it through. If Crittenden has railroad men, have them go to work in force.

By order of General Rosecrans:
