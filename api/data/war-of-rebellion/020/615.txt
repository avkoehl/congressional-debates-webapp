a fleet of steamers from passing the works defending the entrance of this harbor, it becomes as urgent as it is indispensable to increase the heavy armament of the works intended to command the anchorage in the harbor and the entrances into the Ashley and Cooper Rivers to the utmost possible extent; hence I have the honor to request that I may be furnished as soon as practicable, in addition to calls for ordnance already made on the Department, with twenty 10-inch columbiads, five banded rifled 42-pounders, and five banded rifled 32-pounders, or fifteen of the first quality, ten of the second, and five or more of the third. A greater number of each quality could be advantageously located if they could be obtained.

I shall submit within a day or two, for the information of the War Department, a detailed report showing the exact defensive condition of this harbor at present and the extreme necessity of the additional heavy ordnance now called for.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. T. BEAUREGARD,

General, Commanding.
