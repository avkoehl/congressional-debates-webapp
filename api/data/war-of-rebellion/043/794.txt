to retire mu whole command to save it from being destroyed by our own artillery. We continued thus advancing and fighting until about 10. 30 a. m., when, the rebels having been driven by our fire and shells from the stone wall and breastworks in our front, my regiment steadily advanced in line, and occupied both the wall and breastworks under a continuous fire from sharpshooters in tree-tops, whom we had been unable thus far to silence. Immediately on gaining the breastworks, my regiment was relieved by the One hundred and twenty-third Regiment New York Volunteers. We proceeded forthwith to the ammunition train, replenished, and, under orders, returned to the support of the One hundred and twenty-third Regiment New York Volunteers, then in the breastworks, where we remained under a most terrific shelling from rebel batteries until nearly 5 p. m. The regiment with the remainder of the First Brigade was then moved across the Gettysburg road to support the center in an attack then being made with great determination on the part of the enemy. Before we were placed in position the enemy were repulsed, and my regiment once more returned to our breastworks, and remained in line during the night of the 3rd and all day and night of the 4th instant. On the 4th, a detail was furnished as a burial party, and also another detail to collect arms and accouterments left by the enemy on the field between the breastworks and the wall and in our immediate front. On the 5 th, the burial party still continued its services, commanded by Captain W. W. Smith, of my regiment, until 1 p. m., when all the dead in the immediate front of the First Division were buried. On the afternoon of the 5th instant, we moved from the battleground and marched to Littlestown, Pa. I lost of enlisted men 5 killed and 23 wounded. Our position on that day was one calculated to put to the severest the courage of both officers and men. For nearly six hours in the morning my regiment was constantly engaged with the enemy, and did most effective service in driving them from the position they then held, thereby regaining our breastworks. With the exception of one officer-no longer belonging to my regiment-and some half dozen men, whom I have reason to believe became more seriously indisposed the nearer they approached danger, all in my command conducted themselves with true courage and devotion to duty; and while some of my officers, from the position in which they were placed, fought more valiantly than others, yet, where all did so well their duty, it might give rise to unjust inferences to particularize. Each officer and man then with me seemed intent only on doing his whole duty, cheerfully and promptly executing every order. With the movements of the Twelfth Corps in its many weary marches and advances upon the enemy, the laborious construction of breastworks at Williamsport, and the unceasing vigilance necessarily imposed, from the battle-field at Gettysburg until our arrival at this camp, my regiment bore its part well, rendering no special services worthy of note here. *

I have the honor to be, your very obedient servant,

WM. B. WOOSTER,

Lieutenant Colonel 20th Regiment Connecticut Vols., Comdg. Regiment

A. L. McDOUGALL,

Colonel 123 Regiment N. Y. Vols., Comdg. 1st Brig., 1st Div.
