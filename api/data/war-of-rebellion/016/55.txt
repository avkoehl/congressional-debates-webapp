Numbers 11. HDQRS. THIRD ARMY CORPS, ARMY OF VIRGINIA, Culpeper Court-House, August 9, 1862.

Major-General POPE:

GENERAL: I have just received a letter from the colonel of the Rhode Island cavalry, who says:

All is quiet in front of us. The enemy is always before my vedettes. On my left there is perhaps a regiment of rebel infantry. In a word, I do not believe the enemy to be in force in our front. General Bayard has just ordered me to march to repulse the enemy.

Very respectfully, general, your obedient servant,

IRVIN McDOWELL,

Major-General, Commanding Third Army Corps, Army of Virginia.

Numbers 12. HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF VIRGINIA, SECOND CORPS, August 9, 1862-2.25.

Major-General POPE:

General Williams' division has taken position on the right of the pike, the right on a heavy body of woods. General Augur on the left, his left resting on a mountain occupied by his skirmishers. He will soon be in position. The enemy shows (which is strong) ostentatiously. No infantry seen and not much artillery. Woods on left said to be full of troops. A visit to the front does not impress that the enemy intends immediate attack; he seems, however, to be taking positions.

N. P. BANKS.

Numbers 13. HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, August 9, 1862-4.50.

Colonel RUGGLES, Chief of Staff:

About 4 o'clock shots were exchanged by the skirmishers. Artillery opened fire on both sides in a few minutes. One regiment of rebel infantry advancing now deployed in front as skirmishers. I have ordered a regiment on the right, Williams' division, to meet them, and one from the left; Augur to advance on the left and in front.

N. P. BANKS.

5 P. M.-They are now approaching each other.
