THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
July 7,
ment is, on page 16 of the bill, after line three
hundred and seventy-nine, to insert the follow-
ing clause:
To enable the Secretary of the Navy to discharge
liabilities provided for by oontracts made previous
to March 4,1869,1515,960 62.
Mr. SPENCER. I should like to inquire of
the chairman of the committee who reported
this bill what that means. I wish to ascertain
definitely what is meant by that amendment.
Mr. MORRILL, of Maine. I send to the
Chair a communication from the Secretary of
the Navy on the subject, and ask that it be
read.
The Chief Clerk read as follows:
Navy Department, March 20,1870.
Sir : When the present Administration came into
office certain claims against the Department, which
seemed to bo founded in justice, remained unpaid.
Some of these bills were of tools and steam-machin-
ery, under oontracts made during the last Admin-
istration, and some for ordnance, contracted under
similar circumstances. The Department has had
them all investigated and passed upon by boards
appointed for the purpose, and the amounts now
due ascertained.
These amount, in the aggregate, to * $580.34192 in
the steam-engineering department, and to 8106,892 34
in the ordnance department. The particular accounts
so respectively due will appear by the inclosed state-
ment. The amount of $72,060 38 is the amount foulid
to be now actually due Mr. Ames on the report of the
board appointed in his case, but the amount of $85,200
is what will bedue him in addition should he success-
fully comply with the tests prescribed by the board.
These debts, though not oontractod by the present
Administration, are believed to be justly duo to tho
parties named, who are injured by the detention of
t,he money. The Department is not now able to pay
them, as tho money formerly available for such pur-
pose had, before the present Administration came in,
been usedfor other purposes or covered into the
Trcasuiy, and to use the money appropriated for cur-
rent expenses to pay old debts would cripple both
the bureaus referred to in thenecessary curr en toler-
ations. I therefore suggest that a sufficient sum he
appropriated by Congress to pay these claims as now
ascertained, and I have written this letter in order
that these parties may not stand as claimants whose
rights are disputed by the Department, but as cred-
it.oi's whose debts are due, and would be paid if the
Department had the power to do so.
Very respectfully,
GEO. M. ROBESON,
Secretary of the Navy.
Hon. L. M. Morrill, Chairman of the Committee on
Appropriations United States Senate.
Mr. MQRRILL, of Maine. Tbatcommuni-
cation refers to the document which I will send
to the Secretary and ask to have read in con-
nection with it.

Besides the above, there will be due Horatio Ames,
if the six remaining guns withstand the proof decided
upon by the board, an additional sum of $85,200.
Mr. SPENCER. I desired to know what
that appropriation was for. Now, I desire to
call the attention of the chairman to the amend-
* Reduced by compromise and settlement with
Roach & Son to #430,760 92.
ment on page 18, in the clause reading as fol-
lows :
For repairs of machinery of steamers, boilers, in-
struments, tools, labor, transportation, materials,
stores, £1,750,000.
I should like to inquire if he knows specific-
ally that that does not embrace any old claims ?
Mr. MORRILL, of Maine. No, sir; it is
for the current year.
Mr. SPENCER. I now move to strike out
the amendment on page 16, commencing at
line one hundred and eighty, and extending
to line one hundred and eighty-four, in these
words:
To enable the Secretary of the Navy to discharge
liabilities provided for by contracts made previous
to March 4,1869, 8515,960 92.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Chair will
state to the Senator from Alabama that that
clause is not yet in the bill. The question is
on concurring in the amendment inserting it..
Mr. SPENCER. Then I move that the Sen-
ate do not concur. I do so in order to prevent
the Corliss Steam-Engine Company from re-
ceiving the sum of $257,000. I shall also move
to insert at the end of line four hundred and
ninety-two the following proviso:
Provided. That no money appropriated by this act
shall bo expended on account of naval engines con-
tracted for during the war.
The VICE PRESIDENT. That will be in
order as a subsequent amendment.
Mr. SPENCER. I wish to state to the Sen-
ate that the subject of the payment of the sum
of $257,000 to the Corliss Steam-Engine Com-
pany is now under investigation by the Com-
mittee on Retrenchment, and a sub-committee
is taking testimony, I understand, daily.
Mr. President, the Senate, upon the recom-
mendation of the Committee on Patents, re-
fused to extend the patent of George II. Corliss
for improvements in steam engines, of which
he had enjoyed a monopoly for twenty-one
years, and from which, after harassing the real
inventors with expensive law-suits, he had
realized, directly aud indirectly, a fortune of
upward of a million dollars. Notwithstanding
these enormous profits, he had the audacity to
come before Congress asking an extension of
his monopoly for seven years longer, which has
been promptly and justly refused.
Noticing in the remonstrances which crowded
the table of the Senate against the extension
of this monopoly, the statement that Mr. Cor-
liss had effected a settlement with the Navy
Department on account of a pair of incom-
pleted naval engines, in which settlement only
$30,000 had been deducted from the full con-
tract price of $730,000, notwithstanding a
board of survey had reported that it would cost
$140,000 to finish the engines, I made inquiry,
and learned that the statement in the remon-
strances was correct, and that Mr. Corliss had
in his possession a certificate of that Depart-
ment for $257,000 on account of the very
engines he was asking Congress to make an
appropriation to pay him for. Satisfying my-
self that every dollar of this quarter of a mil-
lion which Mr. Corliss was seeking to take
from the Treasury—already depleted by him
to tho amount of $800,000 for two pairs of
engines admitted to be worthless—would be a
clear profit to Mr. Corliss, upon no principle
justly due to him from the Government, and
obtained only by deception or fraud, I felt
it my duty to call attention to the subject by
offering a resolution, which passed the Senate
on the 18th day of February last, calling upon
the Secretary of the Navy for the particulars
of the settlement made with Mr. Corliss.
I did not doubt that the Secretary, upon his
attention being called to the subject, would
investigate the facts, and finding them to be
as I have stated, would promptly recall the
certificate for $257,000 held by Mr. Corliss,
revoke the pretended settlement, and refuse
to pay any sums not justly due from the Gov-
ernment. In this expectation, I am sorry to
say, I have been disappointed. The Secretary
does not make the effort that he ought to save
a quarter of a million dollars to the Govern-
ment. Although upon the passage of the res-
olution, I am informed, he called upon Mr.
Corliss to return the certificate which he held,
yet, most unaccountably, after taking this posi-
tion, he retracted it; allowed himself to be de-
ceived and prevailed upon by this wealthy ami
wily contractor to permit him to retain the
certificate, and actually, in his official capacity,
to justify the settlement, which justification is
stated in the reply of the Secretary to the Sen-
ate resolution, dated March 31, and which is
now printed and before the Senate.
This unexpected and remarkable action of
the Secretary in approving where-he should
have condemned, in expending where he should
have saved, in advocating the scheme to take
$250,000 from the Treasury, instead of pre-
venting the attempt and contending with all
his energies to protect the Government from a
swindle, (although undoubtedly procured by
the misrepresentations of the party in interest,
and who has deceived the Secretary,) makes
it necessary for me to move to strike out the
words I have indicated.
The charge was that in the settlement made
by the Navy Department with Corliss for two
pairs of naval engines, a gratuity of $110,000
was given to Corliss by the deduction, for non-
completion of the engines, of only the sum of
$30,000, instead of the sum of$140,000, recom-
mended by the board of officers appointed to
report upon the same. That charge is now
repeated, and is accurately set forth in the
following statement of the settlement:
