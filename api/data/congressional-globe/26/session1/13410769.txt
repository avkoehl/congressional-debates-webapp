26th Cons....1st Sess.
Independent Treasupy—Mr. fVhiit.
H. of Reps.
la thy blush!" Sir, my heart sickens at the contemplation—
mj soul sinks luto deep humiliation at the degradation of my
country's honor. It impairs my respect and admiration for
the forms of popular Government What else do we hear,
what else have we heard for the last ten yeirs dinning in our
ears from the dominant party, but prolessions ol unbounded
faith in the intelligence a id virtue of the people? Vox poputi,
re* dei—the voiced the people is the voice of God—has been
the burden of every State paper coming from the Elective
for the last te i years The favorite and cherished theme of
every demaguage in Congress and out of It, ol the party in
power And yet, sir if there is any credit to be placed in the
authors of the passages I have read to the committee, it is in
disputable that the people, the dear people, ihe intelligent people,
the profound people, the virtuous peop e, ihe people -whose opi-
nions and wishes should always be consulted in the adopti >n
of any ureal measure," so far from havi >g their ■ opinions" and
"wishes" consulted upon great pub ic measuies, lutolving not
■imply their prosperity, but their very existence as a free
nation, have been studiously kept (by these sell styled Demo-
crats,) in the most profound ig oranre ol what was secretly
meditated The people could not be trusted wiih the secret
They had for seven long years been kept upon the green, but de-
ceptive surface of a full charged volcano, unconscious of tbe
danger beneath, tantalized bv hollow, deceitful, ami treacherous
demagogues,blinded by flattery and deluded by specious, but
false appearan< es of permanent prosperity 1 hey, who, for
sordid and selfish purposes of avarice and ambition, have by
sy ren songs lulled them to sleep, or if they even aroused them,
it was only to write tbe sentence ot political ostracism against
the patriot who liad moral courage and public virtue sufficient
to proclaim ihe danger that awaited and threatened them
But, sir, 1 have raid Mr Van Buren and the Missouri Senator
were Castor and Pollux, twin brother*, in all this crusade upon
banks and currency, in all this perfi ly and treachery to the
State banks, in all this system ol infidelity to the pi< servauon
of the public moneys, in all this delinquency of duty to the peo
pie as their "public servants" Now, sir, I intend to proven,
every word ol it 1 me m to prove Sit, 1 know these details ol
facts are tedious pernape, they are bound t > be minute and in-
dividual in their uearmg, but it is due to the just appre  lation
of the character of these ind viduals, filling high p aces, to the
proper amount ol authority then names stiould weigh in the
Consideration and ador.u >n of this or any other great ineasme
of public policy, and. above all, it is due to the abused talth of
atoo confiding and deluded people, that the part played lor the
last ten years in the groat drama ol bank ''demolition," curren-
cy demolit'on, exchange demoliu >n, finance demolition, and
Íiublic and private property demolition, should bs freely and
aithfully spoken, written, and pubhohed to the people of this
country anil the world. If the effort should fall still born, as I
have every reason to fear it will upon the majority ol this
House, and possibly upon the people, though I pray God not,
yet 1 shall sull have the consolation of having discharged my
' duty.
Now, sir, 1 proceed to offer the testimony to establish the po-
litical twinshipof Mr. Van Buren and the Missouri Senator Í
I read from a letter, written in 1834 Alluding to, and speaking
of Mr V o Hurcn, he says; 'I have know that gentleman long
andtotimat ly,  -« itereil ihe Senate ol the United Slates to
gether thirteen y*?rj ago, sat six year  in seats next to each
other, ware always personally fríen lly, generally acted together
upon leading subjects, and always interchanged communica-
tions and reciprocal confidence " Again, the Senator I rom
Missouri, in his speech of this session upon this bill—"the ca-
tastrophe of 1837 was preparing, and I saw it as distinctly before
it happens as afterwards In the winter of 1836,1 pointed out
this catastrophe to the Presidentelect, the now President of the
United States. I invited him into the Finance Committee room
of the Senate in the winter of 1S36-7, four months before the
banks exploded, and made kn wn to him my opinion of the
coming danger, f spoke to him in his high cbaractar of Presi-
dentelect, and to warn him of the danger that was to salute his
nascent Administration. 1 should not mention this, was it not
that the President himself well remembers it, and often men-
tions k. I had no more doubt then of the coming expl >sion,
than I had after the nine hundred banks of the Union had shut
up." Shall I multiply proof* I have more at hand, but will
not atop to read, none but the sceplic, it seems to me, can
doubt, after the lacis already furnished. But 1 must claim the
attention of the committee to a brief analyzation of this para-
graph. It discloses more important lnfoimation upon another
point. Besides the twinship, it fixes, beyond the power ol es-
cape, when taken in connect.on with the speech of 1836-7,
and a sentence to be found in the inaugural of Mr Van Buren,
in these words, he sayr ' In all the attributes of a great, ha|.py,
and ttourisnmg people, we stand without a parallel in the
world; we presentan aggregate of human prosperity surely not
elsewhere to be found " Now, sir. mark the dates, for dates
sometimes are all important in scanning facts Remember that
in 1835 the people had fifty millions of doll <rs on deposite in the
Stale banks, depositaries select  d, recommended, and endorsed
as safe places of the public treasur by these distinguished
personages Tne cur ency of these banks also recommended
and endorsed to the country as sound, in ihe speech of IS36,
and in the inaugúralo) the 4th of March, 1837, four months al
ter the "private conversation in the Finance Committee room, '
in which conversation it is agreed that the State banks were
rotten, that the currency was unsound to the core; that explo-
sion, a universal explosion must come and come quickly; and
yet no public avowal to the dear people of the imminent clan-
ger of their fifty millionsof money deposited in these banks, no
public notice of the ruin, the universal ruin, that was ready to
buret upon the devo ed hea Is of those who had been worshiping
at the shrine of the golden idol, but, on the contrary, a studied
silence, disguised under the most plausible and positive assu-
rances that all was well, all sound Can any further testimony
bs asked, to establish the charge of infidelity to the Government
as guardians of the public treasure; of wilful delinquency and
treachery to the people?
Mr Chairman, betoielclose my observations on this branch
Of the subject, it is proper to review more minutely the
views and opinions of the present Chief Magistrate upon the
subject of State banks, to contrast his opinions at different peri-
ods, that the committee and country may have a standard by
which to value the worth of his present views I commence
as far back as 1829; I read from State papers. In his message
when Governor of the State of New York, he says; '-'The most
«Col. Benton's letter to Gen. Davis, of Mississippi.
"Epitomized by Holland, hit chosen biographer
important business of the session will be the question of the re-
iiewal of the chaners of ihe seveiat b inks in ihe state, thirty
one charters would rxpnemihe course of four yeais, wiha
capital ol fifteen millions " he then proceeds to say '• That to
dispense with the ba iksal og ther is an idea that seems to have
no advocate," he says 'That experience is against banks own
ed wholly by the sute, and that, 10 make stockholders liable
in tiieir individual capacity throws the stork into the hands of
irresponsible persons " He repudiates the predice of exacting
"b muses ' lor bank charters and says '-That, compaud wi h
the community, stockholders are few, and hence the legislative
measures should reler exclusively to the safety and ability of
the institutions " He then presents a brief epitome of the "sife
ty fund system," and recoimn mU its a hp ion Now, sir,
these are the recorded opinio is of our hard morn y President in
1829 We find in this message no ting about gold and silvei
being the only conmtutioi al medium, nothing about an 'ex
elusive metallic cutrency," except a denunciation of it as a
humbug, nothing ol 'monopolies, pnv lesed, irresponsible,
soulless corpoiations," nothing ol the dai ger of 'associated
wealth" to the perpetuity of our free institutions, nothing of
ihe "I'eiinq leney of morals" eigendered by excessite bank is-
sues, and wiU speculation, but, on the contrary, exclusive
State ownership of bank-, repudia ed, corporate association,
with individual stockholders, vindicated, liability of stockhold
ers in their private property denounced, the charging of "bonus-
es ' repmbited, the weakness ol stork lolders, as compared
with the power ol the community, urged as a rea«on why the
legnluion should especially iigardihe "safety and stabili y ol
the banks "
Now sir, I must acknowledge, had I not long since adopted
for my motto ' ml admiran" wnni'ei at nothins, I should
have beet struck with surprise and ainazeimnt when 1 first
read this S ate pipei Bulto mine down toa more recentdite
Inihe delebiaied lettei to my colleague S Williams written
in 1836, the present duel Magisti i e endorses an I approves all
the lecomm n latinm and e n igiesol his illustrious predecessor
upon theState banks no tlilfeience of npim m, ceifei t hanno
ny between him and the late Presidei t upon the various cur
renry movements ol his eventful adm mistral ion, no one do ibis
il I havealready giv n iheieasnn He bnasis in thatleiter ol
ihee icce->s(u I fiscal operation ol ihe Sta'e btnk?, of iheirsale-
ty as depositaries, of the promptness and facility with which
they transleired and disbur>ed the public funds free of charge
to the G ivernmeni, he speaks exulti, glv of the soundness ol
their circulation, of the c eapness of domes ic exchanges, the
increased amount of such facilities furnished to trade over and
above the United States Bank in any given period; the regula
uon and purification of the currency, and the increase of gold
and silver, proceeding from the po icy ol the Administration iu
thejudicious management of the public money as deposites in
the banks, now denounced by him as the vicious, pernicious
union,  'injuriou3to banks, cuirency, aiU Government "
Lest I may ba charged with misrepresentation, Mr Chair-
man, as every thing is disputed these times and these views ai e
so antago ueneal to Mr Van Buren's present views, I will read
fro it that letter a few paragraphs, that there may be no mis-
take upon this point, and the first extract will show you what a
prulound financier our worthy Chiel Magistrite is, as illus-
trated by experience 'No rational plan tor the regulation of
the fiscal afiairsof the countiy, can fail to succeed, if the mass
of our industrious and en'erprismg population, without regard
to local, sectional, or political distinctions, are only sincerely de-
sirous for its success " Now, sir, this letter is written in Au-
gust, 1836, a few short monthsafter the Dassageof the deposite
law A "plan lor the regulation of the fiscal affairs of theeoun-
iry"—supported, passed into a law, voted tor by overwhelming
majorities of both parties, in Imth Houses of Congress, and
signed by Piesident Jackson No candid man will say that the
"great mass of our industrious and enterprising popula ion,
without regard to local, sectional or political distinctions, were
not desirous foritssuccess " The President will not say it was
not a' rational plan." This Would be casting a deep reflection
upen tlieiutellig.nce of his own friends, it would be a denun-
ciation of the veiy measure, the lever that lifted him into fine
high station he now occupies, if the sagacity, sound judgment
and well matured opinion of his friend from Pennsylvania, [Mr.
Buchanan,] is entitled to credence. That distinguished Sena-
tor, in his able speech this session upon this very bill, speaking
upon that act, uses this strong and emphatir language. "I vei i-
Iv believe the present Chief Magistrate would never have been
elected had it not been for the passage of the deposite bill "
Now, sir, the qjestion recurs why did this "plan" fail; was it
not a "rational planl" The President will not say so, he dare
not say so The names of the ablest statesmen of this or any
other age, of all parties, stand recorded m its favor. I have
given you the reason in extenso in my remarks already deli-
vered Mr Chairm in, ihe reason is summed up in this short
sentence, it i\as not the' plan" of Mariin Van Buren, Thos H.
Benton, and the secret cabinet, composed of names that I will
not defile my toneue nor offend the ears of this committee by
mention'ne. It leftno' voluntary," no "discietionary" powers
with the Executive. It defined in terms of i igid specification,
the dunes and powers ol the Secretary of the Treasury. It in
terposed an impassable barn r between the public parse and
the Executive It did not provide by law for a union of the
purse and sword in the hands of the President, the consolidation
of all powers; despotism n its most odious shape. In fine, it
wasnotthe "Independent Treasury," which the Senator from
Missouri tells you and the country he and Mr. Van Buren have
been covertly aiming at and assiduously struggling for since
1830 Sir, with the pioofa I have furnished, can any honest
man doubt why it was this plan so suddenly failed) See the
executive weapon resorted to, instantly upon the adjournment
of Congress, the specie circular, ordeied in the leeth of every
member of the Senate, save two, the Senator from Missouri be-
ing one Tbe identical measure hid been proposed a few days
before the adjournment as a legislative measure and rejected
A weapon ot itself sufficient, as it proved to be, if wielded for
pvil, to arrest the 'success" of the "fiscal plan," the deposite
act, passed with such unanimity in Congress, and received with
such hopeandjoy by the country. Ti especie circular, a mea
sure justified under the pretence of checking the sales of the
public lands, and stopping the over issues of the banks, and sav-
ing the public treasure from loss. How hollow; how false; how
delusive It was not needed for the second purpose, as the de
posite act of al I measures was best adapted to answer that end
It could not effect the first object, as the money, immediately
upon payment to the various receivers, was placed in the most
convenient banks, ready to be loaned out the same day. Th 
operation in this respect proved by experience, and was admit-
ted in the annual message of the President, as he wds bound to
admit, however unpleasant, unsuccessful It amou iied to a

ruble prmcipl'S, unchangeable, this measure done vi dence to
the plainest one ol these pnnriples, it earned ihe money fio-n
whence it was due, and sent it to a sect on from whieh it w a
owing, "it took i from the creditor and sent i to the dtbtor, it
rev.rsed the laws of commerce and exchange Instead of
easing the exchanges, at that time much unbalanc d, bv or 'er-

meto square the balance of ttade between the South and West,
and the East and North in its practical operation, it reversed
the current of exchanses, and ruinously increased the balance
It not only had this deleterious efl ct, but it diminished fourfold
the amount of c rculating medium in the creditor stction in ad-
dition to the unnatural abstraction of the amount leceived for
sales of land The requisition being made in gold or si'ver
alone, every dollar withdrawn from the banks to meet the oulei
in ronncil. took íway the basisof four dollars of paper curren-
I cy Hut this was not all. The panic, alarm, confusion, and
' apprehension, excited upon the commun ty opentedtoan ex-
tent that defies human calculation. Some conception nay,
hswever, be formed by the ravages that ensued, the nniitigatsd
mischief that followed to the Treasury, to all classes of society,
to all sectnns of this wide spread Union
I do not intend, Mr Chairman, to be tin lerstood as sayirg all
the distress and ruin tins country has suflered proceeded alone
from this measen, or that there won! 1 have been no explosion
in the currency, tins I do not beneve, "anteredent causei,"
had been operating for years, the fatal effects of which
were bound to produce a moneyed cris's, it   ha 1 only  been
f>os poned by factitious circumstances, thwarting lie reju-
ar connection of cause and effect, but whit I mean to t&y
is this the catastrophe was hastened, aggravated, egre
giousiy aggravated, by this measure. There would have
been a partial suspension, but not universal; there would have
been no national bankruptcy, no universal, all-pervadme rin
tress, unparalleled individual insolvency, but for the adoption
of this "despotic order," so "glorious," ever "glorious" in the
estimation of Us authors, wantonly pernicious and wu ked in the
estimation of every mm who will look impartí lly at the con
dition of the country now, and contrast its condition tl en, and
lis'en to facts, and candidly attribute effects to their just and
natural causes, and give "to human passion its na ural a-^ncy
in stimulating human action " Now, «ir, to leave th.s d _'ies
sion, and return again to Mr Van Buren's Bank views From
the same famous letter, I read this paragraph "The amount
trmsferred by the deposite banks from June, 18 5, to Apnl,
1836, «as over seventeen millions of dollars, the operation has
b en without loss, failure, or expense " Again. ' In repaid to
the domestic exchanges, the amount performed, at the last ie.
turns, by thedepositc bank , exceeded thirty millions, wh ch
would be, in a year, one hundred and eighty million  It fui
ther appears these exchanges have been effected at a lowei
rate than by the Unitea States Bank" I here close the testi-
mony upon the Presi'eat's Bank opinions I will not weary
the committee witn any eommemsof mir e, indeed, no commer t
is needed, the facts are plain, intelligible, fully sustaining e\ cry
allegation 1 have made, bold and darn gas they may haveseem
ed, atfirst blush, to those who had not taken the pains, or had
the curiosity or the means of reviewing these topirs. I have
been thus minute in laying bare the political histoiy ef these
distinguished personages, not to gratify any feeling of tnvy or
malice, my bosom repudiates any such monve, not to exercise
a malignant vanity at showing up the ridiculous and multifa
nous tergiversations and inconsistencies of gre<n leading po',u
Clans, not to draw off the attention of this committee from Uio
true merits or dements of this measure, by dealing in the ar-
gumentum ad hominem, which of itself, I admit, retthcr esta
blishesthe truth or falsehood of a proposition; but my object
has been purely pa node I know that with the great ma s of
men, partícula ly intimes of high party excitei ent. autlioritv

How else could I check error, and break the spell of delusion,
fatal delusion, that has deceived and misled thou-ards a" I tens
ofthousands of confidme followers, forming their opw.ons
upon the simple authorities of others, without thin', i g for
themselves, than by holding up in broad but true relief the
political history of these men, that the people might see how of
