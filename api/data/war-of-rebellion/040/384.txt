HEADQUARTERS, May 3, 1863-6.15 p.m.

Major-General HOWARD,Commanding Eleventh Corps:

The cannonading in the direction of Fredericksburg increases. We can hear the musketry. Nothing put very little skirmishing on the left without yet. The enemy, however, has two pieces of artillery in position in the woods.

Respectfully, yours,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Chief of Staff.

MAY 3, 1863-1.35 a.m.

Major-General SEDGWICK,

I will send a guard of 100 men to the two bridges of your. Do you think they should be taken up? Will 40 cavalry be useful to you?

BUTTERFIELD,

Major-General.

CAMP NEAR FALMOUTH, VA., May 3, 1863-1.45 a.m.

Major-General SEDWICK:

Captain [Valerian] Razderachin's (aide-de-camp of General Hooker's staff) explanations will tell you how necessary it is that you should push through every obstacle in your path. The enemy will no doubt make every effort to delay and stop your force by a smaller one, that their main force may be used upon the right wing of our forces.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

DANL. BUTTERFIELD,

Major-General, Chief of Staff.
