Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

My cavalry have captured 500 prisoners, in addition to those previously reported. General Pettigrew, of the Confederate army, was killed this morning in the attack on the enemy's rear guard. His body is in our hands. A division of my cavalry crossed the river at Harper's Ferry to-day, who will pursue and harass the retreat of the enemy and give me information of his movements. General Kelley, with an infantry force, and Averell's cavalry, have reached Williamsport. Am I authorized to detain him here to watch the Potomac while I move to Berlin?

General Kelley has been ordered to cross the Potomac and act on Lee's right flank, in order to prevent raids into West Virginia. It is hoped that he may be able to do the enemy some harm there.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

The army was set in motion this morning at daylight, four corps being directed to this place and three to Harper's Ferry. The bridge at Harper's Ferry was finished yesterday over the Shenandoah, at its mouth. Will be planked by daylight to-morrow. A break in the canal at the mouth of the Monocacy delays the transfer of pontoons from Harper's Ferry to this point; but every effort is being made to repair the canal, which it is expected will be in order to-morrow.
