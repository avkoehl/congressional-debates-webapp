HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,Middlebrook, Md., September 11, 1862.

Major-General HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

I have ordered General Reynolds to report to Governor Curtin at the earliest practicable moment. He is now about 25 miles from here. He will probably not be able to start before morning.

GEO. B. McCLELLAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

ROCKVILLE, MD.,

September 11, 1862-12 noon.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

Please order Peck's division, upon its arrival, to proceed at once to Rockville, where it will find orders for its further movements.

GEO. B. McCLELLAN,

Major-General.

WASHINGTON, D. C.,

September 11, 1862. (Sent 1 p. m.)

Major-General McCLELLAN, Rockville, Md.:

Peck's division will not be here for some days.* Weber's troops will be sent forward as soon as they can get transportation. Why not order forward Porter's corps, or Sigel's? If the main force of the enemy is in your front, more troops can be spared from here.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,Camp near Rockville, Md., September 11, 1862-3.45 p. m.

(received 4.25 p. m.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

Please send forward all the troops you can spare from Washington, particularly Porter's Heinzelman's, Sigel's, and all the other old troops. Please send them to Brookville, via Leesborough, as soon as possible. General Banks reports 72,000 troops in and about Washington. If the enemy has left for Pennsylvania, I will follow him rapidly. I will move my headquarters to Middlebrook immediately.

GEO. B. McCLELLAN,

Major-General.

EXECUTIVE MANSION,

Washington City, September 11, 1862-6 p. m.

Major-General McClellan:

This is explanatory. If Porter, Heintzelman, and Sigel were sent you, it would sweep everything from the other side of the river, because the new troops have been distributed among them, as I understand.
