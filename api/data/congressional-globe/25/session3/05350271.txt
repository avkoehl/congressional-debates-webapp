Maine Boundary Question—Mr. Cushing.
Ho. of Reps.
Bntish warden, has seized timber there but nei-
thei he, noi anybody else from New Brunswick,
has ever, befoie the lite affair, undertaken to
seize men who acted foi and íepiesented the State
of Maine All sjch anests have taken place in
the Madawaska country It may be that Me
Laughlui has piotested on paper against acts of
sovereignty peifoimed by the State of Maine, as
in the cabe oittd last evening by my colleague,
[Mi Saltonstall ] But what does this amount
to ! Does it make out a case of the piactical e\
eicise of exclusive jurisdiction > Fai fiom it It
is only one side of the case To show a claim to
juiisdiction on paper, or even isolated acts of ju-
iisdiction,goes a very little way towaids proving
in behalf of Great Britain the practical fact of ex
elusive junsdiction and possession To under-
stand the whole case, we must look into the acts
of Mame and Massachusetts
Now, it is truly stated in the report of the
Committee on Poteign Affairs, that, in puisuance
of a resolve passed in 1806, Massachusetts, in
1807, granted a township on the Aroostook, near
to the mendian line which divides Maine and
New Brunswick, and in 1808, ten thousand acies
west of the fotmei, after suiveys and plans I
refer to these old giants to show that the exercise
of soveieignty on our part is no íecent thing
This, and what has been done since by one State
or the other, is stated generally by Governor
Fairfield as follows
u In replv, I have to siy tliit the territory boidering on
the Aroostook nvei ins always b en, is I regard the tuts,
lri the possession and under the jurisdiction of Missiohu
setts and Maine, that, moie thin thirty >ears ago, Mas
sachusetts surveyed and granted 1 trgt tracts of it, which
hive ever since, m some wiy, been p> sessi d by the
grantees, and those claiming under th< m , tint the rest of
it wis surveyed by, ind some of it divided between, Mis
sachusetts and Maine, soon alter the latter became an in
dependent Stile, that both States hive long been m the
habit of griming permits to cut timber Ihert with lut being
molested from any quarter, tint many peisous h ive pur
clnsed these lands ol Mime, and entered into their aetuii
occupation, and tint in various other ways, Mame has
exercised a juri-diction, which may fairly be regarded as
exclusive, over this territory "
In confnmation of all which, I have before me
the last repoit of the land agent of Massachu
setts, giving an account of the construction of a
road to the Aroostook at the joint expense of
Maine and Massachusetts, and detailing many
particulai s of the acts perfoi med by him in arrest-
ing trespassers on the disputed territory I have
also the report of the land agent of Maine, re-
ferring to the same facts, and stating the arrest
of sundiy trespassers by his order last year, and
by regitiarciiniprocessreturnableat Bangor. And
the same report contains the following conclusive
fact
" Near the mouth of the Little M idawaska, I met Cap
tain McLaughlin going up the Aroostook, with six men
Captain McLaughlin informed me that he was sent up by
the Governor to cut up the timber, and take off the teams
of the tre passer , if he could m no other way break them
up I informed him what I had done , he said he was
glad, and would most cheerfully cooperate with the laud
agents of Maine and Massachusetts in stopping the tres
passers "
Here we have McLaughlin himself offering no
claim to exclusive jurisdiction, making no com-
plaint of the acts of jurisdiction performed by
Massachusetts and Maine, but, on the contrary,
commending their acts, and pledging himself to
cheerfully cooperate with their land agents I
have also befoie me the report of a íecent geo-
logical survey of this tract of country, made by
the State of Maine, it being a limestone region,
of great value for the cultivation of wheat, and
on that account attractive to settlers These doc
uments show, moreover, that Maine was under
no obligation to give notice to Sir John Harvey
of her late movement for the arrest or expulsion
of the trespassers, and committed no breach of
courtesy or of right m omitting such notice. And
whether or no the facts amount to proof that
Maine has had the exclusive jurisdiction and pos-
session on the Aroostook—which is not the ques-
tion—they do at any rate absolutely exclude the
conclusion claimed by Great Britain
It is impossible, therefore, that the Legislature
of Massachusetts, in passing the resolves of 1836,
which complain of the surrender of the possession
of the disputed territory by the United States Gov-
ernment, as cited by the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania [Mr. Biddle] and my colleague, [Mr.
Saltovst\ll,1 could have meant to say that
Gieat Butam did in fact exeicise e\clusive pos-
session on the Aroostook They could not have
meant this, because they knew it was not so
ihey had the acts of each State befoie them to
show the contiaiy The particulai inducement
! | of the ícsolves was undoubtedly the acquitst-tntc
'¡ of the Government of the United States—a cul
U pable acquiescence, I think—m the acts of foicible
I, jurisdiction performed by the authonties of New
I Biunsvvickin the Madawtbka countiy, and the
pai ticuhr object of the resolves was to put an end
to the sepaiate wardenship of that country, as-
sumed by Gieat Bntain without formal notice to
the United States, and not resisted as it should
have been when made known incidentally to our
Government It was, indeed, a subject, the dip-
lomatic relations of which were at that time in-
volved in doubt, in consequence of the piocias-
tinations and other errors which our Government
had suffered in the management of the negotiation,
as I well know, fiom having had occasion at that
period, to address a senes of printed letteis on
the subject to the Governor of Massachusetts, as
the means of replacing the facts in the public mind,
and recalling them to general attention
Wbatevei loom foi misconception the partic-
ular phraseology of those resolves may alibid,
there can be no doubt now as to the present views
eithti of Massachusetts or Maine Theiesolves
just reported by a joint committee of the Legis
latuie of Massachusetts are in the following clear
and emphatic words
CUMMOHWEALTH OF M ASS ACIIL S ETTS, 1839
Resolves Concerning the Northeastern Boundary
Resolved, That the present state of irTurs in relation to
the northe istern boundary, is communicated to the Exec
utive of this Commonwealth by the Governor of the State
otMune furnishes i strong reison for igam asstrtmg our
rights and for reathrmina the positions heretofore assumed
by the Legisliture ol this btue a„ain<a the unwairautable
cl urns ot Great Britim, and in favor of strong and vigorous
measures by the Government ot the United fotatcs for i
speedy adjustment of the existing difficulties in such a man
ner is shall protect Massachusetts and Maine m the pos
session ol the large tract ol territory guarantied 10 them by
the treaty of peace of 1783
Resolved, That the active measures authorized by i re
solve of the Legislature of the totatf of Mame, pissed Jan
uary 2-1, 183Ü, for the prevention ol depredations upon the
lands ot Massachusetts and Mime, were required by the
exigencies of the case, ind a wise regird for the preserva
tion of their interests in those lands, and were similar in
character to measures adopted by the land agents of Mas
sachusetts ind Maine in October list, and recognized and
approved, through their agent, by the Government ot the
province of New Brunsw ck
Resolved, ri hit the claim by Great Britain to the exclu
sivf jurisdiction of the whole of the disputed terntorv as
recently asserted by the Lieutenmt Governor of New
Brunswick, and his avowal of a determination to sustain
that claim by i military force, and lnsdemil of the right of
the State of Manic to protect irom the lawless depred itione
of trespassers the 1 mds winch h ive long been m the actual
possession of Massachusetts and Maun call loudly tor the
immediate interference of the Federal Governmt nt, and
that the crisis has now arrived when the honor of the na
tion demands the adoption of decisive measures for the pro
teetion of her citizens, ind for the preservition of the lights
and interests of two of the members of our Confederacy
Resolved, That this f ommonwealth will cooperate with
the State ot Maine in all eon titutional measures for the
preservation of the interests of both States m the lands in
the disputed territory, and for the speedv adjustment of the
existing controversy
Resolved, That his Excellency the Governor be requested
to transmit a copy of these resolutions to the Executives of
the United States and of the State of Maine, and to each of
our Senators and Representatives m Congress
These resolves, and especially the second and
third, cover the whole ground of the questions
raised m this House
Neither the general right of jurisdiction, nor
the practical fact of possession being in Great
Britain, it only remains to consider whether she
has a temporary right of possession by agree-
ment of the United States This our Govern-
ment positively denies It challenges investiga-
tion of all the correspondence between the two
Governments as the conclusive means of settling
the question
Instead of putting his hand on the pretended
agreement—which he could readily do if it ex
isted—Mr Fox contents himself with protesting
against the denial of it which Mr Forsyth bad
made, and refers the point to his Government
Nay, further, he proceeds to negotiate a sort of
informal convention with Mr Forsyth for stop-
ping the thieatened movement of Sir John Har-
vey.   Certain it is that no such agreement exists
Whether the pioposals made on the one side and
I accepted on the other, or the acts 01 omissions
i' of our Government, were such as tojus'ify mis-
\[ construction on the part of Gieat Bntain, and
what is tne tine construction of those proposals,
I acts, and omissions, is a question which I will
| not presume to entei upon, aftei it has been so
I fully discussed by the gentleman from Maine,
[Mi   Evans,] obsei ving, onlj , that Gieat  But
I   am might as well misunderstand or fall into de-
lusions concerning any clause of treaty between
II  us, as this agreement that we are not to suffci
for the enois she may commit in this way, and
that the attempt on the part of Great Bntain, to
enlarge the actual agieement beyond the obvious
impoit of the words, or to set up, instead of it,
another agreement which was never made, only
tends, it seems to me, to aggravate the injury of
her whole conduct in this matter, and to give to
the United States additional cause of complaint
For there is not, nevei was, and cannot be,
any reasonable doubt as to the respective rights
of the paities, nor more especially as to this par-
ticular part What right has the Province of
New Brunswick to interfere in this matter at all'
I have before me a copy I procured some time
since of a map, entitled " Map of the British Pos-
sessions in North America, compiled fiom Docu-
ments in the Colonial Depai tment," and on the
bottom of it purporting that it was " oidered by
the House of Commons to be printed, 29th June,
1827 " It is contained in a volume of the Pailia-
mentary papers foi that year On it is the me-
ndian line which divides Maine from New Bruns-
wick, running due north, fiom the source of tha
St Croix, thence to the St John, crossing the St
John, and proceeding north to the head of the
Ristigouche This line leaves the whole of the
disputed territoiy west of New Brunswick, and
out of the limits oj that Province It even carnea
the northwest angle of Nova Scotia to the north
of the St John, as we say it should go, and
nearly to the point to which we claim Such is
the representation which the Colonial Department
itself gives of the boundaries of New Brunswick;
which is confirmed by the cunous fact that the
commission granted to the Earl of Durham as
Governor General of New Brunswick, in 1838,
which I find in the public papers, describes that
province in correspondence with the map re-
ferred to, and, indeed, just as we have always
contended it should be desenbed Now, I de-
mand what right the authorities of New Bruns-
wick have to cioss the meridian line, which every
book, map, and commission, which I have ever
seen, like these now before me, lays down as the
western limit of that province > Theieisbut one
answer to be given to this question Great Bnt-
ain has been dishonest in the matter She prefeis
a claim to a pait of the State of Maine, to which
she knows m her own conscience she has not a
shadow of rightful pretension This claim is
contradicted by so many of her own acts, that
the advocacy of it involves her in a labynnth of
deceit and falsehood She cannot print a map
touching the disputed territory, she cannot issue
a commission, even at this day, which shall not
give the lie direct to this groundless and unjust
claim—a claim as dishonorable to her as it is
insulting to the United States
Theie is but one other topic involved in this
measuie upon which I desire to be heard at this
time The Committee on Foieign Affairs have
proposed an appropriation for a special embassy
to England They have done this to manifest
the indisposition of the United States to go to
war, if it may be honorably availed, and the
willingness of Congress, provided Sir John Har-
vey shall abstain from any aggressive acts in the
mean time, to try once more the effects of nego-
tiation, before drawing the sword in defense of
the rights of Maine. But I desire to say that, in
assenting to this feature of the bill, I did not, and
do not mean to be understood as holding out any
encouragement to Great Britain that this contro-
versy is to be kept open by renewal of the evasive
and fruitless negotiations of the last ten years
No more delays—no more procrastinations—no
more of the diplomatic chicanery by which Great
Britain has so long sought to obtain from the
United States by maneuver what is not hers by
any just right, and what she cannot extort by
