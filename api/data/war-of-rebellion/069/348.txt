HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,May 30, 1864 - 7 a. m.

Brigadier-General GRIFFIN,

Commanding First Division, Fifth Army Corps:

GENERAL: the major-general commanding directs that you push a brigade down the road in your front till you find the enemy, and report the result.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. S. MARVIN, JR.,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST DIVISION, FIFTH ARMY CORPS,May 30, 1864 - 7 a. m.

[General G. K. WARREN:]

GENERAL: My skirmishers have advanced 1 1/2 miles. A citizen report that there was a considerable infantry force in my front last night, which is corroborated by negroes, and that it fell back a little after dark, starting (the men) that the rebel army was about 2 1/2 miles distant between Pole Green Church and Shady Grove. We are in hearing of the enemy's drums.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

CHAS. Griffin,

Brigadier-General.

I think this the most reliable information I have received.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,May 30, 1864 - 11 a. m.

General GRIFFIN:

General Warren desires that your pickets on the right form a connection with the pickets of the Second Corps before you advance much farther. The left of the Second Corps is on the other side of the Totopotomoy.

W. A. ROEBLING,

Major and Aide-de-Camp.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST DIVISION, FIFTH CORPS,May 30, 1864 - 2.15 p. m.

[General G. K. WARREN:]

GENERAL: I have the enemy in line and his artillery (rifled guns), and am in advance of the troops on my right, with a sharp fire on my left. I have halted until I receive further orders, or till the connection is made on my left, and the right moves up. The Second Brigade is in front, with the Twenty-second Massachusetts as skirmishers, and has done splendidly.

CHAS. GRIFFIN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
