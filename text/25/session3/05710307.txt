25th Gomg....3d Sess.                            Public Lands—Mr. Robertson.        ■                                Ho. of Reps.
you surrender the lands of Iowa, Wisconsin, and
Florida at íedured prices, or on the terms pro-
posed by the Florida military occupation bill
the population of Alabama and the new States
of the South would, in that case, flow into Flor-
ida, and that of Indiana and the western States
into Wisconsin and Iowa
There is no foundation, sir, for complaint in
reference to the price of the public lands When
gentlemen talk of the gieat ments and sufferings
of the haidy pioneeis of the West, they should
not forget those of the early settler of the old
States, from the landing of Sir Walter Raleigh to
thatofthePiIgnms Theyshould remember that,
■while for a moderate sum they purchase fertile
lands m the new States and Territories, the citi-
zens of other sections of the Union pay more than
double for lands of vastly inferior quality; and
that while the means of constructing roads and
canals and erecting schools andcolleges have been
supplied to them out of the -common funds, the
old States,with few exceptions, have been wholly
denied similarbenefits Yetgentiemen, with these
facts before their eye's, talk of oppression—oppres
Slotl in taxing them by the site of land at a price
confessedly below its real worth Lpt us foi a
moment, sir, test the lustice of the charge bv re-
ferí ing to their own example In some cases, I
am mfoimed, those States have obtained fiom the
Government leave to dispose of the school lands
originally granted to the townships Well, sir,
what has been the result* Indiana has sold hers,
I am told on an average, for four or five dollars
er acre, Ohiofor probablyas much ormore.and
lichignn has put up hers on the express condi
tion that not an acre should be sold below eight'
These school lands, it will be recollected,consist
of the sixteenth section in each township, and
must therefore be of an average value, asceitainly
as if drawn by lot Sn, I see no impiopnety in
this, tney act wisely and justly to augment their
resoinces by getting the value of then pioperty
But I use it to lepel the charge of injustice and
oppression, made by the new States against this
Government, by showing that their own citizens
experience greatei oppression from them than
irom us
I have thought it unnecessary, Mr Speaker, to
make any discrimination between the lands ceded
by the States and those purchased from Trance
or Spam, or from the Indians I believe—the
whole country believes—there is no substantial
distinction It cannot be that we have one law
for Louisiana and Missouri, and another for Ala-
bama and Ohio I will not stop at this time to
examine the constitutional question The con
stitutionality of these purchases has been well
defended under the war powei conferred by the
Constitution, as well as that to regulate com-
merce, and it must be acknowledged that, with
the command of the mouth of the Mississippi,
not only might our commerce be seriously an
noyed, but our interior country constantly ex-
posed to attack Be this as it may, the purchase
was made, the terntory has been formed into
States, and those States admitted into the Union,
so incorporated into our system that we could not
separate them, if we would, without impainngits
heilthful action, indeed, without vital injury
What, then, shall be done with the fertile regions
thus acquired ' In the statements furnished by
the Government,the amount paid has been treated
as a charge upon the funds arising from the sales
of the ceded lands Upon every principle of rea
son and equity, then, these acquisitions stand m
the place of the funds employed in the puichase
By the Constitution, moreover, full power lsgiven
to dispose of all public lands, without reference
to the mode in which they may be acquired If
it be said they stand, m any respect, on a differ
ent footing from the ceded lands, then how comes
it that donations have been made to Louisiana
and Missouri foreducation and internal improve-
ment, which can only be justified by resorting to
the onginal compacts of cession and oidmances
mdei them, applicable only to the ceded lands,
oi those which maystmd in then place' But
suppose tnt c s,m tiuth, mubstanti il difference
st II we hive the lands, we cannot abandon the n, ¡
at d have no more right to sunender tnem to one
poi tion of the people than to another There is
no rule that can be adopted more constitutional
or more just than to distribute them I would
consider them, Sir, as a great smplus fund, to be
distributed among Us common owners, as was
the great suiplus of money, a few years past, m
the Treasuiy You need not call it, sn, distribu-
tion call it, if you will, a loan, or a deposit, ora
lease for nine hundred and ninety-nine years, íe-
newable forever The name will be no objection,
provided the property be fairly divided among its
nghtful owners
Mr Speakei, I have submitted the proposition
before you in a spirit of concession If any have
a right to complain, it is the old States The dis-
tribution proposed is wholly pi ospective It does
not look back to what is past, or demand for the
old States, previous to a general distubution,
such appropriations as will correspond in a just
proportion with those heretofore made in favor
of other States This claim was not only as-
serted by Maryland and other States, as far back
as 1821, but has been renewed in the resolutions
recently adopted by the House of Delegates of
Virginia That there are just giounds for the
claim, I cannot doubt, but there are strong con-
siderations which lead me to btheve that the old
States themselves, actuated by the same spiut
which has ever induced them to pursue towaids
the new States a generous policy, will yield it,
provided just punciples shall heieaftei be pm-
sued in the administration of the common funds
I will state the reasons which should influence
them, as I think, to adopt such a policy The
ordinance of 1787 declares that schools and the
means of education shall be forever encouiagcd
It is certainly true that many and latge dona-
tions have been made for very different purposes,
but, as to them, the States obtaining them claim
to have paid an equivalent This ordinance and
these donations were made m part, or acquiesced
in by the repiesentatives of the old States If
an account were to be taken, it would be difficult,
if not impossible, to fix a standard by which the
value of the consideration could be estimated, or
the just proportions of other States ascertained
Ami more thin all, sn, the claim itself, if success-
fully asserted under such ciicumstnnces, would
generate an unfriendly feeling, for which the en
tire domain of the Union, spacious as it is, would
poorly compensate I offer these, sn, as my own
individual opinions As members of this House,
we have no power to say to the States they shall
not enjoy the full measure of their lights in the
public domain It is a sacied tiustwe cannot
violate As representatives of the States, we
were sent here to defend, not to abandon, their
lights and interests To guard, these, sir, the
proviso has been annexed, which leaves the ques-
tion how far those rights and inteiests shall be
waived or insisted on with the States, who alone
are competent to decide it
I had intended, Mr Speaker, to notice the
amendment contemplated by the gentleman from
Aikansas, [Mr Yell,] but have already tres
passed much longer upon the patience of the
House than I had intended I am not certain,
indeed, that I comprehend it, and will therefore
make but a single remark It calls appaiently
for an account of all benefits deuved by the old
States from the public lands since the origin of
the Government Well, sir, let this account be
taken, and then let all the expenditures of the
Government during the same period he also as-
certained those of the old revolutionary war, of
the late war, civil and military expenses of eveiy
kind, appropriations for purchasing Louisiana
and Florida, extinguishing Indian tides, and car-
rying on Indian wars Present both sides of the
account, and I labor under a great mistake if the
balance found against the gentleman's own State
will not constitute a mortgage ample enough to
eat up every foot of land within its limits
The old States can fear no just settlement
They ask nothing more than their due None
can impute to them a grasping disposition If
any should, let them be suie there is in them-
selves no taint of cupidity Letthem set an ex-
ample of nob!  dismteiestednesf, ard offer better
teimstous than we oiler to them Le.. thorn pre
s nt any p! m moie reasonable, -nore ju¡.t, and
foi one Í will give it my heaity suppoit If not,
then, m an equal spun of candoi, let them take
ours     I trust, sir, it will be adopted
It is simple in itself, it may be described in
two words divide fairly—divide fanly the com-
mon pioperty
It changes no system
By avoiding new compacts, it avoids contro-
versies with the States
It draws no money from the Treasury neces-
sary to meet the just expenditures of the Govern-
ment, and consequently obviates all pretext for
an increased tariff; while, by distributing the
excess, it prevents wasteful appropriations to a
partial system of internal improvement
It is in fulfillment of our solemn covenants,
conformable to our fundamental law, and rests on
the eternal foundations of justice.
I address myself to the representatives of the
old States Is it not our light  If so, why-
shall We surrender it' I warn them their con-
stituents will expect them to answer the ques-
tion The people are in action, and rely upon
it, sir, they are in earnest. Hear the language
just addressed to us by the State of New Jer-
sey
" Issuing from the toil  and sufferings of our revolution
ary struggle, exhausted in everything but patriotism und
honor, she has been left to provide her own common school
fund, to build and endow liei own icademies and colleges,
and to construct her own r-ulroads and canals, by sucli
ways and metns as she could device She has looked to
the public lands, in pan acquired by liervalor or purchased
with lier treasure, as a source from which she might here-
after ejpect aid in educating her sons, in developing her
mtmal resources, in facilitating the intercourse of her em
¿ens, and in accomplishing other similar purposes which
constitute the true glory and wealth of a State Cut an at-
tempt, it would seem, is to be made to strip her, in piece-
meal or in mass, of tins property, to which she is entitled
by every punciple of law and justice It may be that it
vi ill succeed , but u shall not be with her consent, nor with
out her remonstrance "
Sir, this is strong language, and it is to be re-
fretted there should ever be occasion to use it
3 it not an interest of transcendant importance
to secure to the present and future generations
the benefits to which theyaie entitled, benefits
which they may receive not only without doing
wrong to any, but by conferring benefits on those
from whom, in turn, they derive them' For the
fertile lands they transfei will lepay tenfold their
cost Why, then, should this incalculable tieas-
ure be thrown away' surrendered piecemeal or «re
mass'' But, immense as are the consequences in
a pecumaiy view, infinitely more important are
they in a moral and in a political aspect As you
shall settle this question, you may perpetuate
harmony or generate lasting dissensions among
us
But now is not the time Postpone—postpone
Tor neaily twenty years have your constituents
been knocking at your dooi How much longer
will their seivants—no, sir, their masters—in this
Hall deny them admittance' Amid the thousand
fuvolous questions which occupy months of our
time, can we not devote one week to a subject
beyond comparison the most impoitant which
could attract our notice ' Can we not spare four
days' In that time the old convention of my
State, computing fiom the day it was reported,
adopted the Constitution which radically changed
the form of our Government, and which remained
unaltered for upwards of fifty years Yet gentle-
men—from the old States, too—when they know
it is in then power, if they will, to adopt this
measure to morrow, cannot spare the time to do
justice to their constituents, and secure incalcu-
lable blessings to future generations
I appeal to the Representatives of the new States
themselves Have not your brethren been just'
have they not been generous to you' and will
you not be just to them' Let us, on all sides, sir,
come together as brethren of one family, disdain-
ing to t>eek unjust advantages in sharing the
common patrimony It is a sense of mutual ben
efit, more than all, of reciprocal justice, which,
as with hooks of steel, diaws State to State, man
to man, heart to heart That—that alone—will
keep bright and strong the chain of our Union;
bind us more closely together than parchment
bonds, or penal statutes, or armed mercenaries
Let us now, sn, and at all times, meet in that
fraternal spirit which actuated our fathers, and
our friends] lp wi'l be as deep a, the fathomless
oceans which wasn our s1 ores, and durable as
the eveilasting hills which overlook our bound-
less domain
