Colonel O. D. GREENE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

It is not practicable to give me the two companies of the Ninth Cavalry Missouri State Militia at Rolla? I believe duty can render far better service in this district than elsewhere.

HUNTSVILLE, MO., September 21, 1864.

Colonel O. D. GREENE,

Assistant Adjutant-General and Chief of Staff:

The indications now are that guerrillas are concentrating near Rocheport and I am making dispositions accordingly. I have ordered Lieutenant-Colonel Matthew with his command from Sturgeon to Rocheport to occupy and scout that region. Three companies of Colonel Forces' regiment will go to Sturgeon to-night and operate secretly on foot from that point. The balance of the regiment will move to Glasgow and Keytesville as soon as organized. Colonel Kutzner will operate from Macon and Paris. I fear we have been treacherously dealt with in Chariton County in the surrender of Keytesville. I shall go there in person and investigate. Telegrams will reach me form Glasgow to-morrow. I move again at midnight.

HEADQUARTERS, Saint Louis, September 21, 1864.

Major-General CURTIS:

All information goes to show that Price crossed the Arkansas with cavalry, and much to show he had infantry and artillery. One of General Steele's scouts, arrived at Springfield, estimates strength at 26,000, General Steele ought to destroy him with the 2,000 infantry lately added to his command. Can't you retain the Second Colorado till we see whether they move on Missouri and Kansas, which I think is their policy to do if they come north. I have no troops at present with which to replace them.

LEAVENWORTH, September 21, 1864.

Major-General CURTIS:

Had you not better let your troops go south and leave the militia take care of the posts?
