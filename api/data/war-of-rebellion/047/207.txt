CHARLESTON, S. C., July 18, 1863.

Brigadier General R. S. RIPLEY,

Commanding First Military District, Charleston, S. C.:

GENERAL: It is the wish of the commanding general, in the event we are obliged to abandon Morris Island, that Brigadier-General Taliaferro shall transfer his headquarters to Sullivan's Island, where, meantime, about the force of a brigade of infantry should be placed, to be employed on the defenses of that island under either Brigadier-General Clingman or Colquitt.

The subsistence stores on Sullivan's Island, not sheltered by bomb-proofs, should be removed and stored, as far as practicable, out of range from Morris Island.

All houses on that island which are in the way you will please have torn down, using the material for any defensive purposes which may be found practicable, especially shelters against fire of the enemy for the infantry supports.

Please give your attention to all practicable means for securing the deliverance, in extremity, of all our force from Morris Island, to which end, boats, barges, and flats should be collected and kept in serviceable condition at or near Fort Johnson.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

THOMAS JORDAN,

Chief of Staff.
HDQRS. DEPT. SOUTH CAROLINA, GEORGIA, AND FLORIDA,Charleston, S. C., July 18, 1863.

Brigadier General R. S. RIPLEY,

Commanding, &amp; c.:

GENERAL: The commanding general has considered your letter of the 18th instant, and approves the arrangements which you have made for the exigency of an evacuation of Morris Island, though he hopes it may not be necessary as yet, in view of the little damage done, as reported by General Taliaferro at 6 p. m.

It would appear from the intercepted dispatch* that an attempt to carry Wagner by assault will be attempted; for this the general commanding wishes all practicable preparations made. Harrison's regiment, as you propose, should be thrown upon the island if possible, but the Fifty-first North Carolina should not be brought away until about daylight, unless you can relieve it during the night, without difficulty, by another regiment besides Harrison's. Of course during the day the garrison must be reduced as far as practicable.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

THOMAS JORDAN,

Chief of Staff.

CHARLESTON, S. C., July 18, 1863.

Brigadier General THOMAS JORDAN,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: The battery yon Shell Point is sufficiently completed to receive the guns. Hands are at work on it to-night, and will finish it by 10 o'clock to-morrow. One 10-inch gun is mounted, the other
