SAMUEL CALDWELL,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS SIXTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Memphis, Tenn., October 13, 1863.

Major-General SHERMAN,

Corinth, Miss.:

I forward you copy of letter* from Major-General Grant of the 8th. Much of this has already proved trued. There is no doubt but that a force has been pushed forward as far as Okolona some time since, as I informed you, and that the country is comparatively clear in rear of Vicksburg.

Chalmers was attacked at Ingraham's Mill below Byhalia by Hatch, about 2.30 yesterday. Phillips' brigade should have got up by 5 p.m., and Sweeny, if he marched to the cannon, could have been there this morning.

Cannonading has been heard in that direction to-day about 10 a.m. Results are not known, but there is scarce any excuse if they are not cut up. Our prisoners were run to Oxford, and are said to be 108.

I shall push out all forage and supplies practicable to Corinth, and keep the road up to its full capacity.

No news from above.

Your obedient servant,

S. A. HURLBUT,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF MEMPHIS,October 13, 1863.

[Major-General HURLBUT:]

GENERAL: I send you the message of General Chalmers, brought to the lines under flag of truce. I directed Colonel Moore to receive the message and dismiss the party. One object in sending the flag of truce was no doubt to ascertain whether any forces were being sent from here toward Byhalia.

Very respectfully,

JAMES C. VEATCH,

Brigadier-General.
