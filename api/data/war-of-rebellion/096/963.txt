on our extreme left. The signal officers report the enemy under arms and in line in vicinity of the lead-works and to the left, which would seem to confirm deserters' reports, as this line held by Johnson's division.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Dispatches from Sheridan, Sherman, and Schofield received and circulated. I am glad to hear Schofield's account of Lee's reported victory, and hope Kilpatrick's defeat, as reported by Lee in yesterday's Richmond papers, will prove of the same character.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,March 14, 1865-12 m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Warren telegraphs some deserters have just come in from W. H. F. Lee's division of cavalry, who left their lines at 9 p.m. yesterday, and who report a movement of Lee's division yesterday at 9 a.m. toward Dinwiddie Court-House. I have sent for these men, to examine them more particularly, and if Lee has moved his cavalry I think it would be well to send Davies out to find out what is going on. I have directed Davies to hold himself in readiness. Signal officer reports great activity and apparent excitement in the enemy's lines in the vicinity of Fort Mahone, near Jerusalem plank road.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.

CITY POINT, March 14, 1865-2.30 p.m.

Major-General MEADE:

Since telegraphing you in cipher I have seen a letter from lady in Richmond, in which she says that Fitz Lee's cavalry has been ordered on the Danville road. Private stores, tobacco, cotton, &amp;c., had been turned over to the provost-marshal to be got out of the way, and citizens were ordered to be organized. The information clearly indicates an intention to fall back to Lynchburg. Sheridan will be at the White House to-day. If there is no falling back for four or five days I can have the cavalry in the right place.

U. S. GRANT,

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,March 14, 1865-2.30 p.m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

I have examined the cavalry deserters, and they say positively that the two brigades of W. H. F. Lee's division hitherto at Stony Creek moved yesterday morning, with all their transportation, toward Dinwiddie
