General HUMPHREYS:

GENERAL: One of the prisoners taken states that the enemy in front was proceeding to Spotsylvania Court-House, and accidentally their flanks were against our line. This may account for their appearing in that direction. Mahone's brigade, of Anderson's division, was engaged. A scout whom I sent out from my right, a very intelligent man, and who witnessed the fight in the open clearing, says that afterward he saw some infantry coming over the Brock road yelling. I don't know the condition of the Artillery Reserve, and I don't know whether to send back the heavy artillery if there is no assault to-night.

Very truly, your obedient servant,

WINF'D S. HANCOCK.

A deserter from this brigade says that there were more troops behind.

General HUMPHREYS,Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: The heavy artillery brigade has arrived, but I have directed it to return, as I have two brigades in reserve and some little reserve elsewhere.

General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

In reference to the Twenty-second New York Cavalry, I would say that it has reported to me and is in rear of my column. The Second Ohio and other regiments of that brigade were ordered by General Burnside to follow him, so the colonel commanding reports to me. Three of my divisions are in and the fourth coming up.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General, Commanding.

General Warren is at Spotsylvania Court-House with his own corps and one division of Sedgwick's. It is presumed General Warren will be able to what is assigned him, but the command must be held in that species of readiness which will enable the corps to move at short notice. Let the men get water by detail.

By command of Major-General Hancock:

FRANCIS A. WALKER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
