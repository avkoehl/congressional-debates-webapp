HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,May 30, 1864 - 7.20 p. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

Your order was received at 7.10 p. m. I have directed each division commander to assault at such point of his line as he may deem best. General Barlow has already replied that he will attack at once. I have also directed my artillery to open. General Ricketts, who is on Birney's right. ought to move at the same time to protect Birney's right. General Birney has just sent word that he will attack on his right, and if General Wright moves, it will assist him materially.
