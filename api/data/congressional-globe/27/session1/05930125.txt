Senate.
measures associated with it, would also force their
way through Congress. Yes., it had cause for joy
and rejoicing
This bill is the entering wedge for all the mea-
sares of the session, and on which it is proposed to
rear a splendid superstructure of the paper system
—Bank, debt-, and stocks—rivalling that of Great
Britain He is blind, indeed, who does not see, m
the signs of the times, a strong tendency to plunge
the Union as deeply in debt as are many of the
States, and to subjugate the whole to the paper sys-
tem. Every movement and measure indicates
it What are we doing, and what engrosses
all our attention from morn to noon, and from
week to week, ever since our arrival here, at the
commencement of th^ extraordinary session, and
will continue till its end? What but banks-, loans,
stocks, tariffs, distribution, and supplies? All elss
is forgot and absorbed m these, and w hat are these,
but parts and parcels of the paper system?
On such an occasion, wnen a revoluuon is at-
tempted m the Governm-nt, he felt bound, as the
representative of one ot the sovereignties of this
Union, to give utlerance to his opinion, with all
posible freedom, within the limits assigned by par
hamentary rules to the liberty of discussion I
then proclaim that Wall street (the head and centre,
m our country, of ihe great moneyed, bank, stock,
and paper interest, domestic and foreign) is, in the
ascendant in the councils of the Union. Every mea-
sure is contiolled by it, and at its pleasure, Banks,
brokers, and stickj ibbers, sway every thing, end
this is the only fruit of the victory of the party,
which has been so triumphantly chanted from one
extremity of tne Union to the other All else are
neglec ed—forgot'en. No, not all The office
seeker*, aie remembered Í hey come in for their
share. Between them cur time is excljsively di-
vided, laboring hourly and da ly for the one in se
cret, and the other ai open session
As to the people, what attcn ion do t^y retei/e'
They want economy and retrenchmen, light taxes
and moderate expenditures On these not a thought
is bestowed, although they wee told, during the
late canvass, by those now in power, and truly so,
that there was much to reform—-much u« less and
wasteful expenditures to retrenca, accompanied by
solemn pledges for reform if victory should place
power in their hands All these are no v forgot-
ten or postponed. I say postponed, for the chair-
man of the Committee of Finance has io'd us,
that, at the next session, these pledges are to be
redeemed So then the favori'e few—tne money
mongers and office seekers—ate to be first s"rved
—to sit at the first table—and the people to have
the bones and crumbs ot the second, if, indeed,
they should be permitted to share at all in the
fruits of the victory. Instead of sharing the fruit*,
they will share, I suspect, the fate of one of the
most patriotic and intelligent corps of recruits,
which swelled the ranks of the victors in the late
election; I refer to those who were enlisted by the
promise that pro-cnpuon should be proscribed, so
solemnly given, and so often repeat d from th=
gentral-m-chief down to ihe lowest recruiting s r-
geant, but which has been broken in utier contempt
and scorn of plighted faith.
Another respectable corps of recruits are doomed
t >hare the same, if not a more disgraceful (ate.
I refer to the large portion of theS'ate Rights men,
who rather voted against Mr. Van Buren, thin for
General Harrison, and who were induced to hopa
from declamation from high source  during tne
canvass, that the pure days of the old State Rights
Jeffersoman doctrines would be restored it Mr
Van Buren should be defeated Where do they
now stand? Where stand all but the respectable
porUin,wuich have already discovered the decep ion
and returned to their old standard? In tne Links
of the bnter and determined opponerts of all they
ever proiessed and contended tor, dooi-ed, unless
they speulily separate üorn faithless aliies, to loss
of caste and endless disgrace
And what 1. to become of that mighty mass who
were governed, wt hout reason or reflection, by
the mere force of pecuniary pressure, to seek
change— n wh we ears, change, change, change,
was incessantly rung' Have prices improved'
Have times become better? or will they, in conse-
quence of these measures? Far otherw, e The
agitation, whiqh they have already caused,
and which they must continue to c?use, and the
powerful disturbing ínllaence, which they must
have, if adopted, on the currency and vhe money
market, are the most deadly foes to the revival of
_ business They have already done much to de-
press trade, and destroy confidence, and should they
unfortunately succeed, will do more to prevent the
return of prosperous limes, than any other step
that could be taken The end will be that this,
like every othei corps of recruits that swelled the
ranks of the victors, except the two exclusive fa-
vorites here, office seekers and money mongers,
are doomed to sad disappointment
Mr NICHOLSON addressed the Senile as rol-
lows
Mr President It is a smgalat fact that
amidst all ihe discussions, which have taken place
in the two Houses of Congress, on the Treasury
report, and the loan bill, scarcely two gentlemen
have come to the same ccnc!u«ion, as to the pre-
sent condition of the Treasury Gentlemen of the
highest financial abilities, have differed, and dif-
fered widely in their einc'usions It is by no
means certain, that the Secretary of the Treasury
himself understands the true condition of his De
partment Indeed, sir, I might almost venture to
affirm that he does not We have an acknowledg-
ment from htm, that h.s report at llv commence-
ment of the sess on contained one error of about
half a million of dolíais The Senator from New
Hampshire [Mr Woodbury] has pointed out and
demonstiated the exist'«  of ino her error of
equal amount, whilst other gentlemen asseit wi h
confidence, lhat thes~ do notconsiitute the whole
This sta e oí c mfnwon and uncertainty is
mos* remarkable when it is remembered that
it has Dtin but four months smce tne nt w
books were o>en d ¡We were tauntingly
told at the las* se n, that our old books
would be laid aside lhat a new set would be
onened on the 4th of Ma e1', and the accounts he
fept entirely dis'imt Well, sir, the new books
ha? e be n opened, and at the end of four months,
we fnd it impossible ¡or the Seeretarj, or any
body el-e, to rely confidently upon the report made
from them I am very far from being so impru-
dent as to attempt to elucidate a subject which has
puzzled so many others mu"h better skilled than
mjself in tne finances of tne Government. I al
lude to it merely to show how uncertain are the
estimates on wluch we are now called upon to
grant supplies by borrowing twelve millions of dol-
lars
But, Mr President, there are a fen points con-
nected with the fiscal operauon of the Govern-
ment, which are uncontroverted It is not contro-
verted that there is a fixed rule by which every
Secretary of the Treasury for fifty years has been
governed in determining upon the amount oi mc-
ney to be annually expended That rule, so well
established and so unnorm'j fallowed, is to («i.e
the amount  f 'he annual aoprvpriahons by Congress
as the true amount to be annually expended V ora
misrule, His ddrxuiUd the present Scere'vy of
the Treasury has departed lns'eai of limiting
the expenditures to nineteen milhons of dolíais,
which is about the amount of appropnat on- for
the year, made at the last session ot Congress, he
proposes to swell the expenditures for the year to
about twenty four millions '
Another point which is not susceptible of contro-
versy, is, that if the present Secretiry of the Trea-
sury had been content to expend only an amount
equal to the appropnat ons made by Congress at i s
laie session, he would have had ample means to
eany on the Government oVmg tht present >ear
In hts report he estimates th<" means of the Tre?-
sury, from the 4 h of March, at over twenty wil
hins of dollars mo'e than one million above Vie ap-
propnanons From the e fncts, which are unde-
niable, I draw the irresistible inference that Con-
gress has been unnecessarily called together m
extra session The report of tne Secre'ary of the
Treasury furnishes, the most conclusive proof that
the Government could have b en comfonably car-
ried through the present year upon the means al-
ready provided, but for the unprecedented policy
ot the Secretary him-elf in expending more than
the amount appropriated Whatever necessity for
this extra session exists, was produced by this inno-
vation of the present Secretary of the Treasury
upon the established rule of the Treasury Depart"
ment for fifty years.
There is still another uncontroverted point to
which I will allude It is undisputed lhat the late
Secretary of the Treasury, now the Senator from
New Hampshire, [Mr Woodbury,] on the 4th of
March last, left m the Treasury more thaa
six hundred thousand dollars; that amongst
the last acts of the late Administration was
one to provide for the issur or five mil-
lions of dollars in Treasury notes, for the benefit
of the present Administration These are admitted
facts, and yet we are now assured by the Senator
from Kentucky, [Mr. Clay,] and it is no doubt
true, that all this money, together with the acera
¡ug revenue, averaging about one million of dol-
lars per month, all has been drawn from the Trea-
sury except about tight or nine hundred thousand
dollars. I doubt not for a moment that the chair-
man of the Finance Committee [Mr. Clay] repre-
sents the condition of the Treasury truly when he
informs us. that it is in urgent need—that it is near-
ly empty, or, to use a phrase which was familiar
some time since to ¡senators on the other side, (ha
Treasury «s bankrupt. In this state of things, the
proposition to borrow twelve millions of dollars is
not free fr >m embarrassment I am called upon
to vote supplies to an amount double that which
I bel eve 11 be necessary. I am called upon to
supply a deficit which I am satisfied has occurred
in consequence of a  unskilful poliev adopted by
the Secretary of he Treasury—% policy condemn-
ed by the praciice of every Secretary ot the Trea-
sury for fifty )ears Sull, sir, we are required to
make provision ¡or in empty Tieasuiy, aad lean-
not reconcile it to my notions of duty to suffer the
Government to remain embarrassed, although I
am satiified this unfortunate state of things has
resulted from the unskilful management of the
head of the Treasury Department, unless, in giving
relief, I must violate some great principle To
save and mainta n the credit of the Govern-
ment unimpaired, I am ready to vote as much
as I believe to be necessary 'or the existing exigen-
cies From the best estm ve I have been able to
make, with all the lights afforded by the Treasury
report, and ihe discussions on both ¡.ides, I am fully
satisfied that six rrilhc ns of dollars will be an am-
ple sum for the service of the pre ent year, even
under the administration of the present Secretary
of the Treasury I have, therefore, voted to reduce
the loan to that amount, and that I might not seem
to desire to embarrass the Government, I have
voted to reducen to nice millions, which is the ut-
most sum estimated to be necessary during the
present year, as I understood fiom the remarks of
the Senator from Maine, [Mr Evtss ] Thse pro-
positions hav been rejected, and I am now to de-
cide whel ier I am bound by my duty here to vote
a supply of twelve millions wuh a contingent
power to ncrets^ it to cight-en millions
In this condition of the Treasury, Mr. President,
trie hi 1 under consideration presents a question of
grave moment—a question mvolvingin its decision
a fundamental principle oí constitutional liberty.
It presents the question «■hslher Congress can,
cons stent y witn sound principles of Republican
governmen , delegate to thi. Executive the power of
rais n^supplies not merely to meet existing exigen-
cies^ it exigencies which may possiblv occur during
the next jear, and afer Congress ¿hall be again
in session    Senators who advocate the bill have
whjlly failed to show that twelve millions of dol-
lar*, much less eighteen millions, wi 1 be needed
before another session of Co igress   Tbey contend,
ho\ ever, thpt we shi uld not limit our estimates to
the pre ent j ear, but s íould look into possible exi
genuts which may occur subsequent to another
meeting of Congress    Tne Se.iatois wuh whom I
am acting maintain that the raising of supplies be-
longs, of right, to  Congress, and that the power
should never be delegated to the Execut.ve, to be
exercised to meet pxigencies which Congress itself
can provide for    If Senators on the o her side are
right in leokmg to possible exigencies during the
