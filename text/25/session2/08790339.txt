Removal of the Treasury Building—Mr. Lincoln.

itself, and to the grounds upon which it 1  sustained
by the committee by whom it has beet  reported
The first proposition contained in the bs'l is, an
authority to the President of the United Slates "to
cause the unfinished walls of the Treasury build-
ing, now in the progress of construeuon, to be
taken down," and the report of the Committee on
the Public Buildings justifies the proposition, by
representations of the unsmtableness of the plan to
the site of the building, the bad arrangement of the
interior parts of the structure, and the defective
character of the work    Of these in their order
To the first po nt of objection I have already had
occasion to call the attention of this committee,
when inferring to the act of Congress under the
authority of which the building was commenced
That act contemplated a simple edifice for the
accommodation oí the Treasury only, and the ap-
propriation of §100,000 to the object ma/ be
regarded as some indication, at least, of its antici-
pated cost and extent But it is not to the enlarge-
ment of the plan oí the structure that the objection
is intended to apply This may, indeed, transcend
the authority of law, but is not a mattei within the
appropriate cognizance of the committee of which
I have the honor to be a member It is to the
plan of the building, in connection with its actual
position, the means of access to its accommoda-
tions, and its convenient occupation and use
These are not now subjects for doubt or specula-
tion The foundations of the building are laid, and
the superstructure has risen upon them They are
visible to Ihe eje, and the defects are obvious to the
remark of every observer Will gentlem n but
accompany me to the site of the edifice, they wiH
there see an extended base of several hundred feet,
upon an inclined plane of more than fourteen feet,
with one end buried in the earth, and the other
elevated as far above the adjoining foot-way
They will find the face of the building so pro-
troded upon the line of the street as to allow room
only for a passage from the side-walk to ihe plat-
form of a splendid colonnade, and thence to the
principal halls, by a flight of narrow side-steps
perpendicular to the base, and under which, also,
must be the entrance to the front corridor of the
basemenl They will see, to their greater surprise,
as I apprehend, what must be an anoma'y in the
process ot architectural construction, the front and
rear walls of a stone edifice carried to the height
of two stones, with both ends open from the foun-
dation, and with a durable brick building in the
way of closing the one, and no authorized or deter-
minate mode for completing either. Had ihe build-
ing been but thiown back from the stnet, and con-
structed upon the design approved by the Commitfe
on the Public Buildings of the last Congress, bad
as was the site, all (hese difficulties would have
been avoided By anj mode in which it may now
be finished, its po nion will be most awkward, its
appioach inconvenient, anchts general appearance
reproachful to the architectural skill and taste of
the country
But, Mr Chairman, I have yet to learn upon
what precise plan it is proposed even that the un
finished walls shall be carried out They are now
of unequal extent from the centre, and at the nortn,
which is (heir shortest arm, appioach withm some
three or four feet of the building occupied by the
State Department Here is no room for extension,
but over the foundation of that edifice What,
then, I ask, is to be done' Is it the intention to
des roy this valuable building' The plan, which
hangs in the lobby behind me, indicates this It is
the plan of the architect, and one of the wings, de-
lineated m the diawing,is made to occupy the very
site of the present building Or are the walls to tirw i-
nate with their present extent' How, then, is the
building to be closed, and in what mannei the end
finished' The committee n ere told, in answer to
the object on, that the front approach was narrow
and inconvenient, that the main entrances were
designed to be at the ends, directly opposite to the
principal halls, or passageways, of the building
But what space is there left for this accommoda-
tion, either for entrance or light to the passages
between the two buildings, now brought almost
into juxtaposition with each other' And at the
other extremity, too, the south end of the building,
with its mam entrance/ourfeen. feet above the level
of the ground, what here is the plan of completion'
and how are you to ascend from the street' If the
design, as shown upon the plan, be earned out, the
building is yet to be extended in this direction some
ninety or a hundred feet, and steps descending from
that extremity, at the elevation of the passageway,
will reach far into the avenue, upon the south
Sir, if any one knows what is the present plan of
execution, he has more information than I have
been able to acquire
A second reason with the committee for report-
ing the bill was the bad arrangement of the inte-
rior of the structure, and the want of adaptation
to the purposes for which it was assigned These
objections rest not m tas'e or opinion only The
defects are palpable, primary in importance, and,
in the present advanced state of the bu Idmg, be-
yond remedy Tney consist in the narrowness
of ine halls or passage-ways, and the want of pro-
vision for the admission of sufficient light to the
rooms The bni'dmg, carried out according to
the plan, w 11 be 456 feet m length, while the pnn.
cipal halls, running lon„i ddinaily through thi
great extent, when fim heri, in the three upper stos
nes, will be hardly more than nine feet in width-
and, in the basement, but little exceeding eight
On this part of the subject, I beg leave to read an
extract from the report of Mr Walter, as descrip-
tive of the character and consequences of this fault
of construction
'I should remar t uiv h° tha all the passages in tt e
build ng are entirely too n<*i row for either beauty convenience
or comiort The mam passage by which ait the rooms aie
approached w 11 be o ir hundred and fifty six feet m length,
(should the whole deei<m be carried ouf ) while its width is
o dy aive and a half feet Ih" only means of lighting this
passage is by a window ol fourteet by eight at each end ard
the eco liryli 'it it may receive from th" cross entries, stair

tb m lch ! ght at each erd -, < ill possible have been mtr )
duced Ampler arrangen ents s ould a &o have been made
ioi introducing interme iaoli°hts
I may permitted, I trust, to refer also to the au-
thonty of Capt Parns, m support of the opinion of
Mr Walter    He states, that—
"Considering the length of the budding the number of rooms
to be entele 1 tbiough this passage the many occupants and
others havin0, occasion of ingress and egress through it, in my
opinion this great thoioughfare for the whole building should
have been at least flf een fee m w idth and I have not seen
any sufficient reas in for coi fining it to its present reduced
limits    I corsidet this d fee wnhout remedy '
On the authority of the-e two expenencad and
accomplished artists, t might seem that the objec-
tion was conclusive Bui rest not here There
are facts, in the practice of the architect of the
bull line, which speak a language a^ unequivocal
as the opinions I have cited The Patent Office,
now in the course of construction, under his super-
intendence, of little more than one-half the extent
of ihe Treasmv build ng has a passageway of
fifteen feet, and uehav  all seen upon our desks,
at the present session, a p an for a Marin  Hos-
pital, prepaied by this very architect, of less than
tv o hundied feet m length, with a like breadth ot
fifteen feet passages Wherefore, then, this gieat
contraction m the most necessary and on-frequent-
ed part ot the Tieasurv building' Wnethet it re
suit from mistaire or design, the effect is the same,
and alike injurious Either fifeen feet passage-
wajs m a structure of one or two hundred feet in
length are wastefully improper, or nine feet in an
edifice of four hundred and fifty feet is insufferably
defect ve Had I not dismissed from regard the
report of the architect, I might cite with effect his
distinct admission that, "m respect to the width of
the comdors and passage-waj«, it would have add-
ed mm h to their beauty had th*y been half as w ide
again," and, as regards the lighting these corri-
dors and pavsage-ways, the pregnant expression of
aocite/only "that they will njt be deficient in
light but that they will be sufficient for the trans-
action ot the business of pa-sing to and iro1" I
will applv to this but the single comment, that, m
the present advanced state ot architectural science
and improvement, that must be but an nl construc-
tion, indeed, of a national edifice, which is less am-
ple in all its proportions than good taste demands,
and can only suoserve, by its accommodations, th 
most necessary and restricted uses.
Another branch of the same general objection of
want of adaptation in the arrangement of the
building to the purposes of its construction is, the
deficiency of light in the front range of rooms of
the basement and attic stones In the former, the
light can be but secondary and very imperrect. It
is first to be admitted through a thick wall, by win-
dows of only four feet square, into a corridor under
the platform ef the colonnade, and thence into the
rooms back of the corridor The dimensions of
the windows of the attic are the same, and these
will be much obscured by the columns and enta-
blature of the colonnade The light, whatever it
may be, must be admitted near the floor, below the
level of the height of the desks, and will not be-
sufficiently reflected for the necessary use With
this statement of position, it can hardly be neces-
sary to seek the opinions of architects, to satisfy
any considerate mmd of the efect But the decla-
rations of Messrs Walter and Parns are so direct
and explicit to this point, and so brief withal, that
I hope to be pardoned a reterence to them The
former remarks
The rooms in the basement storv will be entirely too dark
an J damp for office purposes, and the apartments m the thirds
(attic) story having windows but half the size of those below*
will be i>o darkened by the co onnade as to ren ier them aim >sl
t=eless The only comfortable uoms in Ux building will,,
therefore be found in the first and secor d btories which em
brace but seventy five apartments '
The latter gentleman expresses the opinion that,,
from such observations as he has been able to make
of the rooms m the basement story, "they will be
entirely too dark for the occupation of clerks, and
too damp, when closed, for the deposite of papers "*
In relation to the atuc, he observes
1 The windows of the attic are too small I was informed by
the superintendent of the work that they are to be onlv four feet
square the top coming only nv feet abo/e the floor Tne
soffit or under side of the entablature will be placed but a
small distance above the t ps o^the w ndows AH these ar
rangements combi te to render the rooms dark and, m n y
opinion, they will not be sufficiently lighted, especially in
cloudy weather to render them suitable for the occupation of
clerks
Is this, Mr Chairman, a building to satisfy the
expectations or the wants of the Government—a.
bui ding in which   one third  of  the   rooms   are
utterly   useless for   all   n=eded  purposes,'     Sir,
let it be remembered that this House ot Represen-
tatives,  by a resolution of the la«* session, called
upon the President for information of the numbei
«f apartments which  would be required for the
business of the Treasury     Inowho'diti my hand
a report to him from the Secretary of that Depart-
ment,  by which it appears that 133 rooms were at
this   time   wanted       The   act,  however,   under
which the building is being erected, directs that pro-
vision be made not only for the present, but for the
/«toe occasions of the Department     The present
edifice is to contain   bat 150 rooms in the whole
and such portions of these unfit to b« occupied as
to reduce the number below the immediate require-
ment    S r, I submit it to this committee if such
manifest violation o" the intention of the Legisla-
ture is not sufficient cause of i'self 'or arresting the
further progress of the structuie    Let none be de-
ceived by the suggestion that these objections are
the dictates of apprehension merely, or fie results
of a misguided judgment even    Tnere stand the
wali<;, witnin v ew of this Capitol, as witnesses to
facts     Tnere are the  narrow and darK corridors,
aid damp cells of the basement, to speak foi then-
selves     There are the contracted halls and pas-
sages of the first and second stories in the upi.smg
superstructure, with its open ard exposed ends, 10
be seen and  measured, in all their length   and
breadth     Feet and inches will not be     Tne attic is
j et to be added   But the plan of consiructio , <v hich
has been commenced must now b<> pui uea     Tne
entablature, with its fueze and cornice, must sur-
mount the columns, with then capitals, and ihe win-
dows be placed within the obscuration of Lg'it
which 'hey will occasion     That "these rooms will
be too dark for the occupation of clerks," we hive
the opinion of skilf ll buiHers, and neither the f cts
n rthe effects w 11 mj own judgment perm't  mp io
doubt     Here, then, we are again  brought  to a
stand    The inquirj is directly and pertinently t>re-
sented, shall an impei feet building, in abad loca-
tion, ard upon an objectionable plan, with Jo ir sto-
nes of rooms needed for occupation, and but two
suitable for use, be carried to its completion, or
shall the work of construction stop, the incumbrance
