Brigadier-General.

CUMBERLAND, MD., May 6, 1864.

Colonel WILKINSON, New Creek:

Do not permit the train to proceed to Greenland Gap until the country about Doll's Gap and over in the Patterson's Creek Valley above Burlington is thoroughly scouted.

B. F. KELLEY,

Brigadier-General.

CUMBERLAND, MD., May 6, 1864.

Colonel WILKINSON, New Creek:

If you are satisfied there is no enemy between you and Greenland Gap you might start the train. I would suggest you send a messenger to Colonel Porter and order him to send a force to meet the train at Doll's Gap; this will strengthen your escort and make it safe.

B. F. KELLEY,

Brigadier-General.

NEW CREEK, May 6, 1864.

General B. F. KELLEY:

Both telegrams received. Had country toward Burlington and Ridgeville scouted. No enemy found. Porter headed off McNeill at Oakland Junction and Northwest Grade, and the rebels then took round the Junction and blockaded. A force was sent from Petersburg to prevent their exit. They left the roads and paths and passed along the mountains, through the woods, moving for Reel's Gap, ten miles south of Petersburg, and escaped. I have detachments from Petersburg at Doll's Gap, and others from here above and below that gap to intercept should he have been compelled to cross the way he came. No enemy is known between here and Greenland, and I propose starting the train to-morrow morning, but will not do so until I again hear from you. Will make up statement of forces and send by to-morrow's train.

N. WILKINSON,

Colonel.
