Brigadier-General WESSELLS,

Commissary-General of Prisoners, Washington, D. C.:

GENERAL: Mr. Ould has by a notice in the Richmond papers declared all prisoners delivered for exchange or paroled by our Government to the Confederate up to November 25 exchanged.

I see no reason under the cartel or otherwise why a similar declaration should not be made both for naval and army prisoners of war received on parole for exchange by us up to that time. Please advise me and I will issue such declaration, as provided in the cartel.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Major-General, Commanding.
