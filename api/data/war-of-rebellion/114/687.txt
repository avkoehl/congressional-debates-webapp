SIR: I inclose a copy of a dispatch received on Saturday night. As the Baltimore had received orders to said I did not telegraph it to you as I should otherwise have done.

I know nothing of the two gentlemen first named in it (Messrs. Claggett and Salmon) except that they are members of the House of Delegates from Frederick County and decided secessionists.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
