Brigadier General WILLIAM D. WHIPPLE,

General Salm telegraphs me from Dalton that General Wilson has sent Lieutenant Bayard in charge of Governor Brown, of Georgia, a prisoner, under orders to report him to Secretary of War at Washington, and that they have arrived at Dalton. Shall they be forwarded here and on to Nashville, and in what manner?
