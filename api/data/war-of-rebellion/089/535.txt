Captain J. P. FINKELMEIER,

CAPTAIN: I have the honor to report that after inspecting myself thoroughly the amount and location of repairs to be done to the covered ways, I have ordered a sufficient detail to work at it to-morrow morning, in compliance with orders from division headquarters. I will keep the detail at work until the proper repairs are made, also to the breast-works between Fort Davis and Battery 22, as well as the two-gun battery in the rear Fort Sedqwick. A guard of six men and a corporal is already posted in these works to prevent any further damage being done in future.

Respectfully submitted.

DE TROBRIAND,

Brigadier-General.

Brigadier General S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I have the honor to report that all was quiet in my own front yesterday and last night. About 11.40 p. m. very heavy fire of musketry opened on my right, seeming to be in the vicinity of Fort Sedqwick. Rapid artillery firing followed immediately after, and continued for thirty or forty minutes. Nothing has been heard here of the result of the firing.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General, Commanding.
