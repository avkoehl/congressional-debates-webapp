hurt. My march to-day has been very satisfactory. Latest news from Springfield: Price was still there. General Frost arrived Friday or Saturday with a few men, and his battery, with about 400 men, was expected within four days. Firing heard to-day from that direction. Probably that re-enforcement has arrived.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

FEBRUARY 12, 1862.-Skirmish at Springfield, Mo.

Report of Brigadier General Samuel R. Curtis, U. S. Army.
HDQRS. SOUTHWESTERN DISTRICT OF MISSOURI,Springfield, Mo., February 13, 1862.

CAPTAIN: The flag of the Union floats over the court-house of Springfield, Mo. The enemy attacked us with small parties at 10.30 o'clock of the afternoon. At dusk a regiment of the Confederate cavalry attacked the outer picket, but did not move it. A few shots from a howitzer killed 2 and wounded several. The regiment retreated to this place, and the enemy immediately commenced the evacuation of the city. I entered the city at 10 a. m. My cavalry is in full pursuit. They say the enemy is making a stand at Wilson's Creek. Forage, flour, and other stores in large quantities taken. Shall pursue as fast as the strength of the men will allow.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

SAML. R. CURTIS,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

GENERAL: The enemy was attacked by my cavalry about half an hour since; he was then at Crane Creek.* Whether he will stand there or not is very uncertain, but I think it will be hard for his train and heavy artillery. He will probably move on through. I will try to attack him in rear to-morrow, but will delay if he stops until you can reach him. I regret that I can get no report from you, but hope you got my reply to yours this morning. I find one or two companies of Benton Hussars here, and will take them with me, as the nearest and best way for them to rejoin you. I hope you are able to reach the enemy or
