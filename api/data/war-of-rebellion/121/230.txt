to this time. A list of the names is herewith inclosed. There are three commissioned officers on parole: Colonel W. S. Hawkins, of Tennessee; Colonel J. F. Josey, of Arkansas, and Captain C. T. Smith, of Virginia. On the 12th of December, 1864, I received a communication from Brigadier-General Beall, C. S. Army, addressed to the Confederate prisoners of war at this camp (a copy of which I also inclose),* asking me to take the necessary steps to carry out the proposed arrangement. On the same day (December 12, 1864) I forwarded these papers to the Commissary-General of Prisoners, asking for instructions. The papers were returned with indorsement directing me to carry out arrangements entered into and approved by General Paine and inclosing a copy of General Orders, Numbers 3, dated December 16, 1864, from your office. Under these instructions I permitted the prisoners of war then at this post to select three officers, which resulted in the choice of those named. To perform their duties it was necessary that they should be permitted to visit all the prisoners and converse with them to ascertain their wants. The supplies when sent could not be received in prisons, I deeming it proper that they should be examined after being received by the Confederate agents before being distributed. In my opinion these duties could not be performed by them, nor safely permitted by us, unless these officers were placed upon parole. I therefore placed them upon special parole (a copy of which is inclosed), and forwarded a copy of the same to the Commissary-General of Prisoners December 24, 1864, for his approval, with an explanatory letter, a copy of which is also inclosed.+

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. P. RICHARDSON, Colonel Twenty-fifth Ohio Volunteers, Commanding.

RICHMOND, February 15, 1865.

Lieutenant Colonel JOHN E. MULFORD, Assistant Agent of Exchange:

SIR: I understand that Major J. Thompson has been in close confinement at Johnson's Island. For what cause I do not know, as I have already delivered to you every prisoner of war who had been at any time in close confinement or in irons in the South excepting Captain Shad. Harris, who will be delivered to you. I hope that Major Thompson will be speedily sent.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

RO. OULD,

Agent of Exchange.

RICHMOND, February 15, 1865.

Lieutenant Colonel JOHN E. MULFORD, Assistant Agent of Exchange:

SIR: I am informed by returned prisoners from Point Lookout that Private Gorman, of General Lee's scouts, is confined with ball and chain at that place. Why is this done? It is not contested that he is a regular Confederate soldier. Cannot this sort of treatment of soldiers be permanently prevented? I will thank you to return this man under our agreement.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

RO. OULD,

Agent of Exchange.
