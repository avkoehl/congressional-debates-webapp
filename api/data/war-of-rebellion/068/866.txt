General WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: I am just informed that the head of General Tyler's command has appeared near the gate posts, where you headquarters were to-day, in rather broken order. I shall now have half an hour to collect him and bring him on. He will evidently not be of much use in the assault. The First and Second Divisions are already formed, and the Sixth Corps is marching by.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General of Volunteers.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND CORPS,May 18, 1864-4.05 a.m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff, Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: Owing to the difficulties of advancing the picket-line, only one of General Wright's divisions is in position. General Wright, not being yet ready, I shall delay the assault a little. The other division of General Wright is now on the ground.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General, Commanding.
