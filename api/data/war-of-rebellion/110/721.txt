HEADQUARTERS BRIGADE,August 8, 1864 - 9 a. m.

W. H. JACKSON,

Commanding Cavalry Division:

GENERAL: My scouts inform me that the enemy extended his line to Baker's Ferry last night. His picket stands at the small creek, below the ferry, and at Donhoe's Mill. Colonel Broocks, just relieved from duty at the front, says there is a cavalry picket between Doctor Gilbert's and Kennedy's. Vedettes at the first house from Kennedy's toward Doctor Gilbert's. His men charged the vedettes this morning and captured their guns, canteens, &amp;c.

Very respectfully, &c.,

L. S. ROSS,

Brigadier-General.

MOBILE, AUGUST 9, 1864.

Honorable J. A. SEDDON:

Forrest reports enemy along the Mississippi Central, about 15,000; advanced beyond Abbeville yesterday evening. General PAGE and garrison, of Morgan, resolved. Wire not working to Morgan his morning. Immediate object of Canby was probably Gaines and Grant's Pass. Reserves, militia, employes, companies of consripts, two regiments heavy artillery, about 4,000 in all, now under arms here. Nothing from Lieutenant-General Taylor. I go to Meridian to-day.

D. H. MAURY,

Major-General.
