Taking up the line of march, escorted by the Cape Fear Rifles (Captain M. M. Hankins) held in reserve, I embarked the command on board the steamer W. W. Harllee, and with the transport schooner Dolphin in tow proceeded to Fort Johnston, where, arriving at 4 p. m., upon demand the fort was surrendered under protest by Ordnance Sergeant Reilly. At this post I detached Lieutenant Stevenson's company of artillery, and left that officer in command of the fort. The remainder of the command then proceeded to Fort Caswell, where, arriving at 6.20 p. m. upon demand, as before, the fortification property was surrendered by Fort Keeper Russell and Ordnance Sergeant Dardingkiller. In addition to the parties above named, I found Sergeant Walker, of the U. S . Army, residing at the fort, each with his family. Sergeant Walker, in consequence of the discovery of repeated attempts to communicate with his Government, was placed in close confinement to his quarters. Orders have been issued to remove these sergeants with their families to Smithville, and the quartermaster has been instructed to provide them with quarters for the present. Since I have taken possession of the forts, seven 6 - pounder guns at Fort Jackson, found is mounted and stored, have, under the direction of Major Radcliffe, assisted by Captain De Rosset, been mounted and placed in battery at that post. I find this fortification (Fort Caswell) in a dismantled and almost totally defenseless condition, their being but two guns mounted (their carriages being unserviceable) and no other carriages to be ad within the limits of the State, as far as I ma informed. For particulars as to the condition of the fortification, I respectfully refer you to the annexed report of the engineer in charge.* The acting adjutant- general, Edward Cantwell, arrived at this post this day on a tour of inspection with 2,000 sand- bags collected in Willmington, which are highly acceptable and will be used immediately in the defense of this post. I acknowledge with pleasure the prompt attention of that officer. I cannot refrain from expressing my thanks for the prompt manner in which this command have responded to the orders of the commander- in- chief and the spirit of both officers and men. I have as yet found it unnecessary to appoint but one officer of engineers and have to request that he and the officers of my regimental staff receive their commissions at the earliest practicable moment. Their names and offices will be found embodied in my report. For convenience I append them, viz, James D. Radcliffe, major of engineer; R. G. Rankin, quartermaster; John E. Lippitt, commissary.
