General J. G. PARKE

Chief of Staff, Leesborough, Va., [Md.]:

A telegraph dispatch was sent to General Burnside last night directing him to move his command this morning to Cracklintown and Goshen. The telegraph operator at Leesborough says he received the dispatch at 3 o'clock this morning. As no acknowledgment has been received of this dispatch, and as you say nothing of the movement in your telegrams, it is feared that the general did not get the order. The movement is an important one, taken in connection with the movements of other troops and it is desirable that your troops should occupy the positions named to-night. Please inform me at once whether the order was received and at what time.
