order direct to the commanding officer of the Eighty-first Ohio Infantry and Twelfth Illinois Infantry to move to forward and attack the enemy, which was most gallantly done, aiding in repulsing the enemy, and capturing 2 stand of colors and about 466 prisoners. The enemy having been repulsed in their frequent attacks on this front, in accordance with orders from the commanding officer of the Left Wing, Sixteenth Army Corps, this brigade was ordered to the support of the Second Division, Fifteenth Army Corps, and was deployed on the right of the railroad in the following order: Sixty-sixth Illinois Infantry Volunteers on the right, Eighty-first Ohio Infantry Volunteers in the center, Twelfth Illinois Infantry Volunteers on the left, resting on the railroad. This deployment having been promptly effected, the brigade was ordered to charge, which it did it the most prompt and daring manner, retaking the works from which the Second Division, Fifteenth Army Corps, had been driven, and recapturing 4 guns, 20-pounder Parrotts, of De Gress' battery, and capturing about 109 prisoners. The brigade occupied the works at this place until evening, when it was relieved and held as reserve of the Second Division, Fifteenth Army Corps. At 12 o'clock at night two regiments, the Eighty-first Ohio Infantry and Twentieth Illinois Infantry, were ordered to report to General Leggett,commanding Third Division, Seventeenth Army Corps, and remained subject to his orders until the 26th ultimo, when they were relieved and order to report to the commanding officer of the Second Division, Fifteenth Army Corps.

The entire capture by the brigade was 4 guns, 20-pound Parrotts (De Gress' battery), retaken, 2 stand of colors, 585 prisoners.

During this action the brigade was under command of Colonel August Mersy, of the Ninth Illinois Volunteer Infantry, and the present commanding officers regrets that this report could not have been made by Colonel Mersy, as the brigade was acting under his orders and immediate supervision, and greater justice could have been done the regiments of the brigade in the report than is possible by one whose connection with the command commenced after that action, and as the commanding officer is compelled to make this report from the reports of regimental commanders, nothing is attempted other than to give a condensed statement in reference to position, captured, losses, &amp;c.

The reports of the commanding officers of regiments are forwarded herewith, marked "Exhibit A."

I am, captain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JESSE J. PHILLIPS,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding.

Captain L. H. EVERTS,

Asst. Adjt. General, Second Division, 16th Army Corps.
