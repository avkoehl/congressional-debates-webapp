HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND, Chattanooga, November 24, 1863.

Major-General HOOKER:

Your success is glorious. Resupply ammunition if possible. We are crossing a brigade to connect with you. Send prisoners to Kelley's Ferry to be guarded. Take accurate list.

From the dense fog to-day I have not been able to learn much of the topography of Chattanooga Valley in my front. For this reason I suggest that the operations
