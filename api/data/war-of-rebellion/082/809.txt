HEADQUARTERS, July 27, 1864.

Lieutenant General R. H. ANDERSON,Commanding, &amp;c.:

GENERAL: A dispatch just received from General Kershaw has determined me to send General Heth's division to re-enforce him. I wish you to proceed to Deep Bottom and take command of the troops belonging to this army there. Examine the enemy's position, endeavor to ascertain his strength, and if practicable drive him away and destroy his bridges. Turn over to General Field the orders recently issued as regards strengthening his lines, &c., and direct him to make his daily reports to me.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE,

General.

CHAFFIN'S BLUFF, July 27, 1864. [Received 11 a.m.]

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General:

The enemy have appeared in force in front of New Market. I think the Local Defense troops had better be called out to occupy defenses within intrenched camp at Chaffin's.

R. S. EWELL,

Lieutenant-General.

WAR DEPARTMENT, C. S. A.,

Richmond, Va., July 27, 1864.

Lieutenant-General EWELL,

Chaffin's Farm:

To turn out the local troops causes serious derangement and confusion in all the departments. Unless you deem danger imminent or have some very special purpose to accomplish, would it not be well to delay or dispense with such call?

J. A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War.

CHAFFIN'S BLUFF, July 27, 1864-10 a.m. [Received 11.05 a.m.]

General SAMUEL COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General:

GENERAL: I do not find it necessary as yet to use the Local Defense troops.

R. S. EWELL,

Lieutenant-General.

CHAFFIN'S BLUFF, July 27, 1864-12 m.

General S. COOPER:

From information from the front, General Ewell not being present, I deem it strongly advisable that the local troops should be sent down to this point.

J. C. PEMBERTON,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Artillery.
