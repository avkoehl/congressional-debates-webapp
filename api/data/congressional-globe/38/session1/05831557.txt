mission to the laws. Judge Perkins, of the su-
pi eme bench of Indiana, never made a dictionary,
but he luis a good deal of law and abused and
berated tlx* Government as soundly as any man
living or dead, and eiiticised the war as severely
as if is m the power of either good or conscientious
flesh anil Mood to do. Still ho professes to be
a war Democrat, and is after Ins fashion, which
I consider a pretty bad fashion, and he talks
about subjugation without si'umitig to think there
is any harm m the word, and says:

if I were willing to go through with the speeches
made 011 the other side of the House I would have
no difficulty in finding much, wliethei so intended
or not, that gives aid add comfort, to the lebels in
arms.
My colleague [Mi. Voorhees] and ot^ei gen-
tlemen have resorted to a novel defense of the ac-
cused. I have sometimes known it resoited to
in had eases in courts of justice, huf have never
known it to be sanctioned by an upright judge,
and have seldom known it to prevail, it is in
substance that otheis have been unpaliiotic and
given utteiance to treasonable sentiments, and
they have attempted to prove the assertion by
sending to the Clerk's desk and having read long
extraeisfrom speeches,nowspapeiM, yellow ''lay-
ered " pamphlets, and other kmdied liieialuie,
wherein befoie tlie war Tom, Dick, or I tarry, as
the case might be, had expressed a willingness to
let the enemy go. The Helper book has been 1 ung
in. They forgetthatevery tub should stand on its
own bottom, and blind and stolid indeed must he
be that cannot see the difference between senti-
ments that might be uttered before the war and
those that may be spoken now to give aid and
comfortto th<' enemy, i would not, Air. Speaker,
utter an unkind wui tl. \V bat 1 have sani or may
say that may look like it is more, in sorrow than
in anger. The Senptuies of divine truth enj« m
it upon us to answer a fool oeemdmgto his folly,
and teach that wesomettines rightfully make unto
ourselves friends of tlie mammon of unrighteous-
ness. Pui suant to the fi> st clause of this injunc-
tion J presume I may light fully road from news-
papeis too, and adduce similar testimony. Of
course I do not nor cannot apply the epithet, but
only adopt the pi mo pie nini n ated. The epithet
applies not to any ^Mithman to whom 1 tefer.
Gentlemen sometimes use t-.'woids that, unfoi tu-
na te! y for them^eh *'S, cat hoth ways, and it ts said
to be a poor 1 i.le that wmi't woik bot h ways.
I read an extract fi uiu Rie.hmond papei s sonn -
time jigo which state:!, aecoiding to my lecoiiec-
tion, that my colleague ft 01 n ihe Tu re Haute d is-
ti ict [Mr. V oouiif.es] had made an unanswei able
argument; tiiat he had gathered together all tlie
aiguments that could be made m behalf of the 10-
beliiwn. I have not read the speech of my Tu-
b-ague [Air. Voojun.i:1)] alluded to by the Llich-
mond paper, and do uotknow whether the stnet-
uiesaie just or unjust. I heard the speech, it
is true, but not with thai distinctness thati could
have wished, notwithstanding it was utteied 111
clear and distinct tones. The distance between
us prevented. I would not state my colleague
v/iongfuily, and theiefme prefer to inseit the
article alluded to in my printed speech, (1 will
not stop to read it now,) that he may f>ee huw
lie is te^aided, and how his speech is interpiet-
ed way down in Dixie, and that he may pau^e
and consider whether, however well for bun-
combe and home consumption his speeches may
be intended, lie is not in point ot fact encoura-
ging the enemy, and inspntng them with hopes
that ought not to bo realized;

says we may includc him if the gentleman from
Ohio is to be punished for his utterances. Look
at the Toombs letter. What do you think ofthe
gentleman standing here and defending Mr. Long
who wrote that Toombs letter, or rather the re-
ply to it? "Is it true that arms"—and this
was after the firing was opened on Fort Sumter,
it was after the dogs of war were turned loose
—"is it true that arms belonging to Georgia
were seized in the city of New York? An
early answer is important not only to Georgia
but to New York." Such is the language of the
traitor Toombs to the patriot Wood. There is
an innuendo. What does it mean? Does it mean
an understanding between them in days gone by ?
"An early and satisfactory answer is important
to Gt'OiguxandNew York!" What did the gen-
tleman from New York reply? " It is true that
arms have been seized belonging to the State of
Georgia. The police of New York are not con-
trolled by the mayor of New York. Ifthey were
I would inflict upon the perpetrators of this out-
rage most summary punishment." There was
a man by the name of Jesse D. Bright; he was
and is not, and yet God did not take him. In
that respect there is a distinction between the case
of Jesse and Enoch. He gave one of his friends
a letter of introduction to Jeff. Davis on the sub-
ject of fire-arms. He wanted to put fire-arms into
tlu: hands of the rebels to assasssmate the Union.
So did tiiis man. They are two precious brothers
together—par nobile fratrum. Lovely in their
lives, m death they should not be divided. [Great
laughter.]
The gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Sciienck] told
us that the gentleman from New Yotk [Mr. Fer-
nando Wood] did make a patriotic speech in
New Yotk after the rebellion had btoken out, in
v Inch he declared his willingness to aid in putting
down this rebellion. The gentleman told us that
he sat beside him and heard him make the speech.
It has been said if he was unworthy to occupy
that stand tiie gentleman from Ohio ought not to
have sat there and heard the speech; tbat m doing
so he was particeps criminis. But I don't see how
that can be said when the speech being made was
patriotic and the thing was right. That I sup-
pose was one of the gentleman's [Mr. Fernando
Wood's] icpentant moments. He has had such
at long intervals and semi-occasionaiiy. I do not
know how to account for them.
Perhaps the gentleman from Ohio pursued the
right policy. Hamlet, when seeking to wreak his
vengeance upon tiie assassin of his father, unfor-
tunately found him at prayers, and would not kill
him then, because, as lie said, his soul might go
stiai ht to heaven when he wanted to send it to
hell. He said he would wait until he found him
drunk or in his adulterous bed, or engaged in
something that had no relish of salvation in it.
Then, said he, I'll
i;Tup him. that his heels nmy kick at heaven j
Ami th.it his soul may be as damned, and black,
A.s hell, wheieto it O'ois."
Hamlet waited h;s time, and the gentleman
from Ohio has hided his time, and now, with
amazing doXfeiity, tiips the gentleman, and
makys his heels fly in a direction antagonistic to
gsa vilation.
