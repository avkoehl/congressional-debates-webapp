THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

Mr. FLORENCE. I will merely say that this
subject has been investigated. It was investigated
by a committee of the Senate. It is absolutely
necessary, if this work is to be proceeded with,
that this bill should be passed. Its provisions
guard every interest very caiefully. My only ob-
jection to it is that it provides for a publication in
only one newspaper, instead of severai; but that
arises, probably, from my natural desire to give
patronage to the newspapers. I demand the pre-
vious question.
Mr. JOHN COCHRANE If the gentleman
will withdraw the demand for the previous ques-
tion for a moment, I will renew it.
Mr. FLORENCE. As this matter would be
likely to occupy some time, I will withdraw the
demand for the previous question, and move that
the bill be referred to the Committee for the Dis-
trict of Columbia; because, after an examination
before that committee, its importance will be made
more apparent to the House, and it may be passed
at any time in half an hour; and, inasmuch as the
bill is of great importance, I move that the com-
mittee have leave to report at any time.
Mr.SEWARD. Is that latter motion in order?
The SPEAKER. The Chair thinks not.
Mr. SEWARD. Then I object to it.
Mr. FLORENCE. Very well, then, let the bill
go to the committee unconditionally.
Mr. HOUSTON. I hope the gentleman from
Georgia will withdraw his objection, and allow
authority to be given to the committee to report
at any time. It is important that the bill should
pass speedily if it is to pass at all. The work is
now partially suspended, and will have to be en-
tirely suspended unless the bill is passed. There
can be no harm in authorizing the committee to
report at any time, and I hope thegentleman from
Georgia will withdraw his objection.
Mr. FLOR.ENCE. I suppose the Committee
for the District of Columbia will repoit it back
immediately, and the committees will probably
soon be called for reports. The work is already
partially suspended, and sympathy for those who
are thrown out of employment will, I am sure,
induce such a sympathizing set of gentlemen as
we have here to pass the bill independently of any
other consideration.
Mr. DAVIS, of Indiana. I object to this de-
bate.
Mr. SEWARD. "With my usual good nature,
I withdraw my objection. I am always over-
persuaded and sometimes do wrong. [Laughter.]
The previous question was seconded, and the
main question ordered; and, under the operation
thereof the bill was referred to the Committee for
the District of Columbia, and said committee was
authorized to report at any time.
Mr. FLORENCE moved to reconsider the vote
by which the bill was referred; and also moved
to lay the motion to reconsider on the table.
The latter motion was agreed to.

Mr. ROBBINS submitted the following resolu-
tion; which was read, considered, and agreed to:
Resolved, That the Committee of YVavs and Mentis be di-
rected to inquire into the propriety of raakiii" iin sppiopn-
ation lor the payment of the keepers of tin: lno-5>avu" s sta-

The SPEAKER also laid before the House a
communication from the Superintendent of Pub-
lic Printing, in answer to the resolution of the
House of the 16th of March, showing the aggre-
gate cost of tho public printing ordered by the
Thirty-Third and Thirty-Fourth Congresses;
which was laid upon the table, and ordered to be

authorize the holding of termsof the United States
district court for the northern district of the State 1
of Ohio at Toledo; which was read a first and

THE CENSUS OF K60.
Mr. WRIGHT, of Georgia. I desire to ask the*
unanimous consent of the House to offer resolu-
tions similar to the resolution which thegentleman
from Ohio [Mr. Sherman] asked for a suspension
of the rules to enable him to offer on Monday.
The House on that occasion refused to suspend
the rules by a small vote. I voted, however, for
the resolution of the gentleman from Ohio. It
was upon the subject of the appointment of a
committee to report to this House the best mode
of taking the next census. I think it is a useful
reso'ution, and it seems to be generally so re-
garded by the House.
Mr. BURNETT. These resolutions can only
bo introduced by unanimous consent.
Mr. WRIGHT, of Georgia. That is what I
am asking.
Mr. BURNETT. I object.
Mr. WRIGHT, of Georgia. I hope the gen-
tleman will allow the resolutions to be read. I
think he will then withdraw his objection.
Mr. BURNETT. I have no objection to their
being read; but I shall object to them.
The resolutions were read, as follows:
ReioM, That a committee of three be appointed by the
Spoakei, whose duty it shall lie to mquue into and report
by hill or otherwise, at as eaily a period as may be conve-
nient, to the next session of the present Congress, the be<Â±
mode of taking its ne\t census, so that it shall be national
in its character, and represent tanly and tiuly the progress
of our eountrv and of eveiy bcction.
Resolved, That said committee shall continue until such
report sluill be made, oi until otheiwise ordered by the
House.
Mr. BURNETT. I object to the resolutions.
CONNECTICUT RIVER.
Mr. ARNOLD submitted the following resolu-
tion; which was considered by unanimous con-
sent, and agreed to:
Resolved, That the Committee on Commerce is hereby
instructed to inquire into the necessity and expediency of
making an appropriation for the removal ot the obstructions
at the inoutb of the Connecticut river, and to report by bill
or otherwise.
PRIVILEGED QUESTION. I
Mr. IIASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to a priv- j
ileged question. I have for several days observed
men upon this floor who are not entitled to its :
privileges. I see one here now, who is a scrib-'
bier for the Herald, and who published in that!
paper that I had gone over to the Black Republi-
cans, and was with Mattesox and the lobby.
He is a thief of character of the name of Shaw.
I move that the Doorkeeper shall show him the
door, and that the Speaker shall particularly di-
rect the attention of the Doorkeeper to the 17th
rule, defining who is and who is not entitled to
the privileges of this floor.
The SPEAKER. So far as the latter part of the
gentleman's remarks are concerned, it is wholly
unnecessary, for the Chair has repeatedly called
the attention of the Doorkeeper to the rule.
Mr. HASKIN. I have called the attention of
the House to this matter because I have seen men
here who were not entitled to the privileges of the
floor. As this is an important day in tiie history
of the country, I hope that the Doorkeeper will
be compelled to enforce the 17th rule.
The SPEAKER. The Doorkeeper will see
that the rule is enforced.

Mr. WASHBURN, of Maine. I ask the unan-
imous consent of the House for leave to introduce
a bill to authorize and facilitate the construction
of a northern and a southern and a central Pa-
cific railroad, and for other purposes.
Mr. KE1TT objected, but subsequently with-
drew the objection.
Mr. CLEMENS renewed the objection.
ADMISSION OF KANSAS.
Mr. STEPHENS, of Georgia. Mr. Speaker,
the hour of one having arrived, I move, in pur-
suance of notice, to take up the Senate bill for the
admission of Kansas.
* The bill was read a first time by its title; as
follows:
An act for the admission of the State of Kansas
into the Union.
Mr. GIDDINGS. I object to the bill.
The SPEAKER. The gentleman from Ohio
making objection to the bill, under the llGthrule,
the question propounded to the House will first
be, " Shall this bill be rejected!"
Mr. STEPHENS, of Georgia, demanded the
yeas and nays.
The yeas and nays were ordered.

ing of the bill.
