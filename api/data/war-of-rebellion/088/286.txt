Major-General BUTLER:

Lieutenant-General Grant desires that you have the spare pontoon bridge, now at Deep Bottom, thrown across the river near the lower pontoon bridge so as to have ;two bridges with the best approaches that can be got for Hancock's use by dark to-night.

HEADQUARTERS,August 18, 1864.

Lieutenant General U. S. GRANT,

Commanding, &amp;c., City Point:

We are garrisoning Fort Powhatan and Forton Pocahontas (Wilson's Landing) with 100-day's men, whose time is now quite out. We want two regiments for that purpose. There must be now a large surplus of new regiments of 100-days's men and others in and about Washington and Baltimore. Can we not have some of these men, 100-days' regiments, ordered down? It will not do to lose either of these points.

It would shut us off from the river.

BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Major-General.

CITY POINT, VA., August 18, 1864.

Major-General BUTLER,

Commanding, &c.:

Wilcox's wharf and Fort Powhatan must be held. No troops, however, can be had from Washington or Baltimore. They are calling on me for troops to take the place of those now there soon to be discharged. You will have to send some of your colored troops.
