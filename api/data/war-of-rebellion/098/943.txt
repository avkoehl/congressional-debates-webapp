dark, the connection with General Palmer's left not being perfect, the One hundred and seventy-fourth Ohio Volunteers reported to me and built works in reserve for support of right flank, but in three hours were ordered by me to report to Colonel Thomas. On the 9th advanced our skirmish line 300 yards and found the enemy's pickets; built barricades on the skirmish line; strengthened main line of works; placed a strong palisade along entire front. Occasional sharpshooting was kept up until 4 p.m., when the enemy made a strong but unsuccessful attack upon our line; sharp skirmishing continued until after dark. At midnight of the 9th the One hundred and eightieth Ohio Volunteers were ordered to report to General T. H. Ruger, and were sent by him to extend and strengthen General Carter's left, their company of skirmishers still remaining in front of my brigade.

On the 10th instant, at 11 a.m., Colonel McQuiston's brigade moved out, and I was ordered to extend my lines so as to occupy my own works and those vacated by Second Brigade, which I did without a moment's delay, the three regiments in the same order as before. At 12 m. the enemy advanced on our whole front in line of battle, driving our skirmishers before them. When within 100 yards of my works my whole line opened upon them, and after a moment's struggle their line was broken and they fell back in disorder, whereupon we pursued them with a strong skirmish line, taking 1 lieutenant and 34 enlisted men prisoners within 100 yards of our works. By steadily pushing forward, with sharp skirmishing, we at length retook our original line of skirmish pits, and soon after dark firing ceased. Just as the enemy were repulsed the Twenty-eighth Michigan Volunteers and One hundred and thirtieth Indiana Volunteers reported to me and were assigned to position along the main line. Soon afterward the Ninth New Jersey Volunteers and one section of Elgin Battery reported to me and were ordered by me to strengthen the main line. The two guns being placed in position on the right rendered important service by shelling the woods and enabling my skirmishers to advance. At 4 p.m. the One hundred and twenty-ninth Indiana Volunteers reported to me and relieved the Ninth New Jersey Volunteers. At dusk the One hundred and twenty-ninth and One hundred and thirtieth Indiana Volunteers and Twenty-eighth Michigan Volunteers were ordered by me to report to Colonel McQuiston. During the time the One hundred and eightieth Ohio Volunteers were detached from the brigade they were engaged in severe skirmishing on the left and captured 31 prisoners, making total number taken by brigade 1 lieutenant and 65 enlisted men. The number [killed and] wounded in my brigade during the three days' engagements is as follows:
