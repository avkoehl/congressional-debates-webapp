Respectfully referred with inclosure to the commanding general.

Major-General.

[Second indorsement.]

It must be first ascertained if the persons referred to by the enemy were in the military service of the Confederacy. General Ruggles ought to be extremely careful not to allow the enemy to use the flag of truce as a pretext for making reconnaissance, a fixed point down the river being fixed upon for exchange of flags.
