of the Union under our tariff laws relating to
cottons and woolens.
[Here the hammer fell.]
The CHAIRMAN. The gentleman from
Oregon [Mr. Slater] is entitled to the floor.
Mr. SLATER. I yield a portion of my time
to the gentleman from Illinois, [Mr. Bdrch-
am>.]
Mr. KELLEY. While I supposed the gen-
tleman from Illinois [Mr. Burchard] was lim-
ited to his hour, I did not like to interfere
with him. I wish to take the liberty now of
saying to him—referring to a matter he alluded
to some time ago—that instead of Pennsylvania
exporting grain in competition with the West,
the Lehigh valley alone for the last ten years
has required annually from six to ten million
bushels of wheat for her iron-workers brought
from the fields of the West.
Mr. KERR. And it pays less for that wheat
to-day than it did in 1860.
Mr. KELLEY. The gentleman from Illi-
nois can get on without the aid of the gentle-
man from Indiana, [Mr. Kerr.]
Mr. KERR. So he can without the aid of
the gentleman from Pennsylvania.
Mr. BURCHARD. The table I have sub-
mitted is prepared from the reports made by
the Department of Agriculture. It furnishes
a statement of the production in 1870 of every
State in this Union. Pennsylvania produced
over seventeen million bushels of wheat, as
the table will show. The aggregate produc
tion of the United States was two hundred
and thirty-five million bushels. Subtractfrom
that the grain exported abroad, and used for
seed, and you have the amount consumed in
this country for food. Divide that by the pop-
ulation, and you have thp per capita consump
tion of every man, woman, and child. Penn-
sylvania, unless she consumes more bread-
stuffs than the other States did, was unable to
consume all that her own farmers produced,
and left a surplus in that year according to
these tables of eight hundred, and eighty thou-
sand bushels, which she sent into competition
with the grain of the West.
Mr. KELLEY. I speak from no tabulated
statements of officers. I speak upon no theory.
I speak from a knowledge of the fact when I
say that there are consumed annually in the
Lehigh valley alone more than six million
bushels of western grain. And I add that in
Johnstown, Pennsylvania, at the western base
of the Alleghany mountains, more western
gram has been consumed year by year for the
last ten years than is consumed in the city of
London with its three million population.
Mr. BURCHARD. It is possible that grain
grown in the West may be consumed in the
Lehigh valley and elsewhere, that western
Pennsylvania may buy some of our grain
moving eastward while eastern Pennsylvania
ships some of her wheat to go abroad. But it
is the fact that the State of Pennsylvania,
according to official figures, produced more
wheat than her pro rata consumption, and
that she had a surplus to export from her own
borders to supply New England, New York,
or foreign countries.
Mr. KELLEY. The gentleman's calculation
is based on the theory that the freedmen and
other non- wheat-consuming people of the
South, who live on Indian corn, consume as
much wheat per capita as the well-paid labor-
ers of Pennsylvania. Take the non-wheat-
consuming population of the South from your
divisor, and then see where the consumption
of wheat of Pennsylvania will stand in com-
parison with her production.
Mr. BURCHARD. Well, reduce the amount
consumed in the South, and increase the
amount consumed in the northwestern States,
where it is abundant, and you still see that in
Pennsylvania the consumption above the pro-
duction must be very insignificant. New Eng-
land produces less grain than she consumes,
and the products of her farms are consumed
at home.
Mr. KELLEY. The gentleman cannot
cipher down the facts of the daily life of apeo-
ple numbering three millions by any sum the
elements of which he cannot give and no man
can ascertain.
Mr. BURCHARD. I have prepared a table
showing the consumption and production of
woolens and cottons in the States I have enum-
erated. It will be for the gentleman to ex-
plain the facts and figures. The estimates
and statistics are furnished by men who are not
interested in misrepresenting or overstating
the amount. I take their figures and I give to
each man the per capita consumption through-
out the Union. Doubtless we in the Northwest,
in a colder region of country, consume much
more largely of woolens, and therefore a higher
tax is imposed upon us. Cotton goods are
consumed in the southern States, but these
figures will show that the bounty received by
the New England States on woolen goods is
$16,000,000, and on cotton goods $35,000,000,
making $51,000,000; by the middle States
$1,000,000 on woolens; in the border States,
a large deficiency of consumption over pro-
duction :

Mr. HOAR. I desire to ask the gentleman
if he is not aware that more than two fifths of
the woolen industry in this country has grown
up in the northwestern States since the war,
and why does he leave that out of his com-
putation?
Mr. BURCHARD. It is not true that two
fifths of the woolen industry has grown up in
the West. It is true that more than three
fourths of the woolen bounties are received in
New England, as this table will show. The
border States pay of this bounty to New Eng-
land $3,500,000 and $7,000,000 on cottons,
making $10,500,000. The northwestern States
pay $5,000,000 on woolens and $14,500,000
on cottons, making nearly $20,000,000. The
cotton States pay $7,000,000 on woolens and
$7,000,000 on cotton, making $14,000,000.
The Pacific States pay $950,000 on woolens
and $1,244,000 on cottons, making over two
million dollars.
Pennsylvania statesmen are concerned for
the poor laborers. Why tax the laborers and
producers of other regions and States? Why
should Ohio farmers pay bounties to keep Con-
necticut mechanics from pauperism?
EFFECTS OF TARIFF.
For the benefit of mining and manufacturing
regions it taxes the rest of the country. It.
accumulates wealth in the former at the expense
of the latter.
The census returns of 1870 make some start-
ling revelations, among them none more strik-
ing than the following:
