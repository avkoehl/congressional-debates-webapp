Division commanders will use every exertion to rest their troops during the halt at this point. This can be done by the erection of shelter-tents, bough-houses, digging of wells, and keeping out alarm posts between the pickets and the rifle-pits. Sinks will, of course, be constructed and every exertion made to reorganize the command and enforce discipline and good order.

GENERAL: The major-general commanding directs me to say that he has ordered General Gibbon to fall back from his advanced line to the main line occupied by him.

You will please leave your picket-line in these rifle-pits, or your supports if the picket-line is beyond them. The general desires this done in anticipation of being called upon for support by General Wright.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,
