I was informed, counted the wagons when parked at night, while Captain Summers caused them to be carefully counted in the daytime when on the march. I have no doubt that the number he gives is correct.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

DANL. DUSTIN,

Colonel, Commanding DIVISION.

QMRS. DEPT., THIRD Brigadier, SECOND DIV., 20TH A. C.,

Atlanta, Ga., October 24, 1864.

Captain H. M. WHITTELSEY,

Acting Chief Quartermaster, Twentieth Army Corps:

SIR: As quartermaster in charge of the recent foraging expedition I have the honor respectfully to make the following report:

The train started from Atlanta on the morning of the 21st in considerable confusion, owing to the illness and absence of Captain Lacey, who had been selected to take charge of the train, and as I was unexpectedly called upon to fill his place I could do no better than to take such general instructions and lists of wagons as were furnished to him and push forward the train, expecting to halt a few miles out of town, and, if possible, perfect an organization. About one mile beyond Decatur, Colonel Dustin, in command of the expedition, halted, and an attempt was made to organize the train, but it was discovered that the number of wagons was so great and the confusion was so complete that the attempt to organize was abandoned until the halt for the night, and on the appearance of the cavalry command the expedition moved forward to its destination. On the same evening the train was parked and the organization again attempted. On the examination of lists, p that the following list of the wagons and officers present is as perfect as could be made:
