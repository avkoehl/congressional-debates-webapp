FORT MONROE, VA., May 19, 1863.

Honorable EDWIN M. STANTON, Secretary of War.

Will you please direct that all prisoners be paroled before leaving their places of detention and especially before embarking on any transport. Unless done in this latter case there is great danger that they may overpower the guard and run away with the vessel. I have had intimations of such intentions. Two transports left last night to bring away prisoners from Fort Delaware.

WM. H. LUDLOW,

Lieutenant-Colonel, &amp;c.

[Indorsement.]

Referred to the General-in-Chief to issue the necessary orders.

EDWIN M. STANTON.
