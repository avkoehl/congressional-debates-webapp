Policy of the Government—Mr. Bell.
Ho. of Reps.
or to criticise too closely a paper which, like I
mam of the same kind, have often to be drawn ]l
up without afloiding time for close or accurate
uviMon but it is minifest that this document
w is uittniltd and expected to pioduce results of
the gieattst impoitanc" to the country It was
dou itkss uittniltd to piepaie and reconcile the
public mmd to the change of polity by the pai ty
m povvti, ind to give populmtyto tht projtctof
expend nig tht suiplus levt ime upon such objects
as would raiM us to the fhst rink among nations
in militnv and naval powei I lcgaid it as, theie-
tore, t litn11> propt r to point out any inconsist-
ency wliuh maj impau the effect of it It would
be idle to vote a hundit d millions to the public
dt It nst ot the country if it be true that, by leason
ofthe nituieofoui Government, it is impossible
that the country can evei be put into a condition
to meet the emergency of sudden wai
Mr Chairman, I regard the time as particularly
propitious to a general re\ lew of the conduct and
principles of men in power, especially in lefcience
to the public defenses The Fiench question is
at an end, and we c in now inquire into the con-
duct of the public officers who aie responsible for
them, and hold them up naked to the woild, with-
out the risk of exposing ourweakness to the pub-
lic enemy A time of peace, too, it is said is the
time to prepaie for war This is the srre-U maxim
upon which the new policy of the Administiation
is txptcted to be suppoited V true and wise
maxim it is, but one which is only half under-
stood by those in whose mouths we most fie-
quentlv find it Many suppose that the only
prepirttion for wir consists in increasing our
mihtaiy and n ival establishments
The great minister of Henry the IV of France,
who wis sumamed The Gieu, understood the
full impoit of this maxim The bi st, the truest,
and most effective pieparation for wai, is to take
care that all the impoitant depaitments of the |
civil administiation aie in a sound and healthful
condition, especially those connected with the
fiscal resources of the country, and those which
aie the keys to public confidence It those be
disoidertd and disananged when entenng upon
a war, there can be no hope of a successful and
economical management of the public credit and
resources, or, in other words, of the sinews of
w^r—tlieie can be no reform in time of war
Public confidence is as essential to the support
of war as money itself. In truth it is confidence
which supplies money It you mean, then,
really to enter upon a system of defense and
effective pieparation for war, begin at the right
point. Correct the abuses in your civil admmis-
truion—regulate and discipline your household
tioops When you havedone this,and not befoie,
miv you feel secure of the faithful and skillful
application of the public treasure to the public
defense, and when war shall actually come, suc-
cess and victory cannot fail to crown your arms
But there is a strongei justification than any I
have yet mentioned of the course of discussion
and scrutiny which I propose. It is that no time
is to be lost in calling the attention of the public
to, and exposing, some late practices of the party
m piwer, practices which are of the mjst mis-
chievous and alarming tendency. We have too
long slept upon this subject Every moment of
silent acquiescence here tends to giv e cui rency and
support to these dangerous innovations, in the
minds ofthe people If there was but one voice to
be lifted up in this House against the late conduct
of the party, it ought to be instantly and boldly
uttered Besides the direct int( rference of public
officers of the highest grade, in the elections of
members to both Houses of Congress, is not the
Executive Chief Magistrate engaged in the can-
vass, the open advocate and champion of the elec-
tion ofthe Vice Presiden t to the Presidency ' Have
we not, in fact, a Government candidate for the
Presidency, supported by the whole power and
influence of the Executive' Are not the whole
train of public officers, with all their dependants
in the field, in full cry, barking away, and hunt-
ing down every man who dares to inteipose his
influence agamst the consummation of their plans'
I here in my place declare there is such a candi-
date, who, should he be elected, may be said to
have succeeded to the Presidency, as truly and
manifestly through the powei and influence of
the Government, as though Up had been appointed
to the succession, and actually installed in office '
by his predecessor I do not say that eveiy in-
dividual in office is giving himself up to this sei-
vice, I know there are man v honorable exceptions,
but as a class, a corps, what I have sud ofthe
public office is I reaffirm Sir, how long is this
state of things to continue before any solemn
opinion shall be expressed by this House in re-
gaid to it? This interference of the Government
in the election of a successor has been open and
notorious for the last nine or twelve months A
session of Congress, in the meantime, has inter-
vened More than three months have elapsed
since its commencement, and yet no resolution
has been offered—no notice of any kind taken of
so extiaoidinary a state of things We have, too,
a House of Representatives, in which there aie
said to be one hundred and forty membeis who
piofcss to be Republicans, the disciples and fol-
lowers of JefFt rson, and not one of them has lifted
up his voice here to denounce a piactice so danger-
ous and destiuctive of the constitutional guaran-
tees of oui liberties
How are we to account foi this silence' Is it
agreed by the paity that there is no method of
peipetuatmg their power but by a regulai line of
succession ' Is this silence the result of a delib-
erate judgment in favor ofthe practice of employ-
ing the patronage and influence ofthe Executive
in behall of the regularly nominated candidate'
Sn, I hope for the safety of the countiy that it
is not But I have lately witnessed the rapid
progress of error on this subject, not only in the
minds of individuals, but of a whole community,
and it is melancholy to leflect how sudden and
pn cipitate may be tht overthrow of all those pun-
ciples and mixims which have heretofoie been
legalded as fundainentil and essential lo the very
existence of the institutions and the public liberty
When the fiist evidi nee was givi n to the public
of adnect interference of the Executive in the
election of his successor, scarcely an individual
of the party would be heard to defend it. But in
a few short months every supporter of the Vice
Piesident in that community was ready to attest
his sanction ofthe practice as just and expedient
under his hand and seal, if necessary It is time
to oppose ouiselves to this erroi if we would save
the Constitution
Mr Chanman, I have spoken with gieat free-
dom of the couiseof the paity in power, and I
have not spaied my cuisure when I thought it
wasdeseivid I intend to continue to exeicise
this privilege, in the course of tht lemirks I yet
propose to submit But it is due to myself,
standing in the delicate and difficult relation I now
do towards the paity, that I should distinctly de-
clare the natuie of that relation I have, up to a
late penod, given a geneial suppoit to the present
administration of the Government I still con-
sider myself a supporter of the Administration,
upon every leading and impoitant question which
has arisen, to the same extent to which I foi merly
gave them my support, except those which ori-
ginated in, or have been changed and modified
by, the illegitimate desire and purpose of the
Executive to secure the election of a particular
and favorite successoi As to all the principles
and practices which have proceeded from this
source, I am, I have been, and I am fiimly re-
solved still to be opposed If any membei of
this House can claim the indulgence of the com-
mittee in commenting freely upon the present
I state of public affairs, and especially upon the
practices and objects of those in power, when it
is remembered by whom, and in what manner, I
have been assailed, I think I may do so It is
not only due to myself, but it is due to the few
friends with whom I act in this House. It is
equally due to the public I owe it to many of
those ofthe Jackson party who have united their
interests and influence with the party which is
attempting to bring in the Vice President, and
whom I hope I may still claim as my personal
fnends, to vindicate the principles which have
impelled me to my late course. It has been said
that I have abandoned the party to which I once
belonged I deny that the party now in power
is, properly speaking, and if principle be the test
of party, the same with which I once acted But,
sn, if this be the party of which I was once a
member, I am fiee to admit, and I am ready to
demonstrate to them, and ihe woild, tint either
I or thev have proved iccrcant and faith! «s to
every caidinal pi inciple and poli ileal \ n tue w Inch
they once piofessed and avowed as the uilfs of
their conduct I proceed now to the | roofs, and
I shall, whin I have airivtd them, most cheer-
fully submit tr the decision of the pi blic upon
the question whether 1 or the paity aie the cul-
pi its

The Navy bill being again taken up,
Mr BELL said At the close of my remarks
on yesteiday, I was claiming the pnvilege of vin-
dicating the course of myself and the fewfnends
with whom I acted in this House. I said they
weie few in number—they are so, for the sake
ofthe countiy I wish the number greater, but for
the honoi of the enterprise I would not wish to
add a unit to it I know, too, the exact extent
of the sympathies and good wishes ol those who
constitute the larser proportion of the Opposition
in this House, to the party of the succession
which we enjoy But I am content to receive
their countenance, however limited it may be
Air Chairman, some of those with whom I
formerly acted in this House, did not think my
declaration upon the natuie of my present rela-
tions to the party in power sufficiently explicit.
I can have no possible motive to assume an equiv-
ocxl position, either before the committee or the
country On the contraiy, I consider my honor
at stake in taking a diffeient course I therefoie
repeat, that I shall support all the measures of
this Administration which I shall find to be in
accordance with its eaily avowed pnnciples, in
the same manner and to the same extent I have
hitheito done, and I shall oppose with all my in-
fluence and ability, whatever they may be worth,
every measure, every practice and movement of
the party which can be tiaced to the policy or
motive of electing the executive favorite to the
succession If the declaiation that I hold myself
still the suppoiter of the Administration, to any
extent, shall appear inconsistent with my votes
upon so manv party questions which arise in this
House fiom day to day, I can only answei that
it is not my fault if the party action of this House
shall, in almost every instance, have a dnect
reference, not so much to the suppoit of General
Jackson, as the election of a paiticular candidate
to the Presidency.
1 now pioceed to notice briefly those leading
and prominent principles and professions of the
original Jackson party which those who now
claim to be identical with that party have aban-
doned and disregarded in piactice
The original supporters of General Jackson
advocated his election against Mr. Crawford, the
candidate nominated according to party usage,
upon the ground that the practice of caucus nom-
inations of a Piesident of the United States was
a violation ofthe spirit of the Constitution, as it
tended to defeat the contingent light ofthe small
States to have an equal vote in the election of that
high officer, as often as the election mightdevolve
upon the House of Representatives They also
objected to such nominations because they were
effected by intugueand conupt influences, and
upon the further ground, that it tended to defeat
the free and independent voice of the people. All
the objections to a nomination by a congiessional
caucus apply with still greater force to a nom-
ination by a convention of pretended delegates
from the people, such as we have lately seen at
Baltimore In the first canvass of General Jack-
son this was, in a very large section of the Union,
decidedly the most popular and available argu-
ment against the candidate who had the advant-
age of a nomination by the Republican party.
But now, sir, no man is admitted tobe a Jackson
man, or a supporter of his Administration, who
refuses to admit the practice of caucus nomina-
tions to be orthodox, and to subscribe to the obli-
gation of acquiescence and absolute obedience.
It is worthy of notice, that the very individual
(Mr. Grundy) who, in the State which 1 have
the honor to repiesent in part was the most active
