WASHINGTON, D. C., August 27, 1862-1.50 p.m.

Major-General McCLELLAN,

Alexandria, Va.:

Yes, I think Sumner's corps should come to Alexandria.* The enemy has appeared at Leesburg, and the commanding officer at Edwards Ferry asked for cavalry. Have you any to spare him? The enemy seem to be trying to turn Pope's right. Is there no way of communicating with him?

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.

ALEXANDRIA, VA., August 27, 1862-2.30 p.m.

Major-General HALLECK,

Commanding U. S. Army:

Do you wish to the order sending 5,000 new troops to Yorktown countermanded? If they can be sent I can withdraw nearly twice that number of old troops from that place. The transportation is ready for these troops. If you can give me 5,000 more I can withdraw the whole of Keyes' corps.

I consider it important that the troops should embark at once.

GEO. B. McCLELLAN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,Alexandria, Va., August 27, 1862-2.40 p.m.

Major-General HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

Have you received my messages of 1.15 and 1.35 p.m.? I am waiting here at your request.

GEO. B. McCLELLAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

WASHINGTON, D. C., August 27, 1862.

Major-General McCLELLAN,

Alexandria, Va.:

I have already advised you to bring up Sumner's corps. Perhaps we may also bring up Burnside's, if deemed necessary. General Barnard has all the troops he asked for at the forts, but I can give you no details. I have sent for him to consult with you; nor do I know about the Bull Run Bridge. From your knowledge of the whole country about here you can best act. I have had no time to obtain such knowledge.

There is no cavalry here, or, rather, only part of a small battalion. One company has been sent to scout up the river toward Edwards Ferry. It is very likely to be cut off.

As you must be aware, more than three-quarters of my time is taken up with the raising of new troops and matters in the West. I have no time for details. You will therefore, as ranking general in the field, direct as you deem best; but at present orders for Pope's army should go through me.

Gunboats are at Aquia Creek.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.
