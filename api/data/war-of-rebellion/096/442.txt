A small party, under command of Lieutenant-Colonel Whitaker, sent out by General Merritt to break up Harry Gilmor's band, at a point south of Moorefield, was quite successful. Major Young, of my staff, and chief of scouts, captured Harry Gilmor and brought him in.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

I would respectfully ask permission to send Major Harry Gilmor to either Fort Lafayette or Fort Warren for confinement. He is an energetic, shrewd, and unscrupulous scoundrel and a dangerous man. He must be closely watched, or he will escape.
