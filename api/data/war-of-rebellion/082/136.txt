left brigade of my advance line. The fire was opened by the enemy's pickets and replied to by about fifty shots from mine, after which the line was again quiet as before. No loss occurred on our side. Occasional shots were fired from the enemy's battery opposite the right of our line, seemingly directed to the fortifications near the First Division. Some two or three were thrown to my left toward the Second Corps from a battery on the enemy's right.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. W. CRAWFORD,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS THIRD DIVISION, FIFTH ARMY CORPS,July 10, 1864-2.30 p.m.

General WARREN:

General Hancock desires that I should move to the left and occupy about 400 yards of the line now held by Birney. I can do this if you approve and would recommend it, as otherwise I may be called upon to send my reserve brigade to the extreme left, the whole of the Second Corps being in line at present.

Respectfully,

S. W. CRAWFORD,

Brigadier-General.

General CRAWFORD:

The major-general commanding authorizes you to move up on the line now occupied by General Birney, as you propose.

FRED. T. LOCKE,
