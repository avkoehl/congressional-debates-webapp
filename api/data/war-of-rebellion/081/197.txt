Major-General BUTLER,

Commanding,&amp;c.:

Your dispatch just received. As you were unable to make the attack at the time first ordered, you will suspend the attack you have ordered to be made between this and daylight, but hold all your troops in readiness to take advantage of any weakening of the enemy in your front, that may be caused by their withdrawal of troops to re-enforce Petersburg against an attack that will be made by Meade in the morning.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

Major-General BUTLER,

Commanding,&c.:

Send two of the enemy gun-boats, if they can be spared, and one if two cannot go, up the Pamunkey to White House, to remain and guard the river from West Point up until the garrison is removed. A small garrison was left at White House to cover the return of Sheridan and Hunter and to hold the railroad bridge for them to cross over.
