RICHMOND, VA., November 8, 1862.

Lieutenant Colonel CHARLES LAFFON DE LADIBAT, Richmond, Va.

SIR: I have received the petition of the French Legion of New Orleans of which you were bearer and would be greatly gratified to aid in the liberation of the Honorable Pierre Soule, now confined in close prison by the United States Government in violation of the usages of civilized warfare. I know of no method, however, in which I can assist you in the mission you have assumed. I hope it will be successful; but if not please convey to the officers of the Legion the assurance that Mr. Soule's captivity in common with that of many others of our citizens now confined in Northern prisons is a constant subject of solicitude to this Government and that no proper efforts will be spared to secure his release.

Very respectfully, yours, &amp;c.,

JEFFERSON DAVIS.
