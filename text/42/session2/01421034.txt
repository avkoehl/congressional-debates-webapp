Mr. SCOTT. I present a petition very
largely signed by citizens of Philadelphia,
representing that they are largely interested as
property-owners and otherwise in the com-
merce of that port; that for many years past
all persons having occasion to transact busi-
ness on the river Schuylkill in that city have
been seriously embarrassed by street bridges
erected across such stream- in sueh a manner
as materially and unnecessarily to injure the
navigation of the river; that they, as well as
citizens of other States and foreign merchants,
have been much injured and damaged by the
absence of a proper survey of that river and
by the existence of obstructions which could
be easily removed. They then give statistics
at considerable length with reference to the
business done upon that river, and pray that
this petition may be referred to the proper
committee, and that, after full examination
and report, such measures may be adopted as
will secure the free navigation of the river.
I move the reference of this petition to the
Committee on Commerce.
The motion w&3 agreed to.
