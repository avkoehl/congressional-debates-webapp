HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,September 7, 1864.

General WILLIAMS:

Since last report the line from Williams' house to Norfolk road has been about completed. The troops are now engaged in finishing and particularly in slashing. The right of my two divisions on that line now rests on the plank road.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,September 7, 1864. (Sent 11 a. m.)

Commanding Second Corps:

The major-general commanding directs that as soon as the part of the rear line upon which working parties of the Second Corps have been engaged admits of it, one of the divisions will be returned to the vicinity of the Jones house.

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,September 7, 1864-11.45 a. m.

Major-General HANCOCK,

Commanding Second Corps:

An examination of the Blackwater Swamp yesterday show s it to be impassable below where the left of the rear inc of intrenchments rests, except at a point about one-third of a mile below the left of the rifle-pits, where it is passable for horsemen, and may be made passable for artillery. The point is indicated on the maps by a road which is not drawn through the swamp. The rifle-pit should be extended to include this point. The dam at Sturdivant's Mill should be rebuilt as soon as a working party can be sent there; it will make the low ground of second swamp impassable.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,September 7, 1864-10.45 p. m.

Major-General HANCOCK,

Commanding Second Corps:

I am instructed to ask whether in your judgment it would not be well to move a brigade at daylight to the Deserted House to re-enforce Mott if necessary and another brigade to the vicinity of the Jones house to re-enforce on the plank road if required, the brigades to come from the two divisions working on the rear line.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
