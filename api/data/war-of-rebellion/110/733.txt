Assistant Adjutant-General:

CAPTAIN: I am afraid it will be impossible to get my command across without building a bridge, and as I have no axes or spades it would take me allmorning and night to make it. I think it better to go to Glass', where I can get corn to-night, and move up to the Fairburn road to-morrow. I have directed General Ross, who is now west of Flint River, to move to where the Atlanta and Fayetteville road crosses the Jonesborough and Fairburn road at once, and scout and picket in direction of East Point.

F. C. ARMSTRONG,

Brigadier-General.

My headquarters to-night will be near Glass' Mills.
