SURRENDER OP PROPERTY OP PRERDKEIT—VIOLATION
OP LAWS.
During the rebellion four million slaves
became free. The military authorities took
possession of millions of acres of lands aban-
doned by their owners, and acquired the title
to still more by confiscation and purchase at
tax sales under the direct tax law. (Act July
16, 1866 ; 14 United States Statutes, 17G, sec-
tion 12; 12 Statutes, 319,549; and by succes-
sion or capture to lands owned by the rebel gov-
ernment-, Evidence, 551, 663 ; Act February 6,
1863; 12 Statutes, 640; Act July 16, 1866,
section 6;'14 Statutes, 174; confiscation act
July 17,1862; 12 Statutes, 592; Evidence, 90,
95.) The Freedmen's Bureau act of March 3,
1865, set apart in tracts of forty acres for the
use of loyal refugees and freedmen lands in
possession of or owned by the Government to
be enjoyed for three years on rent with a right
of purchase thereafter. (13 Statutes, 507, Act
July 2, 1864; Evidence, 90, 95.)
In many cases lands were '' condemned'' and
thereby " became the property of the United
States '' prior and preparatory to a sale under
the confiscation laws. (12 Statutes, 592, sec-
tion 7; Act July 17, 1862; Evidence, 90.)
These and other lands owned by the Govern-
ment were claimed by circular No. 13, of July
28, 1865, of General Howard, Commissioner
of the Freedmen's Bureau, for lease and sale to
freedmen and refugees. ^House Executive
Document 11, first session Thirty-Ninth Con-
gress ; House Executive Document 120, first
session Thirty-Ninth Congress; Evidence, 120,
88; Attorney General Speed's Opinions, June
22, September 14, 1865; Evidence, 791, 812.)
General Howard insisted that the President's
pardon to rebels did not restore lands set apart
for freedmen by law, nor apply to lands after
a decree of condemnation or confiscation. (Acts
March 3, 1865, and July 2, 1864, first session,
chapter 225; House Executive Document
II, first session Thirty-Ninth Congress; Evi-
dence, 88, 90, 97.) The President, however,
determined and directed a circular to issue
declaring that a pardon by special warrant or
the amnesty of May 29, 1865, restored lands
set apart to freedmen and lands " condemned "
but not sold. (House Executive Document
llr first session Thirty-Ninth Congress, Evi-
dence, 88; order August 16, 1865 ; Evidence,
124.) This was a palpable violation of the
law declaring the freedmen should be pro-
tected in possession and of the confiscation law
vesting title in the Government by decree of
condemnation. (Act March 3, 1865, section
four; 13 Statutes, 608; Evidence, 791, 795;
volume seven, History of the Republic of the
United States, pages 585-87, by John C. Hamil-
ton.) It was against the protest of General
Howard; was done without the advice of the
Attorney General, and against his judgment
(Evidence, 88, 90, 99, 791.) By the Presi-
dent's authority real and personal property of
the value of many millions were thus surren-
dered in violation of law and of the rights of
refugees, freedmen, and of the Government
itself. (Evidence, 124, 88, 97, 99, 100, 104,
III, 128 j House Executive Document 99,
first session Thirty-Ninth Congress.) The
Sea islands, seized under General Sherman's
famous special field order, and to which the
circulars did not apply, were surrendered and
the freedmen thereon settled were deprived of
their rights. (Evidence, 111, 112, 116.)
And it would seem from the evidence that
finally large amounts of land actually confis-
cated were surrendered in violation of law to
rebels. (Evidence, 761, 1086.) The extent to
which these violations of law proceeded may
be imagined by the amnesty and pardon granted
to rebels. (House Executive Document 99,
first session Thirty-Ninth Congress; House
Executive Document 31 and 116, second
session Thirty-Ninth Congress; Evidence, 8,
53, 276, 465, 593; Amnesty Proclamation May
29, 1865.)
ABUSE OF THE VETO POWER.
The President may lawfully exercise the veto
power, and yet if he exercise it from corrupt
motives or for corrupt purposes it is a high
misdemeanor. (3 Benton's Abridgement of
Debates of Congress, 274.)
It is almost impossible to read the evidence
and official documents in relation to the veto
of the bill for the admission of Colorado into
the Union on the 12th January, 1866, without
finding the conclusion irresistablethat the Pres-
ident attempted to bribe to the support of his
policy the Senators-elect from that new State
as a condition of his approval of the bill, and
failing in that, refused it his sanction against his
convictions of duty and after he had'' expressed
himself in favor" of the admission of the pro-
posed State into the Union. (Act of Congress,
March 21, 1864; Senate Executive Document
10, first session Thirty-Ninth Congress; vol-
ume 69 Congressional Globe, parti,for 1865-66,
page 210; Evidence, 20, 23, 979, 641, 618.)
His other vetoes were scarcely less unjustifi-
ably employed to accomplish the usurpations
of which he is guilty.
ABUSE OF THE APPOINTING POWER.
The appointment of provisional governors
is among the most palpaole of his usurpations
having no color of law to authorize it. (Senate
Executive Document 26, first session Thirty-
Ninth Congress; volume 69 Globe, June 1862,
pages 2477, 2596; 12 Statutes 646, 502, sec-
tion two; Acts February 9, 1863, and July 2,
1862; Evidence, 35, 40.)
His attempt to control the "general order"
business to reward favorites in disregard of his
duties to recommend measures to relieve com-
merce of unnecessary burdens is scarcely less
reprehensible. (9 Statutes, 53 ; Act 6, August
1846, section 1; Act March 1, 1823; section
3, House Reports 30, second session Thirty-
Ninth CoDgress, 78, 81; Evidence, 15.)
His abuse of the power of removal from and
appointments to office is unparalleled in our
history. (Senate Executive Document38, first
session Tkirty-Nintf| Congress; also second
session Thirty-Ninth Congress Senate Execu-
tive Documents 14 and 32; House Executive
Documents 67 and 96: House fieport 30,
second session Thirty-Ninth Congress, pages
78, 93; Evidence, 333, 384.)
His refusal to send to the Senate for con-
firmation or rejection the names of persons
appointed to office, and his reappointment of
others after rejection by the Senate are grave
indignities at least. (Documents, second ses-
sion Thirty-Ninth Congress, House Executive
Document 67, pages 9, 12, 13, 20, 22; House
Executive Document 96; Senate Executive
Documents 14 and 32; page 22; Evidence 71,
82, 333, 336, 663, 472, 497.)
POWER TO DECLARE PEACE.
By the proclamation of April 2, 1866, the
President assumed a power not conferred by
any act of Congress to declare that—
" The insurrection is at an end, and is henceforth so
to be regarded."
The power to declare war is one of the high
powers of Congress.
By the laws of nations a state of war may
follow flagrant war, during which the law-mak-
ing power may continue the exercise of military
authority. The "reconstruction acts" of Con-
gress now authorize this over the rebel States,
and its termination depends on the authority
of Congress. Yet this power the President has
attempted to assume and exercise himself. If
this be tolerated it will act as a precedent for
dangerous encroachments on the powers of
Congress. It was an attempt on the part of the
President to withdraw from Congress the right
which he had exercised himself of maintaining
martial law over the rebel States and thus to
deny the power Bnd defeat the efficiency of the
'' reconstruction acts." *
THE LAW OF IMPEACHMENT.
And now I proceed to inquire—upon these
facts is the President by the established law
of the land impeachable?
I have already given some views to the pub-
lic on "the law of impeachment'' and I do not
propose to go into a full discussion of it now.
(American Law Register, September, 1867,
volume 6, N. S., 641.)
It is generally assumed and for the purpose
of this discussion I will say that the Constitu-
tion declares that the President is impeachable
for '' treason, bribery, or other high crimes and
misdemeanors."
At the time the Constitution was adopted,
and ever since in England and all the original
States of the Union, what is known as the
" common law" and common law crimes"
existed, and yet exist, in addition to crimes de-
fined by statute ; and this is so in all the States
except Ohio, and perhaps two or three others.
The common law makes almost every act crim-
inal which—
" Mischievously affects the person or property of
another, or openly outrages decency or disturbs pub-
lie order, or is injurious to public morals, or is a
breach of official duty."— Wharton'* Criminal Law,
section 3.
In addition to their technical, legal significa-
tion, the words "crime" and "misdemeanor"
have a "popular" or ''parliamentary " and a
"moral" sense. (4 Blackstone, 5 note by
Christian.)
In the parliamentary sense misdemeanor is
misconduct, misbehavior, maladministration.
By the Constitution judges "hold their offices
during good behavior." When good behavior
ceases, their right to office ceases. Impeach-
ment is the onljr remedy by which it can be
ascertained. It is competent to perform its
purpose without the aid of a statute, and no
act of Congress can destroy or impair the
power thus given. But unless the term '* mis-
behavior" is construed, as in English par-
liamentary history, in the popular sense, the
power of impeachment is nugatory. In the
moral sense crime or misdemeanor is violation
of moral or religious duty.
•Now, if the Constitution uses the words
"crimes" and "misdemeanors" only to des-
ignate offenses made indictable by act of Con-
gress, then the President may not be impeach-
able.
But if the Constitution includes not only
statutory crimes, but (besides treason as de-
fined in the Constitution, and bribery at com-
mon law) also other common law crimes and
misdemeanors of a high grade, then the Presi-
dent is impeachable, Kir he has by his usurpa-
tions violated the highest law of the land—
the Constitution ; he has violated acts of Con-
gress other than penal, and this is crime at
common law.
Bishop says:
" When a statute [or the Constitution] forbids a
thing affectinr the public, but provides no penalty
the doing of it is indictable at common law." (535
[349] 187 [84.]) " Wheneverthe law statutory or com-
mon casts on one a duty of a public nature, any ncg-
lect of the duty or act done in violation of it is indict-
able."—Criminal Law, 537 [350], 913.
For the purposes of the impeachment we are
now considering it is enough to say the words
of the Constitution "high crimes and misde-
meanors" include common law as well as stat-
utory offenses. But the Constitution, accord-
ing to its true interpretation, goes further,
using the words "high crimes and misde-
meanors" in the "parliamentary" sense,
which includes crimes by statute, crimes by
the common law, and crimes against the State
or nation by maladministration or misconduct,
Erovided the act committed or duty omitted
e such as by'modern parliamentary usage
and the judgment of the civilized world rises
to the dignity of a uhigh misdemeanor."
And this is as definite and no less latitudi-
narian than the common law itself, which is ' 'the
ferfection of reason" as determined by courts,
or even in England not all common law
