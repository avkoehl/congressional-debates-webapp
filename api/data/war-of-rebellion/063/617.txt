PINE BLUFF, May 16, 1864.

Brigadier-General CARR:

I have no information of any of the enemy's forces except his cavalry, which I believe to be considerably scattered. There is certainly a force ar Jenkins' Ferry, another at Marks' Mills, near Mount Elba. There is about two brigades at Monticello and vicinity, and I think there is still more cavalry below Monticello near Hamburg. I think the position of the enemy's force can be better ascertained by sending small scouting parties in every direction, under the command of dashing officers, with instructions to observe the enemy without being observed. This can be done by traveling through the woods, avoiding his pickets, and getting on the flank, and, if possible, in the rear of his encampments. Until we know more of the enemy's main force I do not think it would be safe to allow ourselves, and especially our infantry, be drawn far in any direction.

POWELL CLAYTON,

Colonel, Commanding Post.
