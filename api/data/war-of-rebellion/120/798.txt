Lieutenant-Colonel CHANDLER:

(Care Lieutenant-Colonel Harvie, assistant inspector-general,

Hood's Army of Tennessee.)

The following extract from your report of inspection of prisons at Andersonville, Ga., was referred to the Commissary-General for his information and action:

Captain J. W. Armstrong, assistant commissary of subsistence, left the post shortly after my arrival on sick-leave, locking up nearly all his books and papers. I was consequently unable to make a satisfactory examination into his affairs. Enough entirely incompetent for the discharge of the duties of his position, and should at once be removed.

* * * * * * * *

The Commissary-General returned the paper with the request that information may be furnished that Bureau which Colonel Chandler states to have been elicited by him and upon which he bases his opinion that Captain Armstrong, assistant commissary of subsistence, is incompetent. Without such information this Bureau can take no action with the view of getting rid of the "inefficient officer. "

By direction of the Adjutant-General you will as soon as practicable, furnish this office with an additional report respecting the officer mentioned, giving the necessary information request by the Commissary-General.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. McRAE SELPH,

Assistant Adjutant and Inspector General.
