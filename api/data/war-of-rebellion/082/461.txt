CITY POINT, July 26, 1864-9.30 p.m.

Major General GEORGE G. MEADE:

The enemy may show such a force between Deep Bottom and Richmond as to make our movement there more hazardous than was expected. If so, the Second Corps and the cavalry will be withdrawn to-morrow night, and by withdrawing them quietly and rapidly it may be practicable to make an assault on their return.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Orders have been sent to Wilson to bring up all men whose term of service expire by the 25th proximo. I had supposed they had gone, but I find over 300 of the Third Pennsylvania Cavalry on duty at these headquarters who had not been relieved as I had directed, and I have ordered them to proceed immediately to City Point, and they will be there by morning.

GEO. G. MEADE,Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, July 26, 1864-11 p.m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

I have the Examiner of to-day. It has another report from Hood, claiming eighteen colors and thirteen guns, dated July 23; says all is quiet, except occasional shells falling into Atlanta. The paper also states it is understood we have crossed 6,000 men at Deep Bottom, with a view of preventing their field batteries interrupting the navigation of the river. The paper will be sent to-morrow. Two deserters came in to-day who say there has been no recent movement of troops on their side. Telegram of 9.30 in cipher just received.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
