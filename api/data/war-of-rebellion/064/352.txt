SAINT LOUIS, June 13, 1864.

Major-General CURTIS:

Your dispatch received. There is no doubt the gangs of rebel guerrillas sifting into this department will try to rob, steal, and destroy here on a small scale and pass out over yours. Of course you don't intrude in such cases as you speak of. You know why I am so carefully not to ask Kansas troops into Missouri. The people with whom I have to deal are so jealous they would rather suffer from the guerrillas, and where they alone are interested I wish them to have their choice.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.

Yours of this date in regard to an attack by bushwhackers and the killing of 1 man and taking of 6 horses on the Missouri side, and only 1 mile from the ferry landing, is just received. the attack was reported to me about 10 or 11 o'clock this morning, and Major Hunt, with a competent force, has been ordered and moved in pursuit. My command is limited to the State line, but I follow such outlaws to the line of death and destruction.
