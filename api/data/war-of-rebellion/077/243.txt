slight skirmish on our advance, but reached Jackson with the loss of but 2 officers and 8 men. I destroyed the bridge, which I think was designed merely for temporary use, probably for the purpose of transferring the rolling-stock from the MISSISSIPPI Central Railroad to their eastern roads. While I was in Jackson the enemy took position on the road leading to Clinton, about three miles from Jackson. I attacked them at 4 a. m. on the 7th instant, and after an engagement of two hours' duration forced him back, and moved on toward Clinton. I could not follow them, having only sufficient supplies to last my command till it could reach Big Black River.

My losses are about 230 in killed and wounded and 20 missing. No property of any kind was lost or abandoned.

The forces of the enemy consisted of the brigade under Gholson, a force from Louisiana under Colonel Scott, and a few men under General Wirt Adams. I was informed that a regiment under Colonel (or General) Richardson was also present and took part in the engagement.

The officers and men of my command, without exception, behaved in a manner entitling them to the highest praise.

I shall leave here to-morrow, with a force very nearly the same, and attempt to reach Canton, hoping thereby to prevent their detachments from being sent to Forrest.

I will send a report more in detail at a very early day.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. W. SLOCUM,

Major-General, Commanding.

Lieutenant Colonel W. T. CLARK,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Department of the Tennessee.
