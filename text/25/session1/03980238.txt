25th Cong....1st Skss.                                 MaMnsr public officer's depositories—Mr. Legare.                                                 H. of Reps.
little spec e there has ever been in this country,
you may, by requiring it to be paid to you m a
large amount annually, make it always an article
of merchandise, jou will thus permanently dis-
credit bank notes, and lender impossible ihe resto-
ration of their convertibility But that is rot all,
even should this mischief not ensue, you at least,
by thus rejecting them, to the whole extent oí jour
transactions, abandon the currency to its fate, un-
der the administration of the States You make
no efforts, you exert no influence, to maintain its
purity and uniformity, by distinguishing betv ccn
corpc rations which redeem their notes, and those
which are notoriously insolvent You proclaim
your distru t oí all of them alike, you write it in
your statute-book, however disastious the condi-
tion of the monetary concerns of the States may
be, through want of skill, or want of concert, you
leave them to themselves, and that, when standing
m the most intimate and the most commanding re-
lation towards them, you might, if you gave your-
selves the least trouble about ihe matter, exercise
a most salutary contiol over them, and remed)
those great inconveniences for the benefit of us all
For, sir, it is not enough to say you have no poue ,
strictly so called, under the constitution, to reguhte
the currency I admit that you have none What
then ' Have you no influence—influence of ex-
ample—influence of precept—influence of autho-
nty—influence of patronage—influence of con-
nexion and custom in business, in the use of Ihese
very deposites ' Has not the constitution pro\ ided
that all detects m out institutions shall be corrected
by amendments regulaily recommended and intro-
duced, and is it not one of yourduttes so to recom-
mend and mtioduce them'
Why do you not uige upon the States any re-
form you may judge necessary in the matter ' I
appeal to every one that hears me, what he should
think of an individual, who, possessing immense
influence in a community, with an income of rmny
millions a >ear, should, m a time of trouble, coolly
withdraw himself from society, and hoard his
money, like a usurer in a commercial panic, wait-
ing until the extreme necessities of his neighbors
shall throw them upon his mercy ' Is this *he mo-
rality we are taught m our private relations ' Shall
nothing be expected from him to whom so muí h
has been given ' Shall he hide his light under a
bushel? Shall hebuiy his ten talents in the eauh,
and escape condemnation as an unprofitable ser-
vant' And shall that be right in a Got eminent,
which, in a private ppis/m, shocks the moral si nse
of all mankind 'ma Got cm men l sfinding tow aids
the people of this counliy in rehtions so veiy pe-
culiar ' Sir, v. hat ansu er would y ou have to give
to the States, if, m a moment of public calamity,
like that which is just passing away, feeling their
distresses aggravated thiongh your harsh exactions
of what their people had not to guc, appealing in
vain to j on lor succor or for counsel, they were
to bold to iou the language which md gnaiton and
astonishment «ould naturally mspne, under such
extraordinary circumstances ' If they w ere to say
to you, " We have done every thing to exalt and
to magnify you—we have clothed \ou with au-
thority and awe—we have armed \ou with mighty
powers, with the axes and fasces of supreme juris-
diction—we have surrounded you with all the glo-
nous eqmpaue and pomp of empire, endowed vou
wiih a last treasury, with fleets, armies, senates,
judges—that palace, these gorgeous domes—this
capüohum fulgens—what for' that you should re-
nounce all commumiy of interest, all sympathy
with us' that there should be no ties of affection
or of duty between us"? that you should ostenta-
tiously proclaim 3 ourselves, as your woist enemies
havi 5 rretimes alleged that 30U aie, a foreign Go-
vernmcrf 11 the rridst oi 0111 courtiy, and even
avail jonrn.1 is of a mom nt oí uuH revulsior
and calami'^, to make us fee' that you are so in
spmt and m tru h "' Sn, 1 do 1 0 1 now, I cannot
conceive, how such a com e «ho ¡id fail to stiike
every body as a perversion of rll the eie-ral obli-
gat 00s of morality, which are and oueht to be, as
binding upon communities, as upon the individuals
tnat compose them, how gentlemen ca 1, a' such a
moment as the present, entertain, without emotion,
be strange proposition, that this Government should
buiy itself, like Sardanapalus, in a selfish repose,
a degenerate and inglorious indifference to all the
interests of the country or, if I can make such a
comparison without shocking them too much, that,
like Nero, it should fiddle while Rome is burning
Agreeing, then, sir, with the Executive in the
principles laid down m the message, I differ with
it in the practical inferences deduced from them.
In the division of power between the Government
and the States, I think with it, that all that is re-
quired to meet this emergency, has not been given
to the former But the inadequacy of our poweis
is no excuse for not exerting them to the uttermost
for the public good, especially as there is reason to
think that the convention did not foresee the present
state of things We can do much, if «e cannot
do every thing The occasion calls only foi a eood
will, and a moderate share of practical ability,
and I have no hesitation in saying, that among the
existing banking institutions of the country, can
be found ample means of accomplishing the two
great objects of restoring specie payments, and
maintaining hereafter, in all ordinary times, % con-
vertible currency, which 1  all that we can expect
to do
Sir, I do not wish to be misunderstood It is of the
utmost importan! e that the paper of f he banks should
not only not in fact be deprecnted, (as I believe
is actually the case,) but should be able to stand
the only sure, and, to the public at large, satisfac-
tory, test of that fact, I mean eomerhbthly into
specie I am fully aware that the accident of a
failure in the means of making their pavments 111
the precious metals, is one against winch, according
to the course of modern commerce, there can
be no complete security, and that nothing
can be more absuidly exaggerated, than the
importance attached to that occurrence, by per-
sons not familiar with the principles of bank-
ing, when it happens in consequence of an ex-
traordinary demand from abroad, or a sudden
panic within Naj, more I admit that the most
usual effect of a gieat revtils on in trade, is, to
throw much paper out of circulation, 'o contract
the currency, and so to bring down exchanges and
prices, and raise the value of the money that re-
mains m the hands of the public But a suspension
of specie payments, though it mav not be a pie-
sent evil, is always fraught with danger It is the
indispensable duty of a statesman to put an end to
it as soon as possible, either by encouragement
or by compulsion It is for this, among other lea-
sons, that I so cheerfully acquiesced m the issuing
of Treasury notes, inasmuch as it relieved us
from the necessity either of dirtcfly refusing to
take the paper of the b-inks at par, or, by receiving
it, (a* vve might otheiwise very safelj have done,)
of betraying those companies into an impolitic en-
largement of their issues, befoie ihe balance of
payments had been turned in our favor—as I hope
it will be, by Ihe coming crop I íegarded it as an
excellent temporary expedient, for avoiding, at pre-
sent, this choice of evils So far, I think nothing
more unfounded than tne general chaige of insol-
vency against all our banks, which is so inconsi-
derately uttered by the press, and 111 debate, as w ell
as the assert on tepeated over and over again, on
this floor, that the country is laboring under an ex-
cessive and depreciated cunency It is not yet so,
but it will, I fear, veiy soon be so, if the banks do
not make an etlort to return to specie payments m
the course of a few months Now is the time to
do so now that their issues are contracted , that
importations have been checked , that exchanges
are become more favorable, and that the great
southern crops aie about to be sent forward to
make them still more so Let ev ery one interested
111 the fite of these institutions, as well as in the
commeicial prosperity of the country, exert what-
ever influence he may possess, to bung about that
íesult, and to deliver the banks from the tempta-
ti( ns to dangeious excess, to which the retun of
an active and prosperous business will inevitably
expose them, it they do not, once more, lay them-
selves under the restiamt of convertibility
Sir, should the) unhappily take a diffeient couise,
and should this Government, liter using all its in-
fluence and authority, to establish the currency of
J the countiy on a better footing, fail of success in
its niost zealous endeavors, I admit that it may be
driven to the necessity of taking care of its own
business and creditors, by independen legislation
of its own There is no doubt that a variously
depreciated currency cannot be tolerated as the
settled system of the country. The ports of one
State cannot be preferred to those of another, in
this way, any mo*e than by an express statute to
that effect Nor can the public creditor be justly
paid in money really depreciated,—I mean not in
reference merely to gold and silver, which are
themselves liable to great fluctuations in value, but
to the general mass of commodities that compose
the conveniences and necessaries of life The ef-
fects of a redundant currency, when once the)' be-
gin to be distinctly perceived, are counteracted by
a general rise of prices Money is twice as easy
to be got, but you have to pay twice as much for
every thing which it buys But there is one class
<if persons who have no means of indemnifying
themselves by raising the nominal value of their
property or their claims It is the class of those
whs live on fixed incomes—annuitants, fundholders,
functionaries of States, pensioners They are paid
a certain sum, and with every diminution m the
value it expresses, they lose just so much of what
they are fairly entitled to. In this view of the sub-
ject, therefore, it is quite clear, that Government is
under the highest of all moral obligations to see
that their dues be not paid them in what is really
worth a gieat deal less than it purports to be.
What I have hitherto said relates to the first
question propounded by the bill on your table—shall
gold and silver only be received in payment of
Government dues As to the second inquiry, sir,
whether the revenue shall be kept by officers of our
own, or by the banks, and if the latter, whether
in the shape of speGial or gen ial deposite, so much
has been said, and so ably said, upon that head,
against the sy sttm recommended by the message,
that I am very little disposed to trouble the com-
mittee with anv additional remarks in regard to it
Were I driven to make a choice between the two
plans referred to, I should, as at present advised,
greatly piefer (hat of a special deposite, on a small
commission, as at once the safest, the cheapest, and
most simple—as departing less from our previous
customs, and not being so liable to the great practi-
cal objection of going permanently to increase the
already enormous and disproportionate influence of
the Fxecutrve power, which, beyond all doubt, far
exceed  any thing that was anticipated by the
founders of the Government, and seriously threatens
to disturb, if not to subvert, the whole balance of the
eonstitutisin 1 need not say that I have no refer-
ence whatever to the piesent, or any other indi-
vidual incumbent I speak of the operations of
gieat general causes, and of a system, whose effects
are almost entirely independent of the will of man.
Another very grave objection to the scheme report-
ed by the committee, is its resemblance, or, at least,
its fearful leaning to that of a gieat political Bank
of the United States, of which a justly celebrated
leport of one of my predecessors, upon this floor,*
demonstrated, some years ago, the dangers and in-
conveniences, as I have always supposed, to the
universal conviction of the people But although
I should prefer the special deposite system to that
of the Committee of Ways and Means, I am not
> et prepared to adopt it That immense benefits
have been conferred upon the country, by adding to
üs productive capital, the large amounts of public
money which would otheiwise have lain dormant
in the Treasury, does not adm't of a question. I
«ill venture to say thatm the course of the half
century that has elapsed since '89, countless millions
have been ihe fruit of this truly paternal and bene-
ficent system Our predecessors, Mr Dallas among
them, seem to hav e been deeply impressed with
Mr McDuffie Report of the Committee of Ways and
Means, 111 l^l Mr Gallatin remains of this system of sub
tteasuiies, pre ented as an alternative to a Hank of the United
fetales, m his celebrated pamphlet on that -ubicct that 'with
the exception of the power 0' receiving p-n ate depositee, the
object of which provision is not perceived, this is precisely the
«pecies of national bank which hasg been suggested m the
President's last message (1830 > The question w lether the
purchase of drafts would, as we think, be a charge on the Trea
&uiy, or prove, as seems tobe expected a source of profit, 1 
one of secondary importance It is sufficient to obseivethat
the issues of the State banks could not, nor indeed is it expected
that they ■ ould, b« cheeked by thi«i plan
