1854.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

appropriated, although >t is true that they cannot
be so well and thoroughly completed as if this
appropriation is made.
I repeat, that lam in favor of the appropriations,
because I think they are necessary to complete
the buildings in the most perfect manner; but if
Congress refuses to grant them, it will not stop
the work.
The question was then taken on Mr. Disney's
amendment 10 the amendment, and it was rejected.
Mr. PERKINS, of Louisiana. 1 intend to
vote against all these appropriations for custom-
houses.
The CHAIRMAN. Does the gentleman from
Louisiana propose an amendment to the amend-
ment?
Mr. PERKINS. Yes, sir; I move to decrease
the appropriation for the custom-house at Cincin-
nati live dollars.
I intend to vote against all these appropriations
for custom-houses, and in favor of all those for
marine hospitals; and as I have much more to say
than I can express in five minutes, 4 will speak
rapidly, giving only a few figures, and embodying
the rest in the report of my remarks.
Mr. TAYLOR, of Ohio, (interrupting.) Be-
fore the gentleman from Louisiana proceeds with
his remarks, I should like to hear his amendment
read.
Mr. PERKINS. I will withdraw the amend-
ment I have offered, and move to amend the
amendment by striking out'all in relation to cus-
tom-houses, so as to leave only the appropriations
for marine hospitals. I do this because I intend
to vote against ail the appropriations for custom-
houses, and in favor of all those for marine hos-
pitals which have not been built, on conditions
attached to former appropriations, that no more
money should be appropriated to them.
I dislike the very idea of a deficiency bill. The
name itselfsuggests a wrong—a want of forecast—
an error somewhere. There are instances, and
they occur every year, when deficiencies are ne-
cessary and should be supplied before the period
of the regular annual appropriation. But, as was
remarked by the gentleman from Virginia, [Mr.
Batly,] and as is verified by the legislation of
the country, this accidental and casual provision,
originally the result of a temporary necessity, has
grown into a principle, and from it has resulted that,
instead of having one annual general appropriation
bill passed at the end of each session, we have in
fact two; and amendments offered to one and re-
jected, after discussion, are fiequently tacked on
to the other.
I dislike the bill for another reason: The esti-
mates in it are too large. We have now a large
surplus m the Treasury. Under ordinaly circum-
stances, there is a care imposed upon us by our
necessities. At this time the reverse is the case;
and while everything* stimulates to extravagance,
it is prudent—it is becoming—that the Democratic
party, now that we have a Democratic Adminis-
tration,after having preached economy throughout
the country, and assailed the extravagance of the
Whigs, should take care that the expenditures of
the present do not exceed those of the last Ad-
ministration. I am in favor of a wise, nota. nig-
gardly economy; and I never did indulge in abuse
of Mr. Fillmore's administration" in this respect.
On the contrary, I think its estimates compare
favorably with the appropriations proposed m this
bill. His last deficiency bill, as passed, was less
than the first proposed under this Democratic Ad-
ministration.
But 1 have a greater, and, with me, a more influ-
ential reason for opposing the provisions of this
amendment. It is, that in connection with every
one of these works, there are conditions precedent
which preclude their supporters from asking any
further appropriations.
The gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Disney] asks,
how couid any gentleman living on the banks of
the Mississippi,*" or in the West, go home and j
give a reason that would bear examination for j
voting against the amendment. Sir, I find that m  
1851 an appropriation of $75,000 was^ made for j
the purchase of the site and construction of the
gentleman's custom-house at Cincinnati, with the
express condition that the whole cost should not
exceed that appropriation. This amendment proposes
to exceed that sum $15,000.
In the case of the custom-house at St. Louis,
there aie actually, in two different years, condi-
tions precedent to the use of the money then ap-
propriated, that they should not receive another
dollar. In 1851, $50,000 was appropriated, with
a proviso that the whole cost should not exceed
that sum. In 1852, a further appropriation was
made, with the same condition; and yet, in spite
of those two conditions precedent to the use of
the appropriation, in 1853 there was appropriated
$115,000 for continuing that very work, and the
present amendment proposes to add $100,000 to
that!
In the appropriation for the custom-house, treas-
ury, and other offices in Louisville, the case will
be found to be exactly similar. We provided for
the site and construction of a custom-house, post
office, court-room, and other offices, provided the
whole should not exceed the amount appropriated.
That was m 1852, and yet they now come here in
the deficiency bill, alleging that the Government
will suffer a loss if a further appropriation for the
building is postponed even to the close of the ses-
sion. In this way, Mr. Chairman, I might pro-
ceed through the whole bill.
Where is this thing to stop? The former chair-
man of the Committee of Ways and Means [Mr.
Bayly] said that within his experience it had been
going on and on until it had become an evil which
ought to be checked. We have a Democratic
House of Representatives, with more new mem-
bers in it than have been in any Housewithin the
last ten years. We have a new Administration;
one that came in pledging economy. Now is the
time to practice it. The figures that I give to the
House are drawn from a caieful examination of
the acts of Congress, and are, I believe, strictly
correct.

Mr. DISNEY. I desire, Mr. Chairman, to say
a word or two by way of reply. The arguments
the gentleman has adduced against the particular
case which he mentions of the custom-house at
, Cincinnati, apply with their whole force to every
item of the deficiency bill. How came the defi-
ciency bill here at all? Were not all the other ap-
i propriations specially limited and provided for m
1 the preceding acts of Congress? Did not these
I officers specially state in regard to all these cases,
i that the amounts then estimated for would besuf-
1 ficient? Did not Congress act upon them, and do
I they not come here again ? Does not the Com-
! mittee of Ways and Means asjf this body to make
, additional appropriations to the amount of mil-
1 lions ? That is your deficiency bill itself. Every
! fact, every argument, every reason which thegen-
j tleman from Louisiana [Mr. Perkins] has ad-
duced against the practice pursued in reference to
