WASHINGTON, D. C., April 11, 1865.

Major-General POPE,

Saint Louis:

General Grant's orders were to send all cavalry horses in the West to General Canby. This, I presume, was to fit out Canby's cavalry and to refit Wilson's when it reached the Gulf coast. I cannot change these instructions till I can consult General Grant.

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

WASHINGTON, D. C., April 11, 1865.

Major General J. J. REYNOLDS,

Little Rock, Ark.:

Print and circulate the correspondence between Generals Grant and Lee for the surrender of Lee's army. Perhaps General Kirby Smith and others may accept the same terms. It is believed that the rebel forces in North Carolina are about to lay down their arms on the same conditions. Jeff. Davis' Assistant Secretary of War has come in, and admits that the Confederate Government has gone up, and the leaders ask for terms. Those who refuse to surrender now may be harshly treated hereafter.

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
