HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES,May 13, 1864-12.40 p.m.

Major-General BURNSIDE:

The lieutenant-general desires to know the news you may have of the movement of the enemy. Are they force, where, and how moving?

By order of Lieutenant-General Grant:

F. T. DENT,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Aide-de-Camp.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,May 13, 1864-1 p.m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

GENERAL: The telegram just sent you does not convey my own impression. I think the enemy are retreating, but their movement s so well protected as to make it very hard to determine. I will send you more definite information as soon as possible.

A. E. BURSNSIDE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,May 13, 1864-5 p.m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

GENERAL: I have just ordered an advance upon the enemy's lines, which has demonstrated that they are there in sufficient force to make it doubtful whether we can carry them or not, but I am still under the impression that they are making arrangements to fall back. My left as it now stands is very weak, and in case we are attacked, that part of the line would need support. If there is a surplus division near this point it might be well to let me have it.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES,May 13, 1864-6.20 p.m.

Major-General BURNSIDE:

There will be a night movement of two corps from the right to your left. They will attack immediately on getting into position, if the chance offers. Be ready to support them, if required.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,May 13, 1864-8.15 p.m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

GENERAL: Your dispatch of 6.20 is received, and will receive immediate attention. I will make more definite arrangements as soon as I hear from you the time and route the troops will take, which will be brought, I presume, by one of your aides-de-camp.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.
