Thanks for your further dispatches. Can you answer my queries about Leetown? We have urged General Wallace to send you 1,000 infantry, but can only get a few hundred men to strength Monocacy. We have also fully advised General Halleck and Secretary of War and begged them to aid you. Glad to hear general's views about bridge.
