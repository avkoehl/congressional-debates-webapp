HUNTSVILLE, April 3, 1865-3.30 p.m.

Brigadier-General WHIPPLE:

Have seen the original order purporting to come from General Roddey. I don't believe he wrote it, though a good counterfeit. Guntersville is the point selected for crossing in the order. There is no Confederate force now north or south of the river; on this side not to exceed 400, on the south not over 500. Those on this side are occupied in stealing stock from the Northern planters and will break them up if we have not soon a cavalry force to protect them. I am out on a tour of inspection.

R. S. GRANGER,

Brigadier-General.
