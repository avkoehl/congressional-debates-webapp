Brigadier-General CHAPMAN,

Commanding Second Brigade:

Please direct a small force to move out between the two rivers and watch for movements of the enemy's cavalry toward Strasburg. General Sheridan will attack the enemy at Round Top and Fisher's Hill. Merritt is at Strasburg watching the enemy; Averell is to the right, and we shall probably attack the cavalry at Front Royal to-night or very early in the morning. I am very anxious to be apprised of any movement from there.

Very respectfully,

J. H. WILSON,

Brigadier-General.
