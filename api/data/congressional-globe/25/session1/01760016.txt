States also, had made provisions for the expendi-
ture of this money, had already applied it to vari-
our great and useful objects, relying on the solemn
faith of a law of Congress, passed alter the fullest
deliberation by that body On such a law, not
deeming that it w ould be lightly broken or rescind-
ed upon the* first pretext, Kentucky had built her
expectation of this money, and had acted upon
that expectation, and had disposed of it by antici-
pation. Therefore, not only on the ground that
this money would not be available to the General
Government was this bill objectionable, but also on
the ground tint its present withdrawal fiom the
Slates would be highly injurious aud inconvenient
to them On this ground the bill ía his v ew w as
eminently objeetiomble
Was the faith pledged by an act of Congress to
be so lightly broken? Was an expectation based
upon such ground, to be with such indifference and
facility disappointed1 Was it worth no effort—no
exertion—no trouble, to Keep a promse' to stand
by a law' to fulfil an engagement' TheStates vveie
minted to accept this deposite, it was no boon of
their soliciting, and now, after it has been offered
—after it has been promised—?iter it has been ac-
cepted—after it has been spent—after numberless
schemes and plans foi its employment, all benefi-
cial to the States, have been devised and settled,
and are waiting the payment of this fourth instal-
ment foi the r completion, is it now the time to re-
cede from our engagement1 Is is now the time to
break a promise' Is it now the time to -violate a
pledge, and say that you have not got the money'
Might it not be replied, vou have get the money,
but you will not let the States have it1 Such, m
fact, would be the effect of the passagi of this bill1
Yes, sir, the money is there, the money is m the
banks, the States are willing to receive it, but Con-
giesj interposes, and, by this bill, says " No, )ou
shall notreceive it "
We are told by the snppoitcrs and advocates of
this bill that it niu t be passed, becau e it w ould be
highly impolitic to borrow money in order to depo-
site it with the States This, sir, is not the correct
view of the case tais is not a fair statement of the
question this, sir, is not the question at all The
question is this The States have ü en led to expect
this fund, on the faith of a law t) ey have made
improvements, entered into contracts, mcuned ex-
penses on the expectation of receiving this money,
pledged to them by the law, and now, sir, the
question is, "Is there no light on the pait of the
Slates, is there no obligxtion on the piit of lie
General Government to fulfil the 1 iw'' Shall the
law be set as do on the mere plea of mconv enience'
That, sir, is the question, the great question'
Whether a solemn law shall be fulfilled—w nether
a pledge shall be redeemed—whether a promise
shall be pel formed—whether there exists ->ny obli-
gation to fulfil promises given, and not to disap-
point expectations gratuitously raised' Shill we
be told, sir, that there exists no such obi gdtion' It
is, in ray view, the highest obligition which at-
taches to any Government Now, m answ er to
this, we are met by the pica of c nvemence Wo
are told it would be very inconvenient to fulfil
this contract with the States, that money will have
to be borrowed for the purpose, and, therefore,
since it would not be quite convenient to fulfil the
obligation, the obligation ought to be broken, and
the faith of if* law violited1
But there is also arother plea for this measure
I understand gentleman to =aj that flu re is not
money enough in the Treasury *o pay this four'h
instalment But, sir, laying aside the question
how far such an argument ought to prevail o in-
duce the vio'ation of a solemn engagemei t, let us
ask, as to the f ict, whether there are, in teed,
no funds foi the pu t pose of meeting this engagement'
On Jookmg over the íeport of the Secretary of the
Treasury, (said Mr C.) I only find a piobabditv
spoken of He says, there may probably be a
«teficit, and not thaf there is The argumert
therefore js divested of its mam strength, and that
is, of the absolute fact necessary to sustain it But,
sir, if there arano funds adapted to the waists of
the General Government, there are funds which
the States would willingly receive They have
confidence m the banks, ihey would receive their
paper Thej aie not engaged m warfaie against
them, they do not wish to destroy 'hem, and to
destroy the credit of the country and of t íe people,
while, on thp other hand, there are no funds for ihe
use of the General Government only because it will
not recognise oui money, our funds, our credit, and
wi'I only receive gold and silver, it is not willing
to go hand in hand w ith the people m aiding and
assisting to suppoit "nd sustain that credit which is
the life and soul of the business, trade, and com-
merce of the natun
Again, sn, let me expose another monstrous idea
which seeing to possess the gentlemen who have
brought forward, and those who aavo<.ate this bill,
an erroneous idea, indeed, ot which it were well
that they were dispossessed, and it is this, sir
they seem to imagine that tl is money belongs to
the Government Not ro, sir, (s-nd Mi C ) f^r
from it it belongs to the States—it b longs to the
peop e, fro n whom toe Government has gathered
and collected it, but wl ich gathering and collect-
ing did not make it its ow n Therefoie, sir, in ad-
dition to the many strong leasons wh\ this money
should not be withheld from us, the ¡eason above
all is, that it is our own money
The President of the United States in his Mes-
sage had red a lecture on economy to Congress,
and to the people of tnis coun'ty, and had told
them that the distress and exigency of the times
which have brought us heie are to be attributed to
the extravagance of the people Now, sir, it is
very strange that it never occured to the President
that economy wastl all things th it m which the
Government itself was most deficient, that econo
my was especially needpd to be put m practice by
it, that the tide of p odigahty and high expenditure
of millions upon millions, in which it had of late
jeats indulged, it was now high time should be
stopped Strange, sir is it that the Picsident, bc-
lore he m->de this charge upon the pet p e did n t
lo k to the ci y mg necessity for '■eiarn and econo-
my in the Government itself
In a time of distress like this, when the Govern-
ment gives to the people such lessons of economy,
what conduct do we behold m the Government'
Anv approach, s r, to economy' No, sir, none
whatever on the contrary, all the recommendations
of the Message, and all the measures of the admi-
nistration, are, notwithstanding the people's dis-
tress, and notwithstanding the lessons of economy
read to them by the President, directed and aimed
at the oí e single and only object or filling theTrea-
suiy wi'i money' of 1 eepmg the Government
somg of ptoviding m ans foi i profus^ and vvlid
extravagance of expenditure Befoie we vote for
the issue of Tieasmy notes, I feel it my duty, sir,
to inquire to what extent letrenchment may not be
carried into llie expcndituies of tne Deoartments
All eyes are turned upon you, the people look to
you lot relief, and what do we behold' Why, sir,
all the inquiry made, all the measures proposed,
arc merely how to fill the Treasary w uh money1
Sauve qmpent' is the cry of the Government All
its efforts are directed to help itself, to save i sell,
lo cut loose from the geneml v\ ieck, and leave the
ccuntry to help i elf as it best may be able1 Is
this the d Uy of a Government' when we come
here for th  expíe s purDose of gning relief then
only to bung foiwaid a bill like this, to withhold
money from the States, and othei bills as bad m
their pnnciple, to raise more money from them, in
ordei to sustain, and help and fill the Treasury,
while nothing is done or thought of fox the people?
Mr BROWN said, he had not intended, at that
stage of f1 e bill, to delay its early parage by any
remail s of his but m consequence of the observa-
tions wheh had fallen from tne two gentlemen,
who in the course of thatmoinuig had addressed the
Senate, he would taiie the occasion to make a few
lemarks in íeply, and in justificQtion of the vote
which it was his purpose to give on the measure
then before them
In addition to the arguments which had already
been urged, and which to his mind were conclu-
sive, m favor of v ithholdmg the fourth instalment
payable to the Several States on the fust of October,
under ihe deposite act, another aigument entitled
to still mole weighty consideration had decided his
mind in favor of that couise     If we lefuse to pass
the bul having that object m view, the obligation
will unavoidably devolve em Congress to provide
the means to meet the payment of the msta'ment,
which will othenv íse become due to the States, the
available means of the Treasury being inadeq late
for that purpose Now he (Mr B ) could not see
many part of the Constitution the power to iatse
money, and of necessity the powei to tax our con-
stituents to pay the money thus raised, for the mere
purpose sf depositing it in the treasuries of the
several States The power to raise money vv as
limited to the objects and duties with which the
General Government was charged by the Constitu-
tion, and in no part of that instrument was the
powei to be found, either by express grant or im-
plication to raise it for any such purpobe It could
not be pretended, that to raise money for such
pu-pose was to carry into effect any power be-
longing to the General Government To his
mind, therefoie, it was a palpable violation of
the Constitution to exercise sucn power, whieh they
unquestionably would hove to do, in providing the
means to meet the lemammg instalment, if its pay-
ment should not be postponed He diew a dis-
tinction between the power of Congiess to autho-
rize the deposite of a °urplus m the State treasunes
vvh ch already existed, and the power to raise mo-
ne^ for the sole purpose of thus depositing it It
was in mat point of view, that he deemed the de-
posite act of last year justifiable, that act, had, m
the course of its execution exhausted ihe surplus,
which was, the tine object Cong ess had in view in
passing it, and having fulfilled its great end, he was
of opinion its further operation should now cease
He thought the gentleman from South Carolina
(Mr Preston) would have much difficulty m re-
conciling the vote which he had announced his in-
tention to give on this question, with the doctr nes
ot a stnct construction ol the Constitution, of which
he had leretofue prot ssed himself a zealous ad-
vocate He called on that gentleman to show
what constitutional authonty Congress had to pass
a law raising money not in execution of any of its
conceded powers, but for the avowed purpose of
being deposited with the States It had been
argued by the same gentleman that strong expedi-
tions had leen created among the States, that the
instalment which it is now proposed to with-
hold, would be paid over to them, and that
an equitable obligation was imposed en Con-
gress not to disappoint those expectations He
contended that the idea of an equitable oblrjj
gation on Congress to pay ov er the money was utter
ly des'royed, by ihe power given to th  Secretary
of the íieasuiy m the deposite act to call on the
States, uiu'or eeitain íestnctions, for the repayment
of the sums deposited with them Tne pow er thus
given to that ofluer by the act in question, was, in.
effect, a notice to the St ites that the Government
of the United States might want the money depo-
sited with them, and, n that event, would require
its repayment He considered the same notice as
substantially applicable as regarded the instalment
yet unpail, and v as, ¡n itself, a \ery significant
mi1 eation that Congress w ould withhold any part
ot the mon*y unpaid, should a contingency arise
making it nee ssary to do sc. That contingency
had arisen, making it proper, m his opinion, to
withhold that \ Inch remained unpaid, but he
trusted that no re would arise making it necessaiy
to call on the States for that portion ol the surplus
revenue a'read^ depo ited with them
Besides the cun'titutional objection to raising
money for the puipose of depositing it with the
States, the unavoidab e consequence of providing
for the payment of the remaining instalment to
them vi ould be to lav the foundatun of a new
national debt, than which nothing, in his opinion,
would be more prepostere us when resorted to for
ihe unauthorized purpose of dividing money
among the States He v ould m no event vote for
any measure leading to the creation of a national
debt, unless it could be made appear to be mdic-
pensable to aid the Government m the performance
of its legitimate functions
It had not been w ithout some surpnsp, that he
had heard the charge of harsh and unjust treat-
ment towards the States, in reference to the pro-
posed   measure   especially, brought against   the
