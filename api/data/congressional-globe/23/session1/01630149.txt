destructive of the commerce and business of the
country, or, to use the language of the gentleman
from South Carolina once more, they declare it to
be "alia piece ofvillanous cheateiy "
Sir, with ihe views which 1 entertain of these
resolutions, 1 cannot do more than to move that
they be laid upon your table and be printed, with
the application of the Exchange Bank in Portland
for the deposite  [These lesolutions were in
favor of the restoration of the deposites, and have
been heretofore published ]
Mr EVANS, of Mame, wished his colleague
to withdraw his motion, as he desired to submit a
few remarks in relation to the resolutions, which
request having been acceded to—
Mr E believed that the first of the propositions
just submitted from the Legislature of Maine, had
a similar origin with others presented to them
But, although he had as much respect as any one
could have for the body from which it emanated,
he might be permitted to say, without being consid-
ered disrespectful to them, that they were not ex
actly competent to pronounce, as they did, that the
whole policy pursued by Madison, Jefferson, and
others for nearly forty years, was unconstitutional
The assertions set forth in the preamble to the
resolution not being supported by any evidence,
he would take leave to be excused from coming to
the conclusion that they did, to govern his conduct
upon these measures
With respect to the memorial presented from
inhabitants of Portland, which was of a different
character from the other, he could testify that it
emanated from a body of men who were influenced
in presenting them by a knowledge of the actual
state of things in their neighborhood, and not with
any reference to paity,many of them having been
always, and for aught he knew, still were friendly
to the existing Administration from its first aeces
sion to power, and this he would assert, notwith-
standing it had been said that the resolutions came
from those who were always friendly to the bank
But did it follow that although they might be
friendly to that institution, that they were not
friendly to the Administration ?
Mr E then briefly adverted to the posi'ior in
which the bank was placed by trie conduct pursued
towards it by the Secretary of the Treasury He
denied that the curtailments made by the bank
arose from any inten tion on their part to create dis-
tress, as he considered it was a duty incumbent
upon them when they were called upon to pay up
the public deposites to make such a curtailment as
would best compoit with the safety of the institu-
tion under such circumstances and their own
interests, in which the safety of the whole com-
munity was also involved He thought they were
justified throughout, and would conclude by com
mending the resolutions from Portland to the calm
consideiation of Congress
Mr POLK rose to warn the House not to be
drawn into these wide discussions on the general
subject upon every memorial which should be pre-
sented to them It had airead y occupied their atten
tion to the exclusion of almost all other important
business for nearly two months, and he rose also
to express his hope that the House, after these two
months thus spent in a discussion which other-
wise appeared to be endless, would at length see
how important it was that the subject should be
brought to a close He could affirm that this was
demanded from them by a due regard for the pub-
lic interest, now suffering heavily m consequence
of this discussion If the memorials were referred
at once to the Committee of Ways and Means
that committee would not be long in presenting to
the House a report with their views, then the
whole subject would be open for full consideration,
and they would have something tangible—some
distinct proposition upon which they could delib-
erate and act
Sir, the wholp business community is agitated by
the continued discussion of this question, and their
interest requires that it should be settled He
hoped that the House would sit late and hear the
discussion until it should be brought to a close
To morrow or next day, he trusted, we should
meet with the determination of disposing of the
motions before the House There was not a mem
ber of this House who did not, every day, receive
letters from a distance urging the speedy action of
Congress on this subject    He would apoeal to the
friends of the bank, and ask whether they did not,
at the commencement of this discussion, press the
importance of the early action of Congress on the
subject'
Mr GORHAM role to a question of order, and
asked whether it was m order for the gentleman
to go into the general character of the debate?
The CHAIR said the general discussion on the
presentation of a petition could only be gone into
with the assent of the House
Mr POLK said he had only claimed the indul-
gence which had already been extended to those i
gentlemen who preceded him He would repeat
that he hoped the House would to-morrow meet
with a determination to dispose of the question
now pending
The resolutions were then referred to the Com-
mittee of Ways and Means, and ordered to be
printed.
Mr MANN, of New York, presented thejomt
resolutions of the Legislature of New York, ap-
proving the removal of the deposites, and instruct-
ing her Senators and requesting her Representatives
to oppose the recharter of the Bank of the United
States
Mr M said that he had intended to submit a
few remarks on this occasion, explanatory of the
views and opinions of a very large majority of the
people of the State which he had the honor in part
to represent on the subject to which the resolutions
refer, but the explanations of those views and opm
ions which had already been given to the public
in the other branch of the Legislature, [by Mr
Wright,] rendered it unnecessary for him to
trouble the House at this time
In the exposition of those views and opinions to
which he alluded, Mr M said he was authorized
to believe that a large majority of his colleagues on
this floor fully concur
The resolutions were then read, ordered to be
printed, and laid on the table
Mi SELDEN rose and said that he held in his
hand a memorial from the merchants of New York,
representing the present deranged state of trade
ard currency, and the causes of their derange-
ment
In presenting the memorial he would take occa-
sion to say that it was signed by three fourths of
the commeicial mteiest of the city, ard by three
fourths, in number, of the meichants of the city
He would further suggest that these merchants,
more than any other traders in the Union, were
connected.with the commeru; of tins country In
the last six years they had paid to the Government
more than fifty millions of dollars The signers
of this memorial had paid more than three fourths
of the sum collected in the city of New York, and
more than half of what had been paid by the whole
countiy He would go further and say that the
memorialists had fulfilled their contracts to the
Government from month to month and year to
year, with unexampled punctuality, that they were
not cornected with either of the belligerent parties
of the day, that they were men of no party, but
were deeply interested in every measure connected
with the trade and commerce of the country
They were men upon whose operation'? depended
the successful prosecution of the trade of this coun-
try They speak from piactical knowledge of the
effect of the destruction of the national currency
upon trade Whenever occasions have called for
the exertions of these men for the preservation of
public interests, both in peace and war, they have
not withheld their aid In carrying on a conflict
against their interests, you strike at the very vitals
of trade, for when the centre of commerce was
afflicted, those sections of country which least
expect it will alsa be reached by the distress Let
me ask, sir, whether petitioners like these are not
entitled to the favorable consideration of this House?
whether men whose relations to the Government
are as intimate as our own, when they represent
that they cannot cairy on tiade without the agency
of a national bank, are not entitled to be attentively
heard, and their opinions carefully considered'
He had said that the memoirahsts belonged to no
party, but a large portion of them were friendly
to the present Administration He had looked over
the paper, and was able to say that as large a num-
ber of friends as of opponents of the Administra-
tion had signed it They say that the currency is
in a state of derangement and does not answer the
purposes of business. Mr. S went on to point
out some prominent facts in relation to the effect
of the disturbance upon business At the com-
mencement of the month of September, exchange
on Europe was 10 per cent above par, thus afford-
ing to the producer an advance of 10 per cent on
his nominal prices. But within the last month,
drafts upon London were offered in New York
at 5 per cent discount The relations between
the towns on the Ohio and Mississippi and the
city of New York were such, until recently, that
exchanges could be carried on at the small expense
to the producer of one half of one per cent, but now
it costs the producers from two to five per cent to
effect those exchanges. This «raí an actual draft
upon the industry of the country for the benefit of
broKers and shavers As to the extent of com-
mercial distress, does any one doubt it' I tell
gentlemen that some of the oldest and first estab-
lished houses in this country have failed,and that
this is but the forerunner of greater difficulties
The memorialists were intimately connected with
the local banks of New York, and knew their ca-
pacity for the transaction of business, and yet rep-
resent them as unable to afford any relief What
class of citizens are to be benefited by the present
condition of things' He had heard the poor
spoken of, and it had been said that the bank was
to be destroyed for the benefit of the poor, at the
expense of the rich But was it a fact that the
poor were to be benefited ' The rich men, with
money in their pockets, will not suffer The bank
was for the benefit of enterprise, and poverty,
struggling, with the aid of credit, against the com
petition of wealth
Mr JARVIS here interposed, and asked if the
gentleman from New York was in order
The CHAIR replied, the gentleman is perfectly
m order, if the House is willing to hear him, but
not if any objection is made
Mr. JARVIS then objected, and Mr SELDEN
asked the permission of the fjouse to go on
The House granted leave, and
Mr SELDEN proceeded He was sorry to see
those gentlemen who had been so fully heard on
this subject, now endeavoring to suppress the dis
cussion [The Chair stated that it was not m
order to allude to the course taken by members ]
Mr S adverted to the abolition of credit on duties
Formerly the duties were paid after a credit of
ten or twelvemonths, now they were paid in cash.
At the very moment when this change was made,
it was prepared to put an end to the currency of
the country Who would be the first to suffer'
It might be that the Government itself would be
the first to suffer Instead of prompt and punc-
tual payment of the duties, we may find nothing
but protested bonds in the custom-house It bad
been rumored in the Capitol for some days that
we were to return to a specie currency How were
we to get the specie for the purpose? Send our
local bank paper to Europe for it ? Will our paper
be more current there than here ? But the evils of
the paper system bore no proportion to its profits
The labor and enterprise of this country had been
maintained by credit The vast improvements
which had of late years been made m this country
had been accomplished by bank paper. The
roads, canals, factories, storehouses, &c , which
had sprung up everywhere, were the results of
paper credit It was true that this required regu-
lation, ?nd the memorialists say that'it can only
be regulated by a national bank Mr S went on
to argue that the paper system could only exist m
a free Government It was the offspring of free
institutions Mr S argued at some length to
show the inefficiency of local banks in equalizing
the exchanges of the country But the derange-
ment of the papei system was not so great as to
render it necessary to abandon it The petitions
sent to us from every part of the country do not
exhibit any intention on the part of the people to
abandon the paper system There was nothing in
the lesolutions of the Legislature of the State of
New York or of Ohio which favored the scheme
of abandoning the paper system, and both of these
States were carrying their paper system to a still
greater extent by the establishment of new local
banks But the bank was said to be a political
machine What w as the evidence of th.s charge'
The largest operations of the bank were in New
York and Pennsylvania, but in those States the
