frequent its rooms or are entertained by its members, take place at a building on the corner of Franklin and Charles streets. Departing from the original character and purposes of its institution, this club has for a long time past degenerated into a resort for those who are disaffected toward the Government, hostile to its legally constituted authorities, and who give countenance, encouragement, and aid to the unnatural and causeless rebellion by which our institutions and national integrity are sought to be overthrown. So dangerous and mischievous an association cannot be permitted longer to pursue these practices or maintain this attitude in a loyal community. The Maryland Club is, therefore, suspended, and its house of meeting taken possession of, and closed. The provost-marshal of the Eight Army Corps is charged with then immediate execution of this order. In the execution of the order, the names of all persons found in the building, of all who belong to the association, and of all who habitually frequent it, will be taken, and an inventory will be made of the property and records or papers of the association, and the same held subject to future orders. By command of Major-General Schenck:
