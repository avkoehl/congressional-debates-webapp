Major B. F. FISHER,

A new camp has appeared in rear of Cemetery Hill, and from the style of the tents (A-tents) and the number of them I think it is the same which moved from west of Whitehead's. Ordinary fatigue parties on new works to-day. Two or three small detachments of infantry on different roads and several small trains moving in different directions all the movements noticed in enemy's line.
