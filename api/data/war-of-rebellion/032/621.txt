In another skirmish, on the 24th, we killed another; captured his horse and equipments and revolver. We brought in 6 prisoners, 3 of whom have everything necessary to prove hem bushwhackers, except we could not find their arms.

The result of the scout was 4 killed, 6 prisoners, 17 horses and 1 mule, 13 horse equipments, 6 revolvers, 2 guns, and 1 carbine. The body of the guerrillas seem to be west of us. Captain [M.] Morris, Company A, First Missouri State Militia Cavalry, reports that on the 22nd he surprised Marchbanks on the Double Branches, in Bates County, capturing 18 horses and equipments, 18 guns, their camp equipage, and Marchbanks' private papers.
