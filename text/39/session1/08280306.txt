stop to the immense drain of gold to enrich the
manufacturers of Europe. We now produce
over $2,500,000,000 of manufactures annually
■which consume about $2,000,000,000 of agri-
cultural products in food, raw material, &c.;
yet we are paying the skill and sagacity of the
manufacturers of Europe nearly $100,000,000
annually in gold over and above our exchanges,
value for value; while the manufacturers of
Europe never took more than $80,000,000 of
our agricultural products, exclusive of cotton,
in any one year, and generally considerably
less.
It is said we have incurred a large debt in
consequence of the late war in putting down
the rebellion. True it is, but it is small com-
pared to that of other nations, as the following
will show when we take into consideration our
own resources:
Statement of the different national debts, together with
the population and average amount per capita to each

The following is an estimate of the receipts
and expenditures of the United States Gov-

18C6:

ual $132,871,519 25

mated  36,219,903 52
  133,139,359 90
Total  $520,823,559 00
From this statement it will be seen that the re-
ceipts exceed the expenditures 837,223,395 G8
afterpayment of the interest on the public debt,
and$234,44!),701 82 fortheWar, and $43,304,-
118 52 for the Navy. The large amount of ex-
penditures for the past year was caused by the
payment of the Army and Navy, and as the
greater portion of them are now discharged
that expenditure will be small for the next
fiscal year; consequently a large sum can be
applied to the liquidation of the national debt.
If, Mr. Speaker, our Governmentis properly
and judiciously administered, we will advance
in prosperity and strength. But should those
who have for the past four years been endeav-
oring to destroy this Ilepublic, in council cham-
ber and on fields of battle, be in power and
permitted to mold the destinies of the nation,
we will have a gloomy and foreboding prospect.
There will be no security for life or property—
no permanent faith in the lasting security of
our institutions. The hecatombs that have
strewn the field of carnage or pei-ished in the
prison-pens of the South will all be in vain.
God forbid that the leading rebels should
ever sit in the councils of the nation or par-
ticipate in the affairs of the Government. Go
to Arlington Heights where once the arch-
traitor Lee, who was educated by the United
States, resided, and indulged in all the luxury
the land afforded, and w hat do we see ? Thou-
sands upon thousands of graves containing the
bodies of Union soldiers whose lives this man
directed in destroying, and here and there you
will find a grave marked ■' unknown," but not
unwept. What a satisfaction it would be to
some dear relative to be able to designate the
body which that grave contains; but alas! that
cannot be done ; it can only be recognized by
friends_at the final resurrection. How mor-
tifying it is to every lover of the Union to see
leading rebels who caused so much misery
throughout the land stalking about, bold and
impudent, and even asking to aid in the admin-
istration of the Government!
And now, Mr. Speaker, as we are about to
separate and return to our constituents after
j an arduous session of eight months, it is for
them to say whether they will sustain us in our
efforts to save the country. I am aware that
many demagogues and aspiring politicians find
fault with our proceedings, but I am willing to
submit them to the scrutiny of a candid people.
I assert here, as I will before my constituents,
that I will not vote for the admission of Kepre-
sentatives from any of the States lately in
rebellion which refuse to ratify the late amend-
ment to the Constitution that we have submit-
ted to the respective States, for 1 deem it in-
dispensable for the security and permanency
of our Government. With proper safeguards
thrown around, and a firm reliance in Him in
whose hands alone a country can prosper, this
great nation will endure until time is no more,
and be an asylum for the oppressed of all na-
tions, and not like the ancient republics which
through their luxury and wickedness fell to rise
no more; for, as Mr. Montagu has said—
"Greece, once the nursery of arts and sciences, the
faithful mother of philosophers, lawyers, and authors
now lies prostrate under the iron yoke of ignorance
and barbarism ; Carthage, once thcmiglity sovereign
of the ocean, and the center of universal commerce, c
which poured the riches of the nations into her lap, '
now puzzles the inquisitive traveler in hisiesearches
after even the vestiges of her ruin ; and llome, tho
mistress of the universe, which once contained what-
ever was esteemed great or brilliant in human na-
ture, is now sunk into the ignoble feast of whatever
is esteemed mean and infamous."
