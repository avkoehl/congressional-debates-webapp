Militia. This force will probably cross the Osage in the vicinity of Warsaw. The portion pursued by Colonel Philips passed south between this and Warrensburg last night. Colonels Weer and Lazear, who moved west immediately after the battle of Marshall, managed to get in ahead of Colonel Philips, and took up the pursuit, having fresh horses, Colonel Philips abandoning the pursuit. I have just learned that Hunter was 10 miles east of Cole Camp at 11 this morning, closely pursued by our troops. I arrived here at 3 o'clock this morning, and have ordered all the fresh troops under Colonel Hall in pursuit. I am informed that Jackman, Marchbanks, and Quantrill are in the border counties, and will endeavor to forma junction at some point south of the Osage. Colonel Philips dispatches that the enemy is running like wild hogs, and that [he] has captured all their train and ambulances, and two wagon loads of ammunition.

GENERAL: Major Houts was with me in all my rapid marches pursuing the enemy from Marshall, after his defeat, as long as was necessary, as I had sent a fresh force from here, under Colonel Hall, who has taken up the pursuit. The stragglers and convalescents are not required. Commanding officers of sub-districts are ordered to relieve them.

The operator at Saint Joseph, in the first instance, refused to receive my dispatch to you yesterday morning, and did not forward it last night.

The enemy was 9 miles east of Cole Camp at 11 a. m. yesterday, and Colonel Hall was about two hours behind him. I will be able to relieve General Totten by Sunday.
