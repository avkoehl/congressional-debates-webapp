Suffolk, should no other troops follow I think it probable that this corps is intended to re-enforce their army in South Carolina; but should its real destination be Suffolk, General Pickett's division will be ample to resist it.

I have the honor to be, with great respect, your obedient servant,

General R. E. LEE:

I subjoin a telegram just received from General Pryor; likewise the closing paragraph of a telegram by order of General French, at Goldsborough, calling for large supplies of ammunition. I consider the latter the result of similar intelligence from General Pryor. I doubt the Newport New report. Have you information to determine It? Would you advise delay in sending troops to Charleston from North Carolina?

Two persons from Norfolk Thursday (one a lady and the other a gentlemen), where there had been no concert, inform me that thirty-six regiments landed at Newport News Wednesday. They say it is Hooker's army. Within the past week Suffolk largely re-enforced.

I concluded in my telegram that the James was meant in both places, though it may be well doubted if the York, as first named, was not designed throughout. It matters not, however, as the danger could not be materially different in
