GENERAL ORDERS, HDQRS. DEPT. OF ALA., MISS., AND E. LA., Numbers 114. Meridian, Miss., September 6, 1864.

Pursuant to orders from the War Department, dated Richmond, Va., August 15, 1864, I assume command of the Department of Alabama, Mississippi, and East Louisiana.

R. TAYLOR,Lieutenant-General.

RICHMOND, VA., September 6, 1864.

General R. TAYLOR,

Meridian, Miss.:

General Forrest telegraphed me, on the 5th instant, that, if permitted to select from his present command 4,000 men and six pieces of artillery, he thought he could, in Middle and WEST Tennessee, disturb enemy's communications and recruit his command. If circumstances permit it, I think it would be well to employ him in operations on the enemy's lines of communication, as well as to interfere with the transportation of supplies and re-enforcements to General Sherman's army. Of this you must inform yourself and freely exercise your judgment.

JEFFN. DAVIS.
