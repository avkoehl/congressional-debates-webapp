Your report* was read to-day to the Cabinet, and they were unanimously of opinion that it ought not to be published. The President coincides in that opinion.

The President and Secretary both think that no order in relation to the recent battles should be issued at present. None was issued in regard to McClellan's battles before Richmond. Do not infer from this your best with the material you had. I have not heard any one censure you in the least.

The differences and ill-feeling among the generals are very embarrassing to the administration, and unless checked will ruin the country. It must cease. It is discreditable to all parties. We must all act together or we shall accomplish nothing, but be utterly disgraced.

You know that I am your friend and will never see any injustice done you if I can help it, but there are matters of such great importance to be decided now that individual preferences must yell. We must do what seems best to reconcile the differences which exist in the two armies. I will explain to you more fully as soon as you come over to report.

Yours, truly,

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.

WASHINGTON, D. C., September 5, 1862.

Major-General HALLECK:

SIR: Inclosed please find report in reference to the evacuation of Aquia Creek and the destruction of property. The burning of the wharf, buildings, and bridges I consider to have been unnecessary and highly censurable.

Respectfully submitted.
