Senate.
more lawful than irregular invasions by multi-
tudes of private and unauthorized individuals.
Unquestionably, the duty of this Government is
to prevent all such occutrences.
We, therefore, must set out, in the considera-
tion of such subjects, with the conviction of tins
Uutli, that no State has a right to make war for
jtselt any moie than it has to make war for the
whole country, or, as has been expressed, to drag
the other States into it
These lesolutions were, of course, drawn up
hastily, as time has been short
Mr BUCHANAN. They were not drawn up
in two days
Mr. WEBSTER. I meant a compliment to
the committee, but if gentlemen .reject it, I will
take it back. [Laughter] There may be a state
of things by which Maine may be involved in
hostilities, and shall we then keep hands off'
Shall we neither repress those hostilities, nor
make the war our own, but leave her to fight out
he* own quarrel, in her own way? Sir, what
American statesman can maintain such doctrines?
This cannot be. We must prevent the war, or
can y it on ourselves And we cannot constitu-
tionally declare by a resolution that we will or
will not give her the miluui y aid of this Govet n
merit. I 01 what la implied in that? 1 hat slit
may go on, and mako a little war of her own, in
which we mav or may not take part, as we shall
be advised llus, I repeat, is the constitutional
doetnne, fairly to be infeiicd fiom this lattei
bianch of the icsolution, and I a;mii say that it
is a doctrine which I, for one, repudiate altogcthi r
Maine is not out ally, she is a pait of ourselves
In whatever relates to out foicign iclations, she
has no capacity for scpaiatu action, and can
neither make wat nor mako peace fir herself If
«he is invaded, she may icpel that invasion, and
it will be oui duty to hasten to her aid with all
am power If she be not invaded, the power and
the duty of vindicating hi r rights against fine ign
nations devolve on this Government, and she her-
self, in the mean time, is to kn p the peace
But I have another objection to this icsolution
It scams to cany an imputation against Maine
U implies that tluio is itason tu fi ai that she
may violate her constitutional duty Now 1 am
not dispo«M d thus to censure hoi in adv im e I
will impute to her no sin h pmpnsi Whuc is
tin 11 any c villi me that she "dctctmiiies to si tilo
the lOiilrovcisy for herself by foici," or that shi
11 likely to lump to any such determination'
1 bus fai she has made no such atti nipt Why,
then, should we rebuke her befoichantl ? Why
suppose a case, and that a veiy improbable oni,
for no purpose but that of saying that, should it
happen, we will reject her, and cast her oft'
This icproa.cn in advance is unnecessaiy and
ungust
Why is it not enough to say, sir, that we will
support the peace of tho United States, that wi
will protect the interests of all the members of
the Union, and vindicate their rights to the soil,
that when there shall be a necessity for war, it
shall be declared and waged by the whole power
of this Government, but that, while thcie is
peace, it shall be maintained by this Govern
ment' Sir, I repeat ogam, that theie can be no
possible state of things in which this iisolution
would be constitutional and just If theie is an
invasion of Maine, she may repel it, and we must
support her, and if Maine invade her peaceable
neighbors with hostile forces, it is our duty to be
there and prevent such invasion
Sir, I concur cordially in the peaceful spirit of
these resolutions, I would not hold out encour-
agement to acts which might implicate the peace
oj the country Butthe case made in this foui th
lesolution is not actual, it is all supposititious
Maine has, as yet, done nothing which ought to
be tegarded as hostile. Why, then, shall we
presume that she will not still do her duty ' Is
it not a matter of proper respect to the State to
Uke it for grimed that, without an admomlion
or a rebuke fiom us, she will confine herself to
those defensive measures which eveiybody knows
she may rightfully exercise' She has manliest
cd no disposition to maintain exclusive jnusdic-
tion by militaty occupation, yet that is just the
predicament in winch thi3 resolution supposes
she may hereafter place herself   But why get up
a supposed ease, in order to chide her, and to
threaten her with being left to her fate' I should
be glad, Mr President, to be able to vote for all
the resolutions, but I cannot vote for the last,
unless this latter clause be stncken out
Mr BUCHANAN said Since these resolu-
tions have been met with extraordinary objec-
tions, I will make a few observations furtiiei
This body is truly the conservative body of the
country, and we aie not to be deterred, through
fear of giving offense, from marching forward in
the course of our duty
It appears to me that some of the arguments of
Senatois must of necessity involve the country
in wai, not a war of the whole country, but a
wai brought on we know not how nor why
What is the position of tho Senator from Missis
sippi and of the two Senators from Massachu
setts?   It is, that this is the territory of Maine,
and therefore we are to go to war forthwith   They
suppoit Maine in the occupation of this territory,
and let that proposition be adopted here, and the
negotiation is ended, and then war is the imme-
diate and inevitable result
But has the negotiation ended? I admit there
has been long delay But has not the Bulish
Minister told us th it be expects a speedy settle
mentof the mum question ' Butil the negotiation
has eiuled, evciy Senator knows that war is the
untile diuli result Senatois nio wiong on this
suhjtel Plus elisput d teiritoty lias nceer been
in the possession of Maine She nevei held it
Ihis has bein a vexed question evci since the
treaty of 17&3, anil since the rejection of the
award ot the lung of Holland, it has, on oui pait,
bee nuodei the coutiol of the tieaty making powet
ol this Government, and Maine has not the light
to the exclusive possession ot the teirituiy einy
more than laigland It is wilhdiawn fiom the
juusdielton of both scveially, and is under the
lointjuiisdictionol this Gove inmentanil rngland,
lor the purposo oi settling tho contioversy But
if this is the tirutoiy ol Muni, and we nic at
once to maintain foi hei its possession, then the
negotiation is i titled, and w iuc ahead y in a st ite

nfltui, has acted with caution and funniest lie

aie excited to the hi lust pitch, and, il uc {,0

Itisallegid that n fou oof foui ni five thousand
men, under the command of Sn John Harvey, is
| cum e minting at the mouth of the Aroostook, and
that he  has given notice to the  land  agent of
I Maine that, ui less his mm should tlispeise, he
' would duvi them away, and the haidy fieenien
ofllmtStnti nic tallying t> the lcsiuc All this
the President looks at boldly and calmly, with i
. fixed dctei mi nation to suppoit Maine against sue h
an unjust attack, but, having been placed in a
position ol exalted eminence by the pi ople of the
whole countiy, whcie duty requites him to stand
I nbm the e \eilcd feelings so natural to the single
Stat directly nucleated m the contest, and to
view the question in lis healings upon the wholi
Union, he says that, if Sn Tohn llaivcy should
withthaw his forces, he will not, in that event,
leel hiinse If bound to send the loices of the Uni
ted States to the suppoit of Maine, should she
determine to settle the contioveisy for herself by
aims
This territory has never been consideied for a
moment, fiom 1783 till now, as a pait of Maine,
and when we pledge otnsi Ives to stand by Mime
to the death, is it unkind or unconstitutional foi
us to adopt the last clmse of the fouith nsolu
lion'   The Senile in tint do not sty that, eien
i if Maine should d > wiong, a contingi ncj might
arise m which vvc vv iuld not tu-.h to hei icscue
j We could not say that, ilthough it vv mid have
been constitutional to d i so, but v e vv nit to tell
Maine that wi tuc not undii a cinstitutional ob
ligation to aid her if she take [ osscssion of the
disputed temtoiy by her own iorce And wc i! i
not require of her even a simultaneous mthdiai ai
but the British are to withdraw fust, and we say,
if they do that, as I hope they will, then we are
under no constitutional obligation to sustain
Maine m the possession of the territory, if she
choose to attempt it by force
Sir, much as I deprecate war, yet I more dread
dishonor, and if Sir John Harvey peisist in car-
rying his threat into execution, the Senate pledge
themselves to war And if we strike out the
fouith resolution, and send the other three to
Maine, with the speeches of the two Senators
fiom Massachusetts and the Senator from Mis
sissippi, we shall be at war before a fortnight
And if we say to Maine, with the Senator fiom
Ohio, [Mr Allen,] we will suppoit you, light
or wrong, sir, we shall then be governed by her
impulses, we shall be led asttay by the enthu-
siasm of Maine For her I am prepared to go
to war. But I wish to do it under such con-
ditions that there can be no dispute about the
justice of our cause. And I am not willing to
conclude this proceeding without expressing to
Maine our decision that the question is exclu-
sively with us, and not with her As it regards
mere modifications of the resolutions, I am in
favor of them as far as they can aid in effecting
unanimity Hutas far as the pimeiple is con
cemed—that t question is ouis—that I cannot
abandon, and on thatl had ti usted and confidently
hoped that wc should have unanimity in the Sen-
ate
Mr DAVIS said I will add but a woid of ex-
planation The giound taken by the Senator
fiom Pennsylvania represents me as saying the
negotiation is at an end Now, all I desue is,
that tho Senate may know how and why I siid
it I said it hat! been at an end, and it was so
deel tied, both by this and the Butish Govern-
ment, but I did not say that it could not be le-
nevved I said also, that Great Britain had de
patted fiom the onginal undeislanding, (of not
e \ti tiding jurisdiction,) because she consideud
it as no longei binding and, taking still highci
gioundjshi chimed lot heistlf the sole oecu
nincy of the dispute it temtoiy And this cl um

that if a Stttc is invaded, it is then both the ri^ht
