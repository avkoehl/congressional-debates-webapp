Chadsey, provost-marshal-general, Second District of Rhode Island, has been holding communication with His Excellency the Governor of Rhode Island without your knowledge, and inclosing copy of your order of the 3rd instant to Captain Chadsey relative thereto, the Provost-Marshal-General directs me to state that he does not know the facts or circumstances under which the order was made, and therefore he cannot judge of its necessity, but presumes you had sufficient cause.
