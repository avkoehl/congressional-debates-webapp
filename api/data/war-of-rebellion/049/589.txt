Major-General MEADE,

Commanding Army of the Potomac:

My attention has been called by the War Department to the difficulty and expense of foraging so large a number of animals in the Army of the Potomac, and it is suggested whether a part of the cavalry cannot be sbusisted in the Shenandoah Valley on the enemy, or some portion of the animals be sent where food can be supplied at less expense. I submit the matter for your consideration.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.

DECEMBER 29, 1863-8.45 p.m.

General French reports that his picket officer reports the enemy's pickets on the Sperryville road, and that a reconnointering party of the enemy was also observed. Is one of your brigades on that road? Have you pickets and patrols on it? The major-general commanding directs that you send out immediately and ascertain what force of the enemy are there.
