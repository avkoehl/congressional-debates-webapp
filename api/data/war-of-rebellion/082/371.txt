HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS, July 21, 1864.

General WILLIAMS:

General Bartlett was colonel of the Fifty-seventh Massachusetts, in our First Division, and was wounded in the Wilderness. Whilst away he was appointed brigadier-general, and as this corps was a separate command when he left he reported direct on his return, which was a mistake. He will report to-morrow as soon as I can reach him. I have learned that the Captain Amory to whom I referred is in the Tenth Corps, so we cannot get him.

HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS, July 21, 1864-9 p. m.

General WILLIAMS:

There has been to-day great activity on the part of the enemy in front of my Second and Third Divisions digging and strengthening their line. While I am not disposed to ask for additional troops on the line, I beg to remind the commanding general of the statement made to him last night in reference to that portion of the line occupied by General Willcox, our extreme left. It is a single line and our troops are growing very weary; they would not resist an attack with the same vigor that they would have done a week ago. The indications all pointing to an attack by the enemy upon my front, if any attack is made by them, I beg to suggest that a portion of the Second Corps should be moved to within supporting distance of our position, or at any rate should be held in readiness to move to our support.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS, July 21, 1864.

General WILLIAMS:

If it is wished, General Bartlett will be directed to report to your headquarters for assignment. At the time he left the corps for a wound received at the Wilderness, the corps had not been attached to the Army of the Potomac. I should like to have him, as he is one of our old colonels. He will take the command of the brigade formerly commanded by General Stevenson, who was killed at Spotsylvania. The Captain C. B. Amory for whom he applied was appointed for General Stevenson, but did not receive his appointment until after that general's death. He will, if assigned to General Bartlett, serve with the brigade to which it was originally intended he should be attached. It was thought that Captain Amory would report at your headquarters to-day.

A. E. BURNSIDE,Major-General.

If General Bartlett has received his appointment since he left your corps, I suppose on returning to duty now he should, under General
