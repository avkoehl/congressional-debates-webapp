that Cairo is in the Northern Department, and that General Canby's command extends to the mouth of Ohio River. General Orders, Numbers 49, War Department, series of 1864, place Cairo, III., in the Department of the Tennessee. No order has yet been received attaching it to the Northern Department, hence it was understood to be transferred to this division when the posts east of the Mississippi were so transferred. Cairo is the point of concentration for troops coming into this command and of distribution for those going out, and it seems necessary that I should exercise some supervision over it.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ED. R. S. CANBY,

Major-General, Commanding.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF WEST MISSISSIPPI,Near Orleans, La., January 17, 1865.

Admiral LEE,

Commanding Mississippi Squadron, Mound City, Ill.:

ADMIRAL: The concentration of rebel troops on Red River appears not to be for the purpose I anticipated, and I see no present objection to vessels going up that River for the purpose of procuring cotton. I purpose to approve safe-conducts for that purpose, and advise their approval by you. I will immediately notify you of any change.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ED. R. S. CANBY,

Major-General, Commanding.

P. S. - In order to save time and expenses to parties holding permits, I think it will not be improper to delegate to the commander of the naval district at the mouth of Red River to approve the safe-conducts that have been approved by me. In the case of my own absence I will delegate this authority to the commander of this department, who will be advised of any reasons for withholding the approval.

E. R. S. C.

Captain J. J. CORNWELL, U. S. Navy,

Commanding District, Mississippi Squadron,

U. S. steamer Choctaw, off Donaldsonville, La.:

CAPTAIN: There are a number of plantations on or in the immediate neighborhood of the Mississippi River which are cultivated by freed labor, under the orders of the commander of the Department of the Gulf, who have heretofore been permitted to ship their products and receive their under article 38 of the Treasury regulations of July 29, 1864. Their cases are covered by military orders, and I supposed by Admiral Lee's Order, Numbers 9, of November 10, 1864. I learn to-day that there is difficulty about landing supplies or shipping products at points on the River above Donaldsville. Will you do me the favor to examine into this matter and permit products to be shipped and plantation supplies to be landed when the permits are given or approved by the provost-marshal-general of the Department of the Gulf?

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ED. R. S. CANBY,

Major-General, Commanding.
