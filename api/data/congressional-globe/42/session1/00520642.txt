THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
April 13,
men, we speak of it. We are called upon to
do this because of our proximity to the local-
ity in question. We would be derelict in duty
were we to fail to impress the great importance
of this question upon those who, from their
distance from the scene, are not supposed to
fully comprehend its magnitude at first view.
Besides the resolution of our Legislature, we
feel it is only required of us to ask gentlemen
to reflect upon the admitted perils to every
great interest of life and commerce to con-
vince them that it would be a reproach to
reject or postpone this appropriation.
There is no opportunity, as has been sug-
gested, for plunder or corruption or fraud.
The expenditure is excellently guarded by
every provision of law. Proper officers of the
Government superintend the expenditure, and
the public interests will be effectually pro-
tected. By this expenditure individuals will
be protected from unnecessary risks upon the
coast, and commerce will enjoy a great advan-
tage in being secured in some measure against
perils which are famous the world over.
Mr. DAWES. I wish to state briefly the
views of the committee upon this subject, upon
which they were unable to submit a report
recommending either concurrence or non-con-
currence. The sum proposed to be appropri-
ated is very large, $200,000. The provision
is framed in the most general terms, with no
indication of the mode of expenditure and
no limitation in that direction. It is in this
general language:
That for the purpose of more effectually securing
life and property on the coast of New Jersey for the
fiscal year ending June 30,1S72, $203,000,
The object, however, for which this appro-
priation is intended is one about which it is
impossible for any of us to be indifferent.
Whatever expenditure of money may be neces-
sary to contribute to the safety of life upon
the Jersey shore or any other shore will, so far
jis consistent with our duties to all other parts
of the country, be cheerfully expended. But
it is proper for us to see what we are doing in
this direction, how we are spending money for
this purpose, and whether it can be expended
as efficiently upon this coast, taking in view its
danger, as we are able to expend it in connec-
tion with other dangerous coasts. All this,
it seems to me, must properly be considered
in acting upon this question.
The amendment which I propose will bring
this expenditure under the provisions of ex-
isting law. If the amendment be adopted this
appropriation will be expended in the manner
we are expending other money for similar pur-
poses. The life-stations upon that coast, as
we are informed by the Secretary of the Treas-
ury, are now located at intervals of five miles.
It is proposed by this expenditure to double
the number, so that there shall be one life-
station for every two and a half miles. We
have made appropriations from year to year
for the support of fifty-four station-keepers
upon the Jersey and Long Island coasts. The
annual appropriation for contingencies has
been ยง15,000; and there were added in the
House, upon an eloquent argument of the gen-
tleman from New York, [Mr. Cox,] who has
spoken again to-day, ยง10,000, making $25,000
for current expenses.
We before, by a large outlay, erected these
fifty-four life-saving stations. I was informed
by the Secretary, if the keepers of these stations
or those who superintend them have spent the
money, none of them have suggested that there
wasanyneedofdoublingthem, orofanyfurther
expenditure there. The attention of those
having them in charge has been directed to the
dangerous coast of North Carolina, in order to
see whether something could not be done down
there. They are desirous of doing all that is
necessary here. If the necessity is greater here,
if this coast is more dangerous than that ot'
North Carolina, it should be expended here. 11
is proper for us to consider, however, whether
it had not better be postponed to the next fiscal
year when the attention of the proper author-
ities will have been called to it to see whether
they concur in it or not.
It originated in a resolution of the Legisla-
ture of New Jersey, and not in any Departmen t
of the United States Government having charge
of the matter. The Legislature of New Jersey
passed resolutions instructing their Senators
and requesting their Representatives on both
sides of the House to advocate this measure,
and they have shown commendable zeal to se-
cure this appropriation. The amendment pro-
poses to extend the appropriation of $200,000
to the coast of Long Island as well as to the
New Jersey coast.
Mr. COX. What is the recommendation of
the Treasury Department?
Mr. DAWES. I have a letter from the Sec-
retary of the Treasury which says that he thinks
this thing ought to have more careful exam-
ination. In that letter he suggests the amend-
ment which I have sent to the Clerk's desk.
I do not understand him to say that he opposes
it, because he has not had opportunity to
examine the matter, nor does he recommend
it, for the same reason. He suggests, inas-
much as they have not proper information, it
should be postponed for the present. For the
same reason the committee make this sugges-
tion.
Mr. BURCHARD. Do I understand the
gentleman from Massachusetts to say that there
is an appropriation for the present fiscal year ?
Mr. DAWES. There was an appropriation
reported by the committee for the support of
these fifty-four stations of $15,000, that is, for
contingent expenses, and to that an appropri-
ation of $10,000 was added in the House on
motion of the gentleman from New York,
[Mr. Cox.]
Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I merely wish to
state, in reply to what has been said by the
gentleman from Massachusetts, that it did
not originate in the New Jersey Legislature
alone, but, on the contrary, was recommended
by the chief of the revenue marine in his
report to the Secretary of the Treasury in
December last, the commissioners of pilotage,
and by the superintendent of the stations, who
had especial charge of all these matters along
the coast. They reported to the Legislature
that these life-saving boats were worn out,
that the stations themselves were out of repair,
that, indeed, everything was out of order, and
that it was absolutely necessary, in order to
make the service efficient upon the coast, that
there should be a new appropriation for the
purpose of supplying new life-saving appa-
ratus. The matter was investigated. Resolu-
tions were introduced and passed both houses
unanimously, calling the attention of Congress
to the subject and asking for the appropria-
tion. I would further remark that the stations
were intended to be five miles apart, as stated
by the gentleman from Massachusetts, but, as
I am informed, are about seven miles distant
from each other.
The amendment of Mr. Dawes to the amend-
ment was agreed to ; and the Senate amend-
ment, as amended, was then concurred in.
The SPEAKER. The amendments in which
the committee have recommended concurrence
with amendments have been gone through with,
and we come now to the third class of amend-
ments of the Senate, in which the committee
have recommended non-concurrence.
Mr. CONGER. Before we come to those
amendments I desire to offer an amendment
to section one, and after it has been read, sa
it will go into the Globe to-morrow, I will move
that the House adjourn.
Mr. COOK. 1 ask unanimous consent to
correct a date in the amendment adopted on
ray motion yesterday. Instead of June 21,
1870, it should be July 15, 1870.
There was no objection, and the correction
was ordered to be made.
Mr. DAWES. The committee have modi-
fied their report, recommending concurrence
instead of non concurrence in the sixiy-second
amendment of the Senate, as follows:
Sec. 32. That $3,000 in appropriated, out of which
sum shall be paid to John Thompson Mason, late
collector of the portol Baltimore, for services ren-
dered in the disbursement of the light-house fund,
for light-house purposes, and for services performed
outside the limits of his collection district, as the
Secretary of the Treasury may find legally due and
owing tosaid party on an adjustment of his accounts
by the Treasury Depar tin en t.
Mr. CONGER. I have the floor, and I ask
the Clerk to read my amendment.
The Clerk read as follows:
Insert at the end of line forty-one, page 3, the fol-
lowing at the end of section one:
And beit further enacted, That the Secretary of the
Treasury is hereby authorized to graduate the cler-
ical force in the office of the Second Comptroller to
the requirements of the public service, and to allow
extra compensation to such clerks in said office hav-
ing discretionary powers, as may be recommended
by the head thereof; and that the pay of the Second
Comptroller shall, from and after July 1,1871, be the
same as that of the First Comptroller: Provided.
That the entire expenditure for the support of said
office shall not exceed the amount already appropri-
ated by law for that purpose. And the pay of the
First Comptroller of the Treasury and of the Regis-
ter of the Treasury shall be 84,500 each, from and
after the 30th day of June, 1871, and a sufficient sum
to pay any increase of salary herein provided i3
hereby appropriated.
Mr. DAWES. Before the House proceeds
to consider that amendment I desire its atten-
tion to two amendments of the Senate on
which the committee desire to change their
recommendation upon information which has
been presented to them since they made their
report to the House. One of these is the sixty-
second amendment, in which the committee
recommend concurrence.
Mr. FARNSWORTH. What has become
of the amendment which has just been read ?
The SPEAKER. It is considered to be
pending. The Clerk will report the sixty-sec-
ond amendment of the Senate, in which the
committee recommend concurrence.
The Clerk read as follows:
That 83,000 is appropriated, out of which such sum
shall be paid to John Thompson Mason, late col-
lector of the port of Baltimore, for services ren-
dered in the disbursement of the light-house fund,
for light-house purposes, and for services per-
formed outside the limits of his collection district,
as the Secretary of the Treasury may find legally
due and owing to said party on an adjustment of
his accounts by the Treasury Department.
Mr. PERCE. I move to amend by adding
the following:
That there be appropriated out of any money in
the Treasury not otherwise appropriated the sum of
$12,000, or so much thereof as may be necessary,
for the payment of two and one half per cent,
commission upon the disbursements of United
States funds by collectors of customs, acting as
superintendents of lights, during the year ending
June30,1871: Provided, That no commission shall be
paid collectors of customs, whose compensation or
fees as such collector shall exceed $-400 per annum.
Mr. DAWES. I raise the point of order on
that amendment.
The SPEAKER. The Chair sustains the
point of order.
Mr. PERCE. Is not the amendment I have
offered germane to the amendment of the
Senate ?
The SPEAKER. The Chair thinks it is
not. The amendment of the Senate is for the
relief of a particular individual. The amend-
ment of the gentleman from Mississippi [Mr.
Perce] proposes to enact a general provision
of law.
Mr. PERCE. But a provision of law apply-
ing to individuals.
The SPEAKER. It is'not in order under
the rules of the House. โข
Mr. PERCE. Is the amendment proposed
by the gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr.
Dawes] in order?
The SPEAKER. The amendment in which
concurrence is moved by the gentleman from
Massachusetts is an amendment coming from
the Senate. It would not be in order except
as a Senate amendment. But coming from
the Senate no point of order can be made on it.
The Senate amendment, was concurred in.
Mr. DAWES. The other amendment of the
