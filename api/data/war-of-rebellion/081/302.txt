FLAG-SHIP MALVERN,

Farrar's Island, June 21, 1864-11 p.m.

(Received 6.30 p.m. 22d)

Honorable GIDEON WELLES,

Secretary of the Navy:

About noon enemy opened fire from Howlett's battery, and from his iron-clads and gun-boats which were concealed from view above Dutch Gap. Saugus' deck before turret was injured by one 10-inch shot. A number of 1-inch iron plates required immediately to protect weak and cover wounded places; also spare screws for 15-inch guns. The enemy seems determined to control this part of the river. Instead of withdrawing the Tecumseh it is necessary to largely increase the iron-clad force here.

S. P. LEE,

Actg. Rear-Admiral, Commanding North Atlantic Blockading Squadron.

POINT LOOKOUT, June 21, 1864.

(Received 2 p.m.)

Major-General BUTLER:

General Gillmore is here to see prisoners from Petersburg. I refused permission. He has telegraphed to Washington for leave to see them.

M. P. BUFFUM,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding District of Saint Mary.

[Indorsement.]

General GRANT:

What action shall I take in this matter, if any? General Gillmore refuses to demand a court of inquiry, and yet is preparing his case.

BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Major-General.
