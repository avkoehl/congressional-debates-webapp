Tne House had now reached the contingency
contemplated in the proposition of Mr. Stanton.
It had exhausted the three votings therein pro-
Tided for, without a result, and had amved at
that point where, in fulfillment of the agreement
entered into between the two parties, a Speaker
Was to be elected by a plurality vote.
The most intense interest was manifested in
every part of the Hall.
The roll was then called the sixty-third and last
time; Mr. Yenable, of Worth Carolina, one of the
tellers, checking the votes, and announcing, in a
distinct and audible voice, as a vote was added to
the name of Mr. Wjnthrop or Mr. Cobb, the
aggregate number of votes which either had re-
ceived.
[When the name of Mr. J. Cabljs was called,
that gentleman rose and said: Under protest, 1
vote for Howell Cobb ]
[When the name of Mr. Harlan was called,
Mr. H. rose, and was understood to say that from
conversations he had heard on this itoor, from
personal conversations, and from a knowledge of
the qualifications of the two gentlemen, he inclined
to the belief that, as n was now reduced to a cer-
tainty that one of the two would be elected, it
would be safe for him to cast his vote for Howell
Cobb. He therefore did so.]
The roll was called for the sixty-third time,
when the telleis repoited that the whole number
of votes given in was 221; of which—
Mr. H Cobb received   r..--lG2

When the names had been read by the Clerk, a
slight murmur of approbation, not amounting to a
distinct expression, parsed over parts of the Hall.
Mr. LlTTLEFiELD expressed the hope that
no evidences of exultation would be exhibited.
The aggregate re.-.ult was now announced by
Mr. Van Dyke on the part of the tellers—who
added that Howell Cobb having received 302
votes, had received the largest number cast for any
gentleman for whom votes; had been given.
Mr. STANLY rose and paid: I have risen to
offer a resolution to consummate the work of or-
ganization, which I trust in God is now so near its
completion. I therefore send to the Clerk's table
this resolution.
The galleries now broke out into loud applause.
A demand was made that they should be cleared.
The Clerk announced that an order to clear the
galleries would be given, if the disorder was re-
peated.
The resolution of Mr. Stanly was then read in
the following words;
Resolvd, That the Hon. Howell Cobb, a Representative
from the State of Geoiaia, be declared duly elected Speaker
of the House for llie Thnty-fir t Congress.
The resolution having been read—
Mr. ROOT said, I desire the cjues-tkm t«>be taken
by yeas and nays.
Mr. STANLY. Well, sirj agreed.
The Clerk stated the question to be on ordering
the yeas and nays.
[Greatconfusion in the Hall.]
The Cl&rk put the q e9t}ons and declared thai
the yeas and nays had' been ordered by the House.
The Clerk proceeded to call the roll, and one
or two members had answered to the r names,
when—
Mr. SCHENCIC interposed wiih she remark, I
say that Howell Cobb is now the Speaker of this
House by its own order and action, withoat any
resolution.
Mr. ROOT (at the same time in another part of
the Hall) was declaring thaty in this eleetion, a gre £
constitutional principle had been violated by a plu-
rality voie, and that he desired his dissent to be
placed on recoid. Be wished to record his vote—
let other gentlemen record theirs.
[The confusion was very great.]
The Cleric still proceeded wuh the call of the
yeas and nays.
Mr. SCHENCK repeated, in a loud voice, that
a Speaker had been elected by the order of the
House, and that the Clerk hud no right there
callmg the roll until the Speaker was ir> the chair,
[Great disorder, and cries u Go on with the
roll."]
The call of the roll having been at length corri-
pleted, the vote was announced as follows: yeas
149, nays 34:

So the resolution was adopted.
The Clerk then read the resolution, an-1 request-
ed Mr. VVin'throp of Massachusetts and Mr. Mc-
Dowell of Virginia to conduct the Speaker to the
chair.
The two gentlemen designated proceeded to dis-
charge this duty, Mr. Wsnthropapproaching Mr.
Cobb with much good humor, and shaking hands
cordially with him.
Mr. Cobb was thereupon conducted to the chair
and took his seat.
After a moment's pause, the Speaker rose an(3
addressed the House ay follows:
Gentlemen of the House of Representatives:
it would be useless to duguise the fact that I
feel deeply embirrassed in taking this chair under
the circumstances attending; my election.
I am conscious of the difficulties by which this
position is surrounded at the present time.
The peculiar organization of this body, as ex-
hibited in our pioceeding.s since we first met—the
nature and character of the various important and
exciting questions of public policy which will en-
gage our attention during the present session of
Congress—conspire to render the duties of the
