Major-General SHERMAN:

Your views in reference to the maisl are all that could be wished and will insure the best arrangements the army have ever had. With regular communications such as you suggest, if the army is not satisfactorily supplies, it will be my fault. I have now all facilities in the way of clerks. I will go over the route with General Easton's officer and carry out your views.

Major General W. T. SHERMAN, U. S. Army, &amp;c.:

GENERAL: We arrived here from Murfreesborough last night, all right. Colonel Sumner did not get to Weldon, there being too large a force there. He cut the railroad-the Seabord and Roanoke-near Seabord, however, destroying about a mile. The Third New York Cavalry, which has been on a raid on the north side of the Meherrin, have joined us here, and gone back to Suffolk. I shall keep vessels here for a week or so, in case any more troops wish to cross. The First New York stopped about twenty-four hours in Mufreesborough. I can go up to Murfreesborough any time you wish, if I have a vew troops to hold an ugly bluff there is below the town. The only rebels inthis part of the country appear to be on the Weldon railroad and at Weldon, where they keep about 2,000 in intrenchments which are on this side the Roanoke.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. H. MACOMB,

Commander, Commanding.
