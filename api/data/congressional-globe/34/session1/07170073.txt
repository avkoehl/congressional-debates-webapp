DESKS OF SENATORS.
Mr. SEWARD. Mr. President, at this time,
when there is very little business before the Sen-
ate, I wish to bring to the consideration of its
members, not now or immediately, but during the
recess of Congress and such longer time as they
shall see fit, an idea which has occurred to me,
and which I think would be calculated, if carried
into effect, to expedite the transaction of the pub-
lic business, and to improve in all respects the
conduct of debate m the Senate. I offer this res-
olution:
Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate cau<e the
de^ks appropriated to the a e oi the membejs to be removed
lioni the Senate Chamber.
I do not ask for its consideration now. Let it
lie over.
EXECUTIVE SESSION.
On motion of Mr. WELLER, the Senate pro-
ceeded to the consideration of cxccutivc business;
and, after some time spent therein, the doors wore
reopened, and the Senate adjourned.

peal to their charity. 1 wish to make a state-
ment in connection with the business of the

man from New York that, as this is not objection

withdraw the motion. I wish to present a privil-
eged question.

tion in the reported proceedings of Saturday

nation.

So the House refused to adjourn.
The SPEAKER. The question now recurs
on the motion of the gentleman from New York,
[Mr. Haven,] that the House resolve itself into
the Committee of the Whole House on the Pri-
vate Calendar.
Mr. FAULKNER. I ask leave to introduce a
resolution.
Mr. ETHERIDGE. I object.
Mr. RARKSDALE. I moVo that when the
House adjourns to-day, it adjourn to meet on
Monday next.
Several Members. Say Tuesday next.
Mr. CLINGMAN. Is it in order to amend
the motion by inserting Tuesday instead of Mon-
day ?
The SPEAKER. It is hardly in order to move
apnvile^d motion as an amendment.
Mr. CLINGMAN, Then will not a motion
to adjourn unnl Tuesday next—that being the
longest day—take precedence of the other?
The SPEAKER. It will not.
Mr. 15ARKSDALE. At the request of gen-
tlemen all around me, I modify my motion, and
move that when the House adjourns to-day, it
adjourn to meet on Tuesday next.
Mr. ETHERIDGrE. I demand the veas and
nays.
The veas and nays wore ordered.
Mr. SMITH, of Virginia. The motion to
adjourn until Monday next has been already sub-
mitted and defeated, and I would inquire whether
its repetition is in order?
The SPEAKER. Other business has inter-
vened, and the motion is in order.
Mr. IIAVEN. Since the motion to adjourn
until Tucsdcij" next was negatived, no business
has intervened with the exception of motions to
adjourn, and to adjourn until Monday next; and
1 would inquire whether the motion to adjourn
until Tuesday next is now in order?
The SPEAKER. It is. Since the motion was
made there has been, besides motion's to adjourn,
and to adjourn until Monday next, a motion to
go into the Committee of the Whole House on
the Private Calendar,
Mr. IIAVEN. I think the Chnir is right. I
would suggest, then, that wc hod better go into
a Committee of the Whole House, and take up
private bill?:.
Mr. WHEELER. T object to debato.
Mr. DUNN. Is it in order to insert in tho
resolution to adjourn over, after the word " re-*
solved," the words, " the Senate concurring,"
and instead of "Tuesday," the " Thursday be-
fore the fii\st Monday in December next?"
The SPEAKER. It. is not in order.
The question was taken; and it was dccidedin
