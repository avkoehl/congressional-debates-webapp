through the enemy would perhaps attempt a landing above us, and being nearer to Wilmington than me, make a forced march to the city, and at the same time run their boats up the river. To prevent this and to learn their movements more fully I thought it best to send Lipscomb's cavalry and two pieces of artillery to Masonsborough last night. The lights were all extinguished on the fleet last night about 11 o'clock. I think there is some movement on hand. No boats have attempted to come up the river.

Very respectfully, yours,

R. F. HOKE,
