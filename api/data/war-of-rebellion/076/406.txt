HEADQUARTERS LEFT WING, SIXTEENTH ARMY CORPS, Near Atlanta, Ga., August 6, 1864.

Brigadier General J. M. CORSE,Commanding Second Division:

General Ransom and the Seventeenth Army Corps are moving into the new line by direction of the department commander. Have your line finished up as soon as possible. I think Welker's battery better remain in its present position. I have ordered Ransom to throw a regiment on his left, facing north, connecting his left with the main line occupied by you. I will be out this p.m. and see if we cannot in some manner shorten the line. Strengthen the new line as much as possible.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. M. DODGE,

Major-General, Commanding.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI, In the Field, near Atlanta, Ga., August 6, 1864.

Major-General DODGE:

DEAR SIR: Yours of this date is received. I know nothing of General A. J. Smith's assignment to the command of the Sixteenth Corps. Among a batch of special orders received from Washington was one assigning Major John Hough to duty, with General A. J. Smith as commanding the Sixteenth Corps. It may be as commanding that part of the corps on the Mississippi, where the records still are. This is all any one knows about it. General Grant supposed you would succeed General Hurlbut, but I know nothing further that the above. I take pleasure in saying you have ever done your whole duty with zeal and fervor.

With respect, &amp;c.,W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI, In the Field, near Atlanta, August 6, 1864.

General McARTHUR,

Marietta:

You may order the bridge at Roswell to be burned, and draw in the regiment of infantry and cavalry now there; the river being fordable, there is no use in having detachment out exposed.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

KINGSTON, August 6, 1864.

Captain L. M. DAYTON,

Aide-de-Camp:

There are several small bodies of enemy's cavalry hovering on our line watching an opportunity to burn bridges and trains, but I think I can take care of them. Everything right,and going on well. Will go as far as the Chattahoochee with permission.

JAMES B. STEEDMAN,

Major-General.
