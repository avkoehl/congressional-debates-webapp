whom we took trying to pass through our lines says it was asserted in Fayette that Lee had joined Wise, and that they were this side of Lewisburg as far as Meadow Mountain, with 12,000 men moving this way. I have sent two companies of infantry to Fayette and one up the turnpike to reconnoiter. My report of ammunition will reach you so late that I would urge that a considerable quantity of fixed ammunition of all sorts for both the smooth and rifled cannon be sent here We ought to have two or three howitzers. For any continued defense we should need larger additions to our ammunition for small-arms. This has been got from Columbus, but the transportation has been slow. We use caliber .57 (Enfield) and .69 (smooth-bore muskets).

GAULEY BRIDGE, August 12, 1861.

General ROSECRANS,

Clarksburg, Va.:

The party sent up New River report that it is Floyd who is said to be at Lewisburg re-enforcing Wise. The rumors are not thoroughly sifted, and the party will not return till somethin more definite is learned. The force is probably much exaggerated, as usual. We find the workmen upon the flat-boats slower than we expected. They can turn out one boat in two days, and it will take eight or ten days to finish the requisite number for the bridge. The Virginia companies (four) at Point Pleasant say there are rumors of an intended rescue of some prisoners they hold. The country below there is much distrubed by fears.
