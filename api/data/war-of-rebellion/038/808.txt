Vicksburg, May 1, 1863.

JEFFERSON DAVIS, Richmond:

General Bowen has just reported to me that he has fallen back behind Bayou Pierre. He considered it indispensable to his safety. He will endeavor to hold it until re-enforcements arrive. I am now cut off from telegraphic communication with Grand Gulf and Port Gibson.

J. C. PEMBERTON.

Vicksburg, May 1, 1863.

General COOPER, Richmond, Va.:

General Bowen still holds his position, but thinks he will have to retire this side of Bayou Pierre under cover of night. I urge him not to do so, unless indispensable to his safety. Have full confidence in his judgment. A large amount of bacon which was in Port Gibson has been removed to Grand Gulf. No further demonstration from force of enemy in Chickasaw Bayou.

J. C. PEMBERTON.

If this is true, I must have heavy re-enforcements. Please answer immediately.

I have no re-enforcements to send him. If these raids from Tennessee are not prevented, I cannot keep up railroad communication.

Lieutenant-General PEMBERTON:

If Grant's army lands on this side of the river, the safety of Mississippi depends on beating it. For that object you should unite your whole force.

The enemy have crossed in large force from Hard Times to Bruinsburg, below Bayou Pierre, and have pressed Bowen very hard all day. Cannot you do something to operate against them on your side of the river?
