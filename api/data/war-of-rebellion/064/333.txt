MORGANZA, June 13, 1864-10 a. m.

Major-General CANBY:

I have just received an order, dated June 6, from Department of the Gulf, to resume the movement to New Orleans of the Thirteenth Corps. Your verbal instructions to me were to suspend the movement until you were heard from. As you are in New Orleans, and I presumed the order to be issued with the full understanding of your verbal order to me, I shall proceed at once to execute the order and commence the movement by starting the wagons and McGinnis' command.

Brigadier General W. H. EMORY,

Commanding Nineteenth Army Corps, Morganza, La.:

GENERAL: The Nineteenth Army Corps will be re-enforced by a division from the Thirteenth Army Corps. The regiments that are to remain will be designated to-day; the others will be sent down. The four regular batteries will be relieved and sent north. Captain Closson will be retained for the present. The artillery with the corps will be two six-gun batteries with each division, one four-gun battery with the Cavalry Division. All these batteries will be selected and completely equipped.

Major-General CANBY,

New Orleans, La.:

I cannot make out two six-gun batteries for each of the divisions to be left without drawing largely on the batteries of the Nineteenth Corps in and about New Orleans. I have a report on the subject from Chief of Artillery Closson. Shall I send it to you in New Orleans or hold it until you come up here? Two of the batteries of Lawler's division I do not consider fit for the field, and they are in such condition that they cannot be arranged here to be made fit.
