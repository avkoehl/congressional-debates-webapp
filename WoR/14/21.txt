
some S miles above us, and on the other side of Bull Run; that is, west of Centreville.

I have some information as to the position of General Jackson. He is northwest of Manassas Gap 25 miles, and southwest of Winchester, at a place called New Market, in what is called the "Valley of the Blue Ridge;" has 35,000 men and three batteries. The infantry at Warrenton Junction is 5,000 men and one regiment of Stuart's cavalry in advance 3 miles. At the Rappahannock Bridge they have some 50,000 men. They are falling back since Friday last toward Fredericksburg. The bridge is not yet broken down but is mined, and they appear to be throwing up a small bridge-head in rear on the heights. We have all this information from different intelligent persons, both white and black.

Yours, truly,

I. B. RICHARDSON,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Division.

SIR: I have just received this report, and respectfully forward it to the Headquarters of the Army of the Potomac. I think that the informers have overstated the numbers of the enemy.

Very respectfully,

E. V. SUMNER,

Brigadier-General, U. S. Army, Commanding.

FORT MONROE, March 19, 1862.

(Received 7.40 p. m.)

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Matters all right here and will work well. The forces can be landed rapidly, but none have arrived up to 1 o'clock p. m. If the general commanding decides to send all to this point that fact should be communicated in order to provide locations for them. Will you please ascertain and advise me?

THOMAS A. SCOTT,

Assistant Secretary of War.

THOMAS A. SCOTT,

Assistant Secretary, Fort Monroe:

Arrangements should be made for the accommodation of a large force at Fortress Monroe, so as to be ready if General McClellan should make that his point. I have requested him to give you instructions.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.
