Appointing a Committee, fyc.—Mr. McKeon.
H. of Reps.
"The President deems this to be a proper occa-
sion to remind the Government of her Britannic
Majesty that ihe case of the Caroline has been long
since brought to the attention of her Majesty's prin-
cipal Secretary of Siafe for Foreign Affairs, who,
up to this day, has not communicaied its decision
thereupon It is hoped that the Go/ernment of
her Majesty will perceive the importance of no
longer leaving the Government of ihe United States
uninformed of ltb views and intentions npon a sub-
ject which has n&tually produced much exas-
perations, and which has led to such grave conse-
quences "
I have now to inform you that Mr Fox has. ad-
dressed a note to this Department, under date of
the 12th instant, in which, under the immediate in-
struction and direction of his Government, he de-
mands, formally and officially, McLeod's immedi-
ate release, on th" ground ihat ihe t ansact on, on
account of which he h?s been arrested and is to be
put upon his trial, was of a public character,
planned and executed by the persons duly empow-
ered by her Majesty's colonial authorities to take
any steps, and to do any acts, which might be ne-
cessary for the defence of her Majesty's territories,
and for the protection of her Majesty'  • ubjects,
and that oonsequently those ubjects of her Majesty
who engaged in that transaction were performing
an act of public duty, for which they cannot be
made personally and individually answerable to the
laws and tribunals of any foreign country, and
that her Majesty's. Government has further direct-
ed Mr Fox to make known to the Government of
the Umt d States that her Majesty's Government
entirely approves of the cjuise pursued by Mr
Fox, and the langu ge «derated by turn n the cor-
respondence above mentioned
There is, therefore, now, an authentic de ira-
tion on the British Government tn?t the attack on
Ihe Caroline was an act rf Dubuc ftrce, diet/
military men, under the orders of tneir superiors,
and is recognised as such by the Queen's Govern-
ment The lmpoi lance of th ¡> declaration is not
to be doubted, and tee President is of opinion that
it calls upon him ñr the peiforrmnce of a high
duty. Inatan mdividial forming part cf a puo-
lic force, and acting under the authority of his
Government, is not to be held answerable, as a pri-
vate trespasser or ma'etactor, is a piincipie of pub-
lic law, sanctioned by the u'ages of all civ hz d
nation', and which the Government of the United
Slates has no inclination to dispute This has no
connection whatever with the question whetner, m
this case, the attack on the Caroline wa , as the
British Government think it, a justifiable emp'oy
ment of force for tne purpose of defending the
British territory from unprovoked attack, cr whe-
ther it was a most unjustifiable invasion in time of
peace of the eruto y of tie Un ted States, as this
Government has legarded t The two q lesions
are e^sentialh different, an , wane ack o«l dging
that an individual may claim immunity from the
conseqaences of acts done by hur, by showing that
he acted under national author ty, this Government
is not to be understood as cnanging the opinions
which  has heretofore exp essed in regard to the
leal nature of the trantae ion which res.jltea m ihe
destruction of the Caroline Tnat sjbjcCt it is-not
necessary, for any purpose connected with thw
communication, to discus The views of tin-.
Government in relat on to it are known to that of
England, and we are expecting the answer ot that
Governi, ent to the commun cVion uhich has been
made to it
All this is intended to b  "siJ, at prr t t is, thit,
Hnca the attafk on the Carohn is-n owed asa na
tional act wn ch may jus lfy apa a'' or even ge-
neral war, if the Government oi tie Un s* Sti es
in the judgment which it shah form of the trat s ic-
t on, and oi i s o-vn djty, siou i sc« 'it o to de-
cide, yet ihat it rais"s a ques on entirely pub ic ?nJ
politoal, a qu sf between in'ep^ndent tiini
and that m < v duals concrne 1 in it cann it be «i-
rested and tried Wore the orhnary tribunal , as
for the violatim cf municipal iaw If ihe attack
on the Caiolin  was unjusufiab e, as this Govern-
ment has asserted, the iaw which has been violated
is the law of nations, and the redress which is to be
sougnt is the redress authorized in such cases by
the provisions of that code
You are well aware that the President has no
power to arrest the proceedms in the civil and cri
mmal courts of the State of New York. If this in-
dictment were pending m ore of the courts of the
Uni'ed St?tes, I am directtd to say that the Presi-
dent, upon the rece p* of Mr Fox's last communi-
cation, would have immediately directed a nolle
prottqm to be entered
Whether, in this case, the Governor of New
York have that power, or, if he have, whether he
would feel it his duty to exercise it, are points upon
which we are not informed
It ísunders ood that Mr. Mcleod is holden also on
civil process, sued out against him bv the owner of
the Caroline We suppose it very clear that the
Executive of the S ate ennot interfere with such
a piocess, and, indeed, if such process were pend-
ing m the courts of the United S ates, the Presi-
dent could not arrest it. In such, and many ana-
logous cases, the party prosecuted or sued must
avail himself of his exemption or deience by judi-
cial proceeding , either m the court into which he
is called, or in some otuer court But whether the
process be criminal or civil, the fact of having acted
under public authority, and in obedience lo the
orders of lawful superiors, must be regarded as a
valid defence, otherwise ind viduals would be
holden responsible for lrjuries resulting from the
acts of Government, and even fro<n the operations
of public war
You will oe furni hed witu a copy o this ins ruc-
tion for the use of the ExecutH e of New Yo k
and the Attorney Gereral of that State You will
carry with you, also, authentic evidence of the re-
cognition by the British Government of the de
s ruction of the Caroline as an act of publu, force
done by naüoi il aathou y
The Pres dent ju> impressed with tut propriety of
t ansferring the trial from the ccei e of the princi-
pal excitement to some other and distant county
You will take care that this be suggested to the
prisoner's counsel The President is gratified re
l°arn that the Go/irno' of New Yore has already
directed that the trial'ike place before the Ch ef
Justice of the State
Having consul ed with the Governor, >ou will
proceed to Lockpoit, or wherever else the trial
may be holden, and lurnish the prisoner's counsel
wi h the evidence of wh ch you will b* in possec-
s on material to his defence You will see that he
have siilful and eminent counsel, if such be not
already retained, a-d, al'nough you a'e not de
sired to act as counsel yoa's lf, ' ou will came it to
be signified to him, and to the gentleman «ho may
conduct his defence, that it is the wish of his Go
vera ment that, in ease bi> d-fer.ce be overruled by
the court in which he shall be med, proper steps
be taken immediately fot removing ihe cause, by
wn of enor, to the Supreme Court of the Uni ed
Sa'es
The President hopes you wnl use suci < espatch
as to m ke vour arrival ?t the place of tr al su<-e
before the tiial comes on, and he tins'syou will
keep him informed r f wi atever tccars by means
of a c nespond°ce through thi  D partm^m
I have the honor to be, Mr Attorney General,

REMARKS OF MR. McKEON,
OF NEW  \OKK
in the Howe  of Represeuatwes May 31, 1841—On
Mr Wise's motion to appo nt a corra i e to
wa t upon the Pre  dent,  «nd inform  htm  tlw
the II t,se ot Kep f se it  ivrs was  now j'jn
iz d, ard readv to pro-eeo. to basins
Mr  McKEON moved   in strike  tut   the vord
Pre idei t, a' d ns rt   'Vife Pre i lent, n iw  cxl
c sirg the ifhce or P es 'cut of he United Stat s  '
Mr McK sail    at  be knew net  wncUitr the
House was at this time disced to emeium a y
discussion on the subject wh ch he had introduced
He assured honorable gentlemen that he  /as as
urul as they were of this day s protracted proceed-
ings, but he was not willing to permit a question as
important as it was novel, to be passed over in si-
lence. To some it might appear trifling, but to his
mind this was one of those cases where names very
frequently become matters of substance. Fatigued
as the members of this House were with the labors
of the day, he regretted that he was under the ne-
cessity of calling their attention to the matter, but,
if the present oppor unity was passed by, he knew
of no proceeding upon which he could with so
much propriety offer his amendment as that made
now by his. friend from Virginia It was the first
time in the history of the Government that the
question had arisen whether the Vice President of
the United S'ates becomes the President on
the deatn of the President It was not in
ary po'itical view that he submitted this
question to the House. Standing as he did in a
minority, as already evinced by the vote of this
day, it could afford him no advantage He sub-
mit'ed h with a sincere desire ef settling a point
which had created great difference of opinion
tnroughout the country, and thereby making a pre-
cedent for the government of the future Legisla-
tures of this Union
He was one of those who believed that the pre-
sent bead of the Government is not President of
the United States. He disclaimed the desire to
create any invidious distinctions No man had a
higher personal regard for the distinguished indivi-
dual to whom he alluded, than he (Mr. McK ) had
But he believed h« was bat Vice President exercu-
mg the office of President of the United States. A
calm appeal to ihe Constitution and the history of
its formation must lead to that conclusion. The
C institution plainly shows on its face that there is
but one way in which any man can btcome en-
titlt d to the designation of President, and that is by
el'dion di ectly That instrument provides, in cer-
am cases, for the performaace of his duties by
otner officer , with diffeient designations, but in no
one case declares any efheer shall, m such case, be
designated as President The House would ob-
serve that he, vMr McK ) in his amendment, had
not even called him "acting President," because
tnere is no such tale in the Constitution, he had
taken the form of his amendment from artice 1,
seen n 3, subdivis on 5, of the Constitution, which
provides thit "the Senate shall choose their own
office! s, and al o a President pro tempore, in the ab-
sence of the Vice President, or when he shall exer-
cise the office ot President ot the United States "
He iou"d in the Constitution a form of expres-
sion which exac ly me1 the case now before us, and
he preferred to use it rather than to invent an-
ot-ier
Tnere was another section which was generally
referred to on all discussions ou this subject. He
would call the attention of the House ta ar-
ticle II, section I, sub divwon 6, which says,' in
c?se ot the íe íoval of the President from office, or
0' his deatn, res gnanon, or inability to discharge
the powers and duties i f the said office, the same
shall devolve on the Vice Piesident, and the Con-
gress may, by la.v,piovide for tne case of removal,
death, resignation, or inability, both of the Presi-
dent nd Vice P.es t,ent, declaring wha officershall
th n act as P esident, and such officer shall act ac-
cordingly, until the dsabihty be removed, ora
President   hallbeeecel"
U ider this sect! in i* was contended that on the
dea'h ot a Presiden the office, and not the powers
and duties ot f re ldent, belong to the V ce President
ft wa evident to h m hat if this was the true con-
struct ( ■>, t íe cilice of Vic President was rendered
vacan bt. th  elevation oi that officer to the Presi-
lencj__ii could not have been  the intention of
me iraiier* rf ih* Con tituiion as tney had ex-
p' s ¡y pic de i tuat the Presidem pre tempore of
t ie 'sVia e nail preside over tha' body when the
Vice Presi lent sha 1 exercis the cfece ot Presi-
dent They evidenly did not intend that the Pre-
sent's d vh or inability to act, snju d vacate the
Vice President's office, in h s (Mr McK' )
understanding of the Constitution, when the
President died there nas a vacancy in the
office of Piesident, an i in no other office.
That wa- the only difficulty which occurred
in the whole series of officers conducting the affairs
