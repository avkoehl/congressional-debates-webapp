were removed, and a number still remain within
the district temporarily assigned to them, on the
pull" side of the peninsula. These continue, as ;
heretofore, in charge of the military, and this De-
partment has no control or jurisdiction over them.
Notwithstanding the efforts that have been made,
and the heavy expense incurred, during the last
six years, to effect the removal of the Choctaws
remaining in Mississippi, a considerable number
still continue indisposed to migrate to the country
provided for the tribe west of the State of Arkan-
sas. Anxiety is felt that the State of Mississippi
shall be speedily relieved of this incumbrance, and
the Indians transferred to more comfortable homes
among their brethren, where they would be com-
paratively prosperous and happy. In view of
past results, it is evident that more efficient meas-
ures are necessary to accomplish their removal.
These, it is hoped, may be devised and put into
successful operation at an early day.
Conceding the general wisdom and justice of the
policy, adopted in 1847, of paying the annuities
to the Indians on the per capita principle, in my
judgment there are material objections to the
manner.in which it has been practically applied.
The regulation on this subject provides that a por-
tion of the annuities may be set apart by the
Indians for national and charitable purposes.
These purposes, however, have never been par-
ticularly defined; rules are not prescribed for de-
termining the amounts to be provided for them,
nor have measures been taken to encourage the
Indians to make so wise and beneficial a disposi-
tion of their funds. They naturally desire to re-
ceive individually the full amount of their respect-
ive shares, and consequently their entire annuities
have been distributed equally among them. How-
ever fair and equitable Uiis mode of payment may
appear, it is not altogether just to the chiefs, nor
consistent with sound policy. It is through the
medium of the chiefs that the Government holds
intercourse and dealings with the tribes in the
transaction of their more important business; and
it is not unreasonable that they should expect
more from the Government than the common In-
dians receive, in consideration of their station and
the services they perform. But according to the
present mode of paying their annuities, the In-
dians are all and alike placed on a common level;
and, as no discrimination is made in favor of the
chiefs, their influence is not only diminished, but
a feeling of contempt for governmental authority
in general is extensively inspired. Evils of no or-
dinary magnitude are thus produced, which, it is
believed, may be remedied by a .proper exercise
of the discretionary power over this subject vested
in the President and the Secretary of the Interior.
The greatest difficulty which the Government
and individuals have to contend with, in their ef-
forts to ameliorate the condition of our Indians, is
their strong and uncontrollable appetite for ardent
spirits, and the facility with which they can still
be procured, notwithstanding the stringency of
our laws, and the strenuous efforts oftheagentsand
military to prevent its introduction among them.
It is a deplorable fact that there are many per-
sons engaged in the villainous business of smug-
gling liquor into the Indian country; while others,
less daring, but equally depraved, are stationed
near their borders for the purpose of carrying on
an unholly traffic with them. The States within
which these miscreants take refuge should be in-
voked to put an effectual stop to their abomina-
tions.
The work of collecting and digesting statistical
and other information, illustrative of die history,
condition, and future prospects of* the Indian
tribes, has been unremittingly prosecuted, and the
results, it is believed, will not only be of much ■
general interest, but highly useful to the Depart-
ment in the administration of our Indian aflmrs.
The first part of these investigations is in press,
and will be laid before Congress at an early period
of the ensuing session. j
_ A striking disparity exists between the finan- I
cial estimates of this office submitted to Congress
at the commencement of the last session and those !
prepared for submission at the commencement of
the next. The latter exceeds the former by a
very large amount; and, to prevent misconcep-
tion, a brief explanation may be necessary. i
Estimates are divided into two classes, techni- 1
cally called regular and special. The first class
relates exclusively to objects of fixed and perma-
nent character, and to appropriations therefor, to
be expended within the ensuing fiscal year; the
latter to temporary and miscellaneous objects,
and to appropriations therefor, to be expended
within the current as well as the fiscal year.
Heretofore the practice has been to submit the
regular estimates alone at the opening of Congress,
and the special estimates from time to time during
the progress of the session. But, in preparing
the estimates for the present year, care has been
taken, pursuant to your instructions, to make
them so full and comprehensive as to embrace
both classes in one general estimate; thereby, as :
far as practicable, placing before Congress at a
single view, and at the commencement of the ,
session, every object, of whatever character, for i
which an appropriation may be required. Hence |
the estimates of the present year, thus aggre- j
gated and combined, exceed the regular esti- i
mates of the last.$1,423,033 49; and yet they fall ;
short of the actual appropriations at the recent i
session, on Indian account, some $18,000, while
the regular estimates of last year exceed the cor-
responding class in the present general estimate
$4,390—the difference being occasioned by the
omission of sundry items and the reduction of
others.
Great care has also been taken to make the ex-
planatory remarks accompanying the estimates
conformable to law. They succinctly but clearly
exhibit the grounds on which the several items are
respectively founded; and although the aggregate
is large, it cannot, in my judgment,be materially
diminished without detriment to the public in-
terest.
The present force of this office is less than in
former years, and inadequate to the prompt dis-
cbarge of its greatly augmented ana increasing
duties. An additional number of clerks, and a
thorough reorganization of the Department, are
i indispensably necessary. But as a full and satis-
; factory exposition of the measures required in
i this connection would involve elaborate detail, they
< will form the subject of a special communication.

Report of the Commissioner of tlie General
Land Office.
General Land Office, Nov. 30,1850.
Sir: In submitting for your consideration a re-
port of the operations of this branch of the service
during the past year, I have concluded to modify
to some extent the forms of statistics, by present-
ing semi-annual tables of the sale and disposal of
the public lands so as to conform to the fiscal year,
and at the same time admit of being arranged by
calendar years when desired. As it has been the
practice to found the table for the third quarter, in
part, upon estimates, I have concluded this year to
dispense with it, and to carry the statistics into the
body of the report.
The surveys of the public lands and private
claims have been prosecuted during the past year
with all the energy which the means at the dis-
posal of this office would permit. The late period
at which the appropriations for the current year
were made prevented the extension of the surveys
this Fall in the Northwest, as intended, so as to
keep pace with the progress of settlement. The
delay thus caused, however, will be compensated
by increased efforts in the ensuing Spring, so that
the numerous settlers in that direction may have
an early opportunity of purchasing their improve-
ments.
In the States of Ohio, Indiana, Mississippi, and
Alabama the surveys have been completed, the ar-
chives connected therewith transferred to the State
authorities, as required by the act of June 12,1840,
and the office of surveyor general in those States
discontinued. In Illinois^ Arkansas, Michigan,
Missouri, Louisiana, ana Florida, the surveys
are being brought to a close as speedily as practi-
cable, as will be perceived by reference to the fol-
lowing table, showing the area of each State, the
number of apres surveyed, and the number re-
maining unsurveyed:
♦Exclusive of Chickasaw lands.
Thus it is shown that, in a few years, the sur-
veys of the public lands in all these States wiH be
completed, and the archives connected therewith
transferred to the respective States as provided by
law. The object in-pressing forward the surveys
has been to keep pace with settlement, and to en-
able enterprising pioneers to avail themselves of
j the benefits of the preemption act of 1841, which
i in express terms excludes all persons who settle
^ on unsurveyed lands.
Where the surveys have been careftilly and cor-
rectly executed, it is but seldom that a resurvey is
necessary, and hence no further expenditure in
this branch of the service is required.
Much embarrassment has been experienced in
i determining the location and survey of private
j claims, especially in Florida and Louisiana; but,
under the judicious direction of the surveyors gen-
! eral of those States, the difficulty to a great extent
! has been removed. In Florida most of the private
claims have been located and surveyed, and the
I work appears to have been done in a manner gen-
j erally acceptable. During the present season it is
expected that the remainder of the private claims,
J and most, if not all, of the public lands of any
; value outside the Seminole reservation, in this
i State, will be surveyed.
1 In Louisiana the resurveys in the Greensburg
i district, authorized by the act of 29th August, 1842,
have been prosecuted with great diligence under
i the judicious and skillful direction of the surveyor
' genera], and many of the erroneous and fraudulent
surveys in that district, which had materially re-
tarded public business for years, and proved a
1 source of embarrassment and annoyance, have
| been corrected.
i Every effort has been made by the surveyors
general, and this office, to prevent errors and
frauds in the public surveys; and for this purpose
stringent regulations have been adopted, and ex-
plicit instructions issued.
Notwithstanding these precautions, it has re-
cently been discovered that in some of ^he surveys
executed many years ago, especially in the north'
! era part of the southern peninsula of Michigan,
| errors and frauds were committed, and a few of
; like character are of more recent occurrence.
These evils cannot be wholly remedied by ex-
i isting legislation or instructions. They are caused
! by the want of skill or integrity on the part of the
