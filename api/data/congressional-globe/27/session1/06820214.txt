¿7th Cong......1st Sess.                                   Bankrupt Bill—Mr. Mcholson.             __________________________Senate.
I say, continued Mr B. that this charter is eve'y
way more valuable to the corporators thin that of
1832, as renewed and arrested by the Presidential
veto; and I prove it. in the first place, this char-
ter is for twenty years; that was for fifteen. The
capital of that Bank was limited to thirty-five mil
lions, this may be extended to fifty millions The
United S'ates are to furnish the one third of the
capital to this new Bank; they furnished but th«
one-fifth to that of 1832 By this charter, this
Bank is to be "the Treasury of the United States,'1'1
a new and alarming provision, never before
inserted in any bank charter upon earth By this
charter, all the public moneys are required to be
placed in the Bank, and all payment., are to be
made in checks upon it. This is a new and por
tentous privilege, and insures the Bank the great
advantage of making all Governm-nt piyments in
its o n paper In the next place, this Bank is to
have the privilege of receiving all foreign gold
coins at a less value than their current legal value
— ita les> rate than that fixed by the act of 1834—
a privilege never before granted to any bank in
any portion of the world. Again: this Bank is to
have the privilege of dealing in coin—of buying and
selling gold and silver com—the privilege ot mak
ing merchandise of the standard of value; an ab
surd and barbarian privilege, never before dreamed
of even by a horn-book politician, but which wil
be of incredible value to the Bank The late Bank
of the United States found it so profitable to deal m
com, that it violated its charter for this purpose,
and plundered the South and West of many tens
of millions of specie to sell in Europe This new
Bank is to have this privilege, to be «ecured to it
by charter The stockholders also have the unpre-
cedented privilege of beginning busme&s a? soon as
they pay in ten per centum on the stock, an inesti-
mable privilege which will enable them to pay
in the remaining ninety per cent, ot loans of
public money in the Bank made to them-
selves, and, in fact, to bank wholly on
public money Finally, the great privileges of
holding the public moneys in deposite, and pay-
ing the publicdaes with its notes, and other valua-
ble privilege"!, are a 1 secured to it until Congress
«¡haljl Mbv law," direct the contrary No other
banWver had such a privilege. The Executive
could remove the deposites, and '■top the receipt!
of the notes, and ought to have that forever Pre-
sident Jackson saved the country by it in 1833
Now, it will require a law to remove deposites, or
stop the receivability of notes, so that, if the Bank
can contrive to keep up a majority ot friends in
either House of Congres-s, it is safe power ' No
matter what its crimes, or its condition may be.
so kngasitcan manage to keep or g m a majo-
rity of friends in either He use of Congres*, it is
safe, and may go on plundering and cheating the
count) y, and governing elections., and bribing as it
pleases Thii great privilege, so detrimental to
the country, so suicidal to the Government, so in
v ting to the Bank to interfere in our elections and
iu Congress, is granted to this Bank for the first
time that it ever was granted to any bank, and
like all the rest, is granted for nothing' a mere
gratuity—a naked present to corporators'
These are a part of the advantages the addi-
tional advantages over and above those granted m
the renewed charter of 1832, whieh this Bank re-
ceives, and for which it pays nothing • Why, the
late Bank of the United States, after tha veto, gave
to Pennsylvania five milhors of dollars as a bonus
for a mere State charter Estimated by that test,
and what would this charter comirand? At least
ten millions' and yet it is to go for noth ng! And
even this reduction of m'erest—this small indem-
nity for the lost bonus—is resisted, and may be de-
feated.
Sir, this Administration came into power upon a
promise of reform, of retrenchment, of econom/,
of no proscription for opinion's sake, and notmng
but patriotism for their guide How have these
promises been fulfilled' How have they been
kept? Violated' violated' violated' Never have
such violations of professions be< n seen or
heard of Every act of the nf v powers is
a violation of a promise, a* d row here
romes a squandering of from five to   m millions
of dollars at one single throw ' a broad cast throw
of so many millions' This charter, with its extra-
ordinary and unprecedented privilege', would sell
for many millions of dollars; yet it is to go for
nothing' Whatr would be said oí a proposition to
give five millions of dollars out of the Treasury,
or five millions of acres of the public lands, to two
or three hundred farmer ? Such a proposal would
justly be deemed wanton reckless, wasteful, profli-
gate and scandalous Yet the gratuitous gift of
this charter is far worse It is a gift of more than
five millions in money, not to farmers, but to mil-
ltonary speculators, to whom, besides, power is
given over the politics, the property, the commerce,
the currency, the growing crops, and the whole bu-
siness of the country.
Sir, I say there never was a charter granted so
injurious to the public and the Government—so
beneficial to the corporators, as this proposed fis-
cahty: and is the Government, and the public,
contrary to all usage, and to all justice, to receive
nothing for it? nothing in the shape of bonus,, or
reduced interest? I am no fuend to the bonus
system, it is a mode of raising money which I
do disapprove. Like the great Jackson, I am
against selling privileges and monopolies to corpo-
rators, but, like him also, I am still more against
giving tbe« pnviliges and monopolies to them for
nothing' I demand something for this charter—
this charter worth so many millions' Will the ma-
jority say it shall go for NOTHING? If they do,
they place the club of Hercules in the hands of the
REPEALERS'

ton, and it was rejected by a vote of 17 to 26, as

SPEECH OF MR NICHOLSON,
OF TENNESSEE
In Senate, July 23, 1841—On ihe proposnton to in-
clude banking corporations within the provisions
oí the bankrupt bill.
Mr NICHOLSON said Mr. President, it will
be remembered by the Senate that, upon proposing
the amendment now under consideration, I avowed
my object to be, to present the wmple question,
whether banks -hould or should not be included in
the provisions of the bill. I announced also that
if it should be ascertained that a majority of the
Senate were in favor of the abstract proposition
presented, it would then become necessary to
adopt other amendments te> carry out this new
feature of the bill Those other amendments I
stated to the Senate I was prepared to present, but
that I deemed it unnecessary to do so until it was
ascertained what may be the «entiments of a ma-
jority of the Senate on the abstract question. The
Senator from Georgia [Mr Berhihj] objects to
my proposition because it presents the naked ab-
stract question without the details I should be
entirely willing, Mr President, to withdraw the
amendment as it now stands and to present one
which would set forth all the details But it would
be useless to consume time in discussing the de-
tails tf the propositan, it, after all, it should be
found that the general principle of including
ba'iks ivas, not sanctioned by a majority of the
Senate
In order, however, Mr President, to lemove all
objections as to the difficulties suggest? d by the Se-
na'or trom Georgia, [Mr Bebrien] I will read to
the Senate the amendment which I have prepared,
containing all the necessary details in an indepen-
dent section Itwill be observed that I have adopted
substantially the provisions of the amendment of-
fered by the Senator from New York [Mr.WsieHT]
to the bill to incorporate the Fi«cal Bank of the
United States. The provisions are virtually the
1
same with those now in force in the State of New
York The whole section, as I shall propose it, is
as follows, viz:
Sec Whenever any banking corporation (except such as are
owned wholly or in part by a State) chartered for the purpose
of issuing notes, bills, or evidences of debt, to be circulated as
money, shall fait or refuse for thirty days to redeem us said ha
bilities m specie, such suspension ef specie payments shall be
deemed and adjudged cause for declaring such banking corpo
poration to be bankrupt, and if at any tune alter July 1, 1842,
such suspension shall take place it shall be Ihe duty of the
district attorney of the United States for the district m which
snch corporation shall be situated, to make application to the
circuit court of the United States, if in session, or to the district
or circuit judge if not in session, by bill or petition in the na
ture ofa proceeding in chancery, for an injunction to restrain
the said bank and ail the branches, offices, an i agencies thereof,
wherever located from making any further issues of bills,
notes drafts or other secunties for ihe payment of, and calcu
lated and intended to circulate as money and from ail transfers
of property sates, purchases or any other tianactions of bust
ne^s which may endangeroi impair the security of the credi
tors of the said bank of any class or description, and for the ap
pomtment by the said court, or the said |udge as the case may
be ofa trustee or trustees to take the supervision care, and
charge of the property, effects and rights, books, papers,
and all other things belonging to the said bank and the branches
offices, and agencies thereof and all money goods, and secun ,
ties deposited therein, to whomsoever the same may of light
belong And the said court shall, upon the filing of such bill
oi petition, have full and ample equity jurisdiction of
the whole matters, and shall m case the said corporation,
with the aid of the trustee or trustees so appointed by the
said court, or the said chief justice as the case may be, fail
to resume specie payments in full at the said puncipal bank,
and all the blanches offices and agencies thereof, withm
the space of thirty days lrom the day of such suspension,
and to continue such specie payments without farther inter
ruptionor suspension thenthe saidcouitshall proceed to or
der the transfer both of possession and pioperty, of all the
proper y and effects of the said corporation of every name and
character whatsoever to the trustee or trustees aforesaid, to be
perfected, and to have all the business of the said corporation
finally closed under its order and direction and the charter for
felted and annulted And before any dividend shall be made
from the said property as the avails thereof to the creditors of
the said corporation, all the expenses incuired under the direc
tion of the said court in pursuance of the provisions of this sec
tion of this act, as allowed and taxed by the said court, oi the
judge thereof, shall be first paid, and when the dividends are
made, the creditors of the said corporation shall be preferred
in the following order, viz
The holders of the bills, notes and other paper of the said
corpoiation, issued and intended to circulate as money, and
actually so circulated and used shall be first fully paid accord
ing to the provisions of this section
The pi lvate depositories of the said Bank shall next be fully
paid, according to the same rule
All the othei creditors ol the said corpoiation, the stockhold
ers excepted shall next be fully paid according to the tenor
and effect ot then respective contracts with, and obligations
agau st the said coi puratiou
All the stockholder of the said corpoiation shall be next
paid the nominal value of the stock held by them íespectively,
in case the fund remaining m charge of the said court, over and
above expenses, shall be equal to such payment
Now, Mr. President, it will be observed that by
this amendment I propose to make a continued
suspension of specie payments for thirty days the
cause for which a bank may be declared bankrupt.
Bank^ are incorporated for public, and not for
private purposes One condition is universally
annexed to their charters—that they shall at all
times furnish a circulation equal to gold and silver
—a circulation which the public can at any mo-
ment convert into specie. This condition is uni-
versal in bank charters, and it should be inviola-
ble I propose to annex to its violation the penal-
ty of death to the charter. Surely when a corpo-
ration has violated for thirty days this fundamen-
tal condition of its creation, the public, for whose
benefit it was enacted, have a right to demand the
termination ot its existence.
The next prominent feature in my amendment
ii, that it makes it the duty of an officer of this Go-
vernment to institute the necessary proceedings
wheneter a bank shall suspend specie payments
I regard this as an important and indispensable
provision It is essential to cut off all hope of le-
gislative sanction of suspensions to coerce the ma-
nagers of banks to feel and see constantly the full
danger of suspensions. Our experience proves to
us that bank suspensions are too ofien sanctioned
and acquiesced in by the State Legislatures. If
this ground of hope is cut off, and < uspendmg banks
are at once turned over to the Federal judiciary,
whose course is not subject to legislative interfer-
ence, we shall throw around the banks the most
effectual check
The remainder of my amendment, Mr. Presi-
dent, consisto of the details as to ihe mode of pro-
ceeding when a bank has suspended, and has been
brought into the court for judgment. It is unne-
cessary for me to say any thmg now on that part
of the amendment,
