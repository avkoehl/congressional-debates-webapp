catedby tin. President of the "united States which stated not
Oidy that a General was sent, but tint msuuctions were given
to the Attorney Geneial, and the in ructions themselves were
communicated to Cmere=s, w.tn the President's nessage, at
the very enmm ncefnent of the session
Why, then, shot, d this House be occupied hour after hour m
discussing whether the Attorney Geneial was sent to New
York, and what he was about there when the Piesident h m
sell hag told you that he wa« sent and the object of his mission
Every body knew it before the question was asked    What
then'1 Has not the President a right to «end the Attorney Gene
ral to New York on that or any other subject?   Where is the
constitutional provision prohibiting hitn from sending the At
toiney General to ísew York on that or any other of the subjects
which are before thejuhcial courtsof that State?   Ye«, the At
torney Genera! has been sen there and v e have his instruc
tions    And I have heard here, on the pan of some «f my forty
friends fro 11 New 1 oik agreat deal about the conscious dig
nity and honor of this Empire State of New Yoik    ISow lam
not very fond of that term   Empire State J m the la guagreof
this Union and I «ay that if there is pn   Emi ire ' btate in tins
Union, it is Delaware    To be magniloquent and talk about the
fmpire State, may well become thf fortv g n'lemen whore
present the State on this floor, having leference to their own
numbers and the numbers of meir co st tutnis or tu the extent,
fertility and beauty of her soil   yet thi- is a distinction not re
cosm ed in the Cor^titution of the Lmtel State     They are all,
as members of the Union equal   and the a ate o! Delaware has
as stood a right to be railed the (Emp re State ' as iNew Y01 k
Now, if my forty friends ftom New York choose to call H the
Empire State, I will not quarrel with then     It is only as to
co sequences that I enter my cavear against the two fiequent
use of those terms on this floor   for there is mpinipg in those
words ' Empire Stat-*' when 13sed among co estates more than
mectstheear    Suppose it was in Delaware that cuchan event
ha i occuned, do yon suppose my friend here [Mr Rod^et:]
iiom Delaware would hav   offeied such a resolution as this1
And by the tenm of the resolution I should presume that my
friends from New \ ork think there, is a little more dignity and
power in having forty Representatives than only one
But there is anotner point of view in which I ask the attention
of the House to thi& evolution At the\ery tirnewhen wehave
this great issue upon another point with the British nation and
when this lesokuinn and every thinsr connected with it is blow
wff the coals to make another is^ue there is behind it another
effort to make yet another is=ue between this Government and
the State of New York What ib the object of thafi Are you
going to wir with a foreign i ation* An lis that a time to «plit
hair^n q ipstionsof juiisdicti  n b°tween the Government of
the United State" «id that of ore of the pepii ite Wates? And
are you going to bring up the question ' Which of the two has
the ri^ht the precious light, to hang Mcleod'1' Arp you 201112
to make an issue between the State of New Yoik and the Go
vernmeat of the United Statos upon such an e\eicise of p^wer
a^ that? Are you going to show youi weakness at the very mo
ment when you are bearding the lion m his den"1 Is that the
time to make an issue between the Government, which repre
sents the whole country, and a State a= to its power? God for
bid that I should question its powei but I inquire i& it politic
or wise to make a quarrel between that Government and this,
about the most insignificant ">f all que" ions as to which of you
shall release McLeod7 Tor, while some gtntfemen talk ibout
hanging McLeod others more merciful, tell us that if it should
turn out that this man wab concerned in the affair of the Caro
line yet that there was a power in the State of New "Vork that
mistht prevent his execution—that the Executive of New \ ork
had the power of pardoning as well as the General Govern
mpntj and that the attnbute of mercy wou! 1 be e-ieicised with
as much di^creti^n by the Gover 01 of Newloikas it\ ouH
be by the Pie-.ui>nl of the United ¡5tat <? But I see nothing in
the coirt^pocdeice wh 1 b las Ken lai 1 b foie u- that vvoutl
lead to the conclusion that tht, conr e of the law m New 1 01k
would not be cained out, accoidmeto all its right and a 1 its
disnities, and the man be leleased w hout the necessity of a re
sort to the authority of the Genei al Government

heve, indeed, no doubt that after the country "had bee« ravaged,
there would be vigor and bravery enough in itto raise ana ai-
1 ay an avenging host to invade m tul it tile enemy « cotintiy;, and
burn their property and destroy their wives and -children too,
and what satisfaction would that be to you1*
If gentlemen would look into the history of Scotland and
England, they would there find numerous accounts of the fright
fut and d sastrousborder wars that were cained on between the
fecotch and the English Gentlemen would there see what
might be the consequences here if this resolution were to be
carried into effect
It is but a few days since I heard a gent eman fiom New-
Hampshire [Mr  Eastman] say, with «ome  n,ain  and dis-
tress thitif the piesent Secretary of State remained m office
there would be no war—no war with England, and there was a
gieatdeal meant by that remark    And the gentleman seemed
to think this a lamentable condition of aflairs    I firmty be
lievfd it was true, but, I had a very different feebng from that
gentleman, and I «ay, God be praised if it he so, to preserve
peace between the two countries    And however long or short
the gentleman's career may be he will not see any im proper con
cession to Great Bntam sanctioned ly the piesent S cretaryof
State, whether m peace or wai    With respect to the present
que1; mn, I have no doubt thegendemai alluded to wou d "how
as much firmness as any mcmbei of this House    And one of
my rea=m is for troubling the House at this last expnmg mo
ment of the session is  that I might vindicate the conduct of
thatgeatleman and do him ijstice, for great injustice   has
been done hirn in regaid to his ,,emavksand cones^ondence
Now, I do not know that there is a word in his part of that
correspondence but what I would enOor^e    And I say if it is
concilia ory, if it has any tendency to soften the aspeuties and
rancoi that may exist between the two countries so much the
better, and I know it has had that effect    What did you hear
when you saw 1 report of a different character   Why, jour
minister at the Com t of St  James was panic struck, and sent
a mes^ige to yoursquadion m the Mediterranean to run awav
—to fly as fast a« the wind** could blow them—for Tuhn Euil
was at their heels'   [Laughter]   It isveiy much the fashion
to say, "lie did nothing moie than his duty "   The gentleman
from Pennsylvania fMr Ingbrsoli ] spoke of this transaction,
theoherdav* just vl would speak of it in general terms, but
he did not at all que&tion the propriety of the conduct of that
gentleman    I say, not so    I eay that he has disgraced this
nation more thin w e have ev<=>r been disfrace 1 since the affair
ot the Chesapeake frigate    W hat will the Germans, what will
the Italians what, in short, will all the great nations of Europe
say of the peopTe of the United States,?   That   upon   a  panic
teirorof their minister at London, they showed tne white fea
ther, and their line of battle ship tn the Meditei ranean waa
wai hei to seek refuge by flight from the tin ruu^ of Britain '
Anl there h another point of view in which I do iiotapprove
liisconduct The gentleman has been at Í ondon four or five
years I do not believe there was at I ondon a Charge from
any country in Ljrope but knew better what was done and do
mg m the Privy Council What is the business of a foreign
minister abroad but t j find outwhat is doing? I will ventuie
to say that if Christopher Hughes liad been at London, as our
Minister, he never would have written such a letter He
would have known that there was no order of Council to an
thorize hostilities and there cannot be hostilities without an
ordei ofthe Puvy Council Ispeak from experience when I
say that Mr Hughes would have been nformed of such or
ders in Council, had they been issued, and of course would not
have been frightened by every newspaper explosion of popu
lar wrath into a belief that the gia\e and reeponsible Council
of the nation had resorted to si ch an extremity at such a mo
There wib one memorablp cas  ofthe iddnss of Mr Hdghea
in procuring ommentüot the profoundestsecrecy Mr Strat
ford Canning came to me one day and «aidmat he hadrer
mission to read to me a paper of gieat importance emanating
flora 1 w Government in their negotiations with.the Euiopeon
