Major BEAUMONT,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Cavalry Corps:

MAJOR: My Second Brigade is now in camp at this place and the First Brigade is coming in. I got three pieces of artillery (field pieces) which had been abandoned between here and Columbus, and I have about 100 prisoners, including quite a number of officers. I shall feel much obliged if the general will allow me to push forward for Macon in the morning. I can capture the place before the material can be withdrawn or re-enforcements can be thrown in. I can start at daybreak in very good condition. Let me know if the general will allow me to push forward.

I am, respectfully, your obedient servant,

ROBT. H. G. MINTY,

Colonel.
