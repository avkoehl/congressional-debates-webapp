repiehensible conduct of its Envoy Enraordin ny
and Minister Plenipotentiary, in printing and dis-
tributing a pamphlet defamatory of this Govern-
ment and (he peodle of the United States, while in
the United States, under the protection of his di-
plomatic privilege The justiceoi the claim for the
cargo of the "Lou a," seized m 1821 by virtue
of the edicts of Iturbide, of 20th of February and
4th of March of that year, is acknowledged, and
a piomise is made to incite the Congress, upon and
befoiL whom the claim has been pressed for ten
years, to pruviele for the payment of the balance
due accoi 'nig to a decree of the Mexican Govern-
ment oí th  1st of February, 1822, heretofore par-
tially exec ited, but the justice of the case of the
" Cos->acl ," and of the claims of Chouteau and
De Munn, is den e 1, en the ground that the) oc-
cuired before Mexican independence was achiev-
ed V deen e ol rcstitutnn in the case of (lie
" C issicl " ins issued on the 27th of Tulv, 1891
It would seem,then, tlntihe decrees of the 20th Fe-
bruary and 4th of March, 1821 impose obligations
on the present Government of Mexico, but those of
the27hof July, 1821, do not Adecrecoflhe lstef
February, 1822, awarding indemnity, is good, a
similar deciee of the 27ih of July, 1821, is not
good The ¿Secretary of State does not perceive
upon whit pnnciples the e distinctions are made,
noi on what just ground payment can be refused
by Mexico for any Pots committed within its terri-
loial jiinshtioa after th' virtual sepa.ation of
■spat i an 1 Me t co i f aftei the occupation of
Spam b} Fiance in 1808 The case of Chouteau
and De Munn rens upon the grounds that the in-
juiy oicuiied whi'o Sp ui hael no power where it
wis reCLived, that Mexico had then, and has had
> ver smce, an effective contiol in Santa Fe, and
thai the present Government is answerable for the
acts of all IK defacto piecursors, who alleged and
exercise 1 sovereignty ovet the country With le 
htion to the brig " Cossack," the decree of restitu-
tion is daled after the plan of Iguala xvas declared,
less ¡han a mo ith before the treaty of Cordova
w is si >• led, by vhich O'Donoghue acknowledged
Ihc in h pendente of Mexro a id a short time pre-
v ions to Ihc election of a r gency, and the choice
rl Iimbile as Presidí nt of th  new Republic.
What paiticular meaning is affixed in Mexico to
the tei lis " melependence ach eved," i;> not under-
stood, nor is u important to discuss, as the obliga-
tion of Mexico dates from the time of declared or
actual independence of foreign control, and since
it maintained a dominion exclus ye of that of

The answei of the Mexican Mimstei to the de-
mand of tne United States, tounded upon the con-
duct of Mr &orosti/a, is so sins.uiar as to require

the siilijc-t of it Soon after the hte Mexican
Minister asl ed foi his passpoits to return home,
