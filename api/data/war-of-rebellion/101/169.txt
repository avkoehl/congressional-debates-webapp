and was on a raid for some point in this district. I could not tell where he would strike, but I determined to look for him and to close all his avenues of retreat. I sent a gun-boat and seventy-five Infantry to the head of Little Bayou Pigeon, which started last evening, and should arrive by noon to-day, which would cut off his retreat from the Pigeon, Grand River, and Cross Bayou. I sent 100 men in the small boats, which I have been preparing for such an event, from Bayou Boeuf through Grass Lake, Lake Verret, Bay Netchez, and Grand River, to look for him there, and to communicate with the gun-boat if Whitaker was not found. They started this morning. I sent 100 men from Donaldsonville, by the way of Grand Bayou, at the crossing between Doctor Ford's and Jauntes' place on Bay Natchez, with instructions to leave their horses at Grand Bayou under guard if they could not cross them, and go on foot to Bay Natchez, and if possible to learn of Whitaker, and to communicate with the small boat expedition. They started yesterday. I ordered the cavalry at Plaquemine (fifty-two strong) to The Park to cut off any retreat that way. They started at 10 o'clock this morning. Colonel Fiske telegraphs me that Whitaker reached McCall's plantation, three miles above Donaldsonville, early this morning with fifty men, and left with about fifty stolen mules and horses. He started all the mounted men he had left him in pursuit, only an hour behind. As Whitaker will undoubtedly retreat down the west side of Grand Bayou, I have sent fifty men to Grand Bayou from Napoleonville to re-enforce the detachment which took that road, and to communicate the whereabouts of Whitaker. A deserter from Whittaker informs Colonel Fiske that Whitaker came by the way of Grand Lake, Bayou Pigeon, and Grand River, leaving his boats in Bayou Pierre Pass, which empties into the head of Lake Verret. Colonel Sypher has just sent 100 Infantry to The Park to support the cavalry there. I will give you information as fast as I receive it.

Thibodeaux, April 4, 1865.

(Received 4. 25 p. m.)

Colonel Fiske telegraphs me that a courier from the detachment sent in pursuit of Whitaker has arrived, who reports that our party came up with Whitaker's rear guard just as he was crossing Grand Bayou and recaptured ten mules. He reports heavy firing about a mile and a half to the front. It is believed to proceed from our force sent out yesterday, with whom Whitaker is engaged. Colonel Fiske has sent orders to his pursuing party to follow as long as possible.

Yours,

R. A. CAMERON,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers, Commanding District.

Lieutenant MALONEY,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General, New Orleans.
