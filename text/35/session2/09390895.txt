the District of Columbia:
S. No. 558. A hill to provide for the care and preservation

said cities;

ing the Capitol; and

ten days to take up for consideration bills which
I think it is important should be acted upon.
The bill S. No. 558 is a bill to provide for the

town. The other is a joint resolution for procur-

rounding the Capitol.

Mr. BRIGHT. Then I shall call it up to-mor-
row morning. I am unwilling to contend against
the chairman of the Committee on Finance every
morning for priority of business, and I select
this as a better mode of considering the question
whether the Senate will act on these bills or not.
