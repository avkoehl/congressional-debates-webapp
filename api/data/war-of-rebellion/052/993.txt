LONG'S SPRING, September 9, 1863-7.40 p.m.

General R. W. JOHNSON:

The enemy are reported as having evacuated Chattanooga and to be moving southward. Our corps is ordered in pursuit. General McCook directs that you move camp by daybreak to-morrow on the road to Winston's, thence up to the mountain and toward Alpine, Ga. Your troops will move with three days' rations in haversack. All supply and baggage wagons will be placed in rear of the division under a strong escort, supply the troops if necessary.

When you get to Winston's you will leave baggage and supply wagons behind, taking your ammunition train with you. General Davis' trains are also left behind as rapidly as practicable. General McCook expects that your division will be able to cross the entire mountain by to-morrow. The road up the mountain at Winston's is the best road of the train will be left with it at Winston's.

General Davis' artillery (what he did not take out with him to-day) and a portion of his ammunition train are to be moved up the mountain at 3 a.m. to-morrow. They are to be moved off the road on the mountain in the morning to enable your troops to pass. The general wishes you to take charge of both artillery and trains, and move them forward with your division to-morrow, so that General Davis can get them to-morrow night or next day.

Assistant Adjutant-General and Chief of Staff.
