I will endeavor, as these lower fords may not be good, to get hold of part of Sigel's bridge trains, so as to make the passage as free as possible.

Part of General Sigel's force, under previous orders, is passing through the town at this moment. The general himself has not come in. My aide-de-camp is searching for him in the front with his orders.

I have just received your telegram of 5 o'clock a.m., directing me to ascertain in some way or another whether the enemy be really in force at Waterloo Bridge.

My corps, as ordered, is on the march to Sulphur Springs, and I start in a few moments myself. When I get there I will endeavor to ascertain what you wish.
