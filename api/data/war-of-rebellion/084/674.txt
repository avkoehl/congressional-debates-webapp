HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF NEW MEXICO,Santa Fe, N. Mex., August 12, 1864.

COMMANDING OFFICER,

Fort Craig, N. Mex.:

SIR: Inclosed is a letter for Major Greene. Send it to him by express. Have Lieutenant Samburn and thirteen picked men of his company got in perfect readiness to go with Major Greene, with a good guide, and with twenty days' flour, bacon, sugar, and coffee, no bedding, to go light, and help the major catch the Indians alluded to. Every man must be a Cossack in going lightly equipped, and a hero when the Indians are come up with. Have them ready so that there will be no delay after Greene comes.

Respectfully,

JAMES H. CARLETON,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Send me copies of these letters. I have not time to copy them.

[Inclosure.]

Captain HENRY A. GREENE,

Commanding at Fort McRae, N. Mex.:

CAPTAIN: A. M. Parker, going hence, via Fort Stanton, to El Paso, on the 6th instant, forty miles north from Fort Stanton, had fifty mules run off by some Mescalero Apaches. The Indians probably took the direction of Dog Canon, in the Sacramento Mountains, east of your post. If you will take twelve of your best men and an officer and thirteen of the California cavalry at Fort Craig, with pack-mules, going light, you will cut the trail by going east, and rescue the mules and destroy the Indians. Get your men ready. Order them to some known water to wait for you, then come to Craig at once for the other men, then unite your party and go ahead, and good luck attend you.

Yours,

JAMES H. CARLETON,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Colonel GEORGE W. BOWIE,

Commanding District of Arizona, Franklin, Tex.:

COLONEL: Since writing to you the letter stating that, in case Mowry came to Arizona, to arrest and send him under guard beyond the limits of the department, I have thought it better that you send word to Colonel Coult first to notify Mowry that unless he leave the department he will be sent away, as he is regarded as an enemy of the United States. In case, then, he does not go, he will be placed beyond the limits of the department, unless he has permission to remain in it from higher authority than myself. I regard his presence in Arizona as dangerous to the peace and security of the people. He was once in correspondence with rebel authorities, and may again be guilty of like treasonable practices.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAMES H. CARLETON,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
