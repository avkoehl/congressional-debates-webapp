Mr. SWANN. I will say in reference to this:
bill that 1 have had no opportunity, although
the State of Maryland is deeply interested ia
its provisions, to give it such examination as
would enable me to vote intelligently on the
subject. It contains one important feature
which I desire to bring to the attention of the
House 
Mr. WELKER. I do not know whether
this discussion is in order.
Mr. SWANN. I ask the gentleman to yield
to me for one moment. I have no desire to
discuss the general provisions of this bill; buE
we may have an opportunity to do so here-
after.
This road proposes to cross the branches of
the Baltimore and Ohio railroad at two points.
It is a measure, Mr. Speaker, in which every
man, woman, and child, not only in this Dis-
trict, but in the whole traveling community, i&
more or less interested. If it is proposed to-
pass it before sending it to an appropriate com-
mittee, I wish to submit an amendment to
guard the traveling public against the danger
to which they will be exposed if the billshould
pass in the sha.pe in which it comes from the
Senate. 1 speak as a railroad man, that it is
a measure of the greatest importance. Where
one railroad crosses another there should be
thrown around it such guards aswillgive ample
protection to the traveling public. We have
no such guards in this bill; and I beg the
House to pause before they pass upon it, untii
it has been submitted and duly examined by
the appropriate committee. I will suggest, if
the gentleman will permit ms, that it be re-
ferred to the Committee for the District of
Columbia, as the route is laid out in this Dis-
trict; and it would require the particular exam-
ination of that committee in order to make it
conform to the regulations of the District of
Columbia in regard to its system of railways.
Mr. WELKER. One word in reply to the
gentleman from Maryland, [Mr. Swann.] He
is looking at a printed copy of a bill passed by
the Senate of the last Congress. That bill has
been entirely modified, and the bill which now
comes from the Senate sets forth the line of
the road. As I understand, the objection the
gentleman makes to the bill is simply that it
crosses the line of the Baltimore and Ohic?
railroad, and he says proper guards are not
made against danger from crossing that road.
If this is referred to the Committee for the
Districtof Columbia, asl have proposed, I pre-
sume the matter will be properly attended to.
The question was upon the motion of Mr,
Ingersoll to amend the motion of Mr. Wel-
ker, so that the bill shall be referred to the-
Committee on Roads and Canals.
Mr. COBB, of Wisconsin. I would ask both-
the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. Ingersoll]
and the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Welker]
to withdraw their motions to refer, and to
have this bill now put on its passage.
Mr. INGERSOLL. I have no objection to
that, and will withdraw my motion.
Mr. COBB, of Wisconsin. I hope that this
bill will now be put upon its passage.
Mr. WOOD. This bill has never been con-
sidered by any committee of this House-.
Mr. WELKER. I will withdraw my motion
to refer, and let the bill be now read and put
upon its passage.
Mr. WOOD. Having served upon the Com-
mittee for the District of Columbia during the
whole of the last Congress, 1 desire to say that
we had before us parties who objected to the
passage of this bill, under the circumstances
