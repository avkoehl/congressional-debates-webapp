Colonel SHAFFER,

Chief of Staff:

Orders received at 2.05. The two 30-pounder and two 20-pounder Parrotts are now here being put in position. The ammunition also has arrived. We shall open immediately. As the line is much weakened of its best guns by this transfer I would suggest that their places be supplied from City Point as soon as possible.
