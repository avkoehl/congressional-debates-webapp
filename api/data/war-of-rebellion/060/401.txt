Captain WILL RUMSEY,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

CAPTAIN: I have the honor to apply to you for instructions how I shall act with refugees who are coming into our lines to escape the draft. They report that every person capable to bear arms from sixteen to sixty years of age will be conscripted into the service, and in consequence thereof refugees are coming in daily; they have nothing to eat and seek work. They also state that a great many more are preparing to enter our lines. Some 30 or 50 are reported to be on the road hither from Rockingham and Augusta Counties, and are expected to be here about middle of next week. Please inform me what I shall do with them as soon as possible.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. MOOR,

Colonel, Commanding.
