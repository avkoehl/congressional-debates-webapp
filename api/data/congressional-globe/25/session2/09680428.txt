little eke to expect than plunder and blood, or
chains Then let them go il; we will look to our-
selves and our own resources
A word to the honora le member [Mr South-
gate] from Kentucky, who with some zeal address-
ed the House on this subject, and I "-hall have
ceased to notice what of rancor and madness have
fallen from the Opposition in this dtbate
This ¡.enlleman has denounced the office holders
as horae-li-eches ami blood suckers I could com-
mend to the gentlenuen, that striking fable of the
fox and the swailon, its moral may not be very in-
applicable to the present occasion "Drive not off i
thos-e, (said the witty reynard to the swallow,) wnose
appetites aie torged and filled, for there are others
wailing, more lank and hungry, thirsting for blood,
to fill whom might ethaust my already depleted
veins "
Ay, s r, there are already lank and hungry ex-
pectant office hun  rs and seekers m v ait ior the
spoils, for whicn they nave so long yearned,and en-
vied others the possession of II is that possession,
let me tell ihe gentleman from Kentucky, that is
the head and front of their greatest, olackes', and
abominable <. i mes—it is the office—tho cflice—trie
iffice with i's spullVl that I want before I can be
recorciltd to in s or any oiher Adin 11  r«iuo i Can
there exi«t a Government without oft fluidez
I doubt it, unless we revolutionize this Govern-
ment, and ha\e a puie monarchy, and wouid all be
ruled by the will ir caprice (f one man, el e ofn
cers and oíhcs ho Itrs we must have, and surely
the freemen of America are not yet so much hum-
bled by bank dicta as to be ripe for a monarchy, and
expel iheirofhee hokkrs,this I cannot, nor will not,
torture myself mio the belief of Perhaps gentlemen
are not aware of the extent to which their ultra doc-
tires le<d
I h ill now call the attention of the House, for a
few moments longer, to what I conceive to be the
merits and objects ot the bill on your table, which
ha« been so math denounced and violenilj opposed
by the Opposition in Ibis, House. Ii has been in-
tr< duced witn .in intent on of reliev ng bo'h tne
G nerninent and t e pe ip'e This is tne merit to
wh ch i ísertí' ed, if i answers the purpr e of its
fi e ids It isiniem'eu to relieve t' e rrerchintsthat
are >ndebte 1 to Government, by enab irg i to give
furtaer mduige ice to tntm it is i uended a'so,
to aid the Bdiik of the Unit d Slates—that hidmus
monster of ingratitude and coi'upaon It is lntd ded
as a relief to the deposite banks, by aliening them
lunher u dügeuce, and theieb} t enable each to
grant further indnlgerce to tie people who may be
their debtors and to enable me States to refund the
amounts lome i them w ithout prxdoung cusiress or
embantósnent to the coantry
Such T-e the objects ot t'ni bill that has met the
btt!ere«t opposition ard vilest denunciations from
the Opposition, the self-styled Whigs, as a war
against the banks Eut fi r this attempt fo induie"
andgive relief to al' that aie interested, there would
have been no n eessity (or this me¿-ure If die
Governmei)t was to proceed to co! ect its dues, it
would mevitab1} bnng about that state ot distress,
embanassment, and ruin, that has been so often
piedicted, and *io doubt, in my mind, so greatly
desired by the friends of the banks and the ene-
mies of the Gov rnment Nothing, m my judg-
ment, would gue them more p'easure than to see
th s at'empted b/ me Government It woald, ior
the first ture irake them all prophets, b\ realiz ng
tb* i w sí es nd predictions Sir, this the Go/em-
inent cannot be fcnW to ao, eUher b> the threats
or machinations oí its enen tes
At this moment, this Government which has
been so often tiunt ngly denounced as bankiupt,
insolvent, and vitnouf a dodar, has the following
sums due to its Trcasui\
Due on mercante bonds about        -   «j7 000 000
From 'he United States B ink            -     6 OtlO.OOO
From the deposite hanks       -           -      S 000 000
From loans to the States       -           -   23 000,000
And from the deposite banks
6,000,000
Making an aggregite amount of  *4o 000,000
It will be seen there is due from the Bank ol the
United States        -           -           -   $5,000,000
Making an aggregate amount of $11,000,000
More by f 1,000,000 than the whole amount of
Treasury notes that are proposed to be issued for
the relief of the country Then if the banks had
not failed to have performed their offices, as public
agent', there would have been neither necessity nor
apol igy for the bill of relief which is now before
this House. If the Government has been embar-
rassed, it has been effected by the sole action of the
banks, and is attributable to both their faithless-
ness and inefficiency, as public agents, yet, with all
this odium attached to them, as the sole authors of
all the mischief that has befallen us by their sys-
tem of deception, and priestcraft policy, they have
never faded to shuffle it off on the Government,
and thus divert public attention from the mischiefs
they themselves have effected, by charging it to the
acts of the Government
The next question is, shall we issue these notes,
or boirow the money, wlnoh is now required for
immediate use, or to force the Government to col-
lect immediately its dues from the merchants, the
States, the deposite banks, and the Bank of the
United States Thit ihe issue of Treasjry notes is
the most appropriate and remedial course there can
not be a question senously entertained bv any,
whose object is mgoodfaiih, apart from party cjn-
sidetdtions, to assist the Government in its relief of
the people conuected with those nieut íuteiests
Sir, collection is out of the qussuon, and the ri^k
and expenses and uncertainty of borrowing, and
the unnecessary creating a national debt when we
have the money due the Treasury, to the amount
of forty-five million of dollars, and know not how
soon we may be able to collect a sufficiency for
the purposes required, it does appear to rue, would
not on!} be impolitic hi the extreme, but the height
of madness to adopt, and which could only find fa-
vor, at this time, m the blindness and rancor of
the mo«t reckles* party «pints
But, sir, this has been made too manifest by
others fir me to dwel on now This subject has
been investigated n another branch of tin  bod),
(the Senate of the United States,) in a most mas-
terly manner There the Opposition have been
met, man to man, and the great Ajax of their party
has Deen foiled and routed upon every subject of
the finances of the country
In point of argument, I bel eve their best friends
and mist <.rdent partisans tirnk them defeated,
overuhelmed, and routed, horse, foot, and dra-
goons The policv of these measures has been so
e'early demonstrated m that bodj, that it would be
supererogation m me to attempt now to go into
their examination, wi'h a view of adding any thing
new The reasons for, and objectio is to them, aie
before the people, and they will, if they have not
already decided o i their merits
Mr Sneaker, I will no  notice a single charge
against the ftiends of this bill, of being arbitrary n
wishing an early action on the measure    To show
with what an  ill mien,  and awkward  one,  the
marge of mbdiaiy power comes from  the gentle-
men ot that body, I b-g to hat e tne journals of
the House read in re ation to the motion made to
lay tne Independent Treasury Dili, that was lately
sent us fioui the Senate, on the table, immediately
on its introduction into this Hou^e, without refe-
rence, or allowing its friends one moment to dis-
cuss oi even examine it, either  n pnnc pie or de-
tail       [Objections    being    raised,      immediate-
ly cries from all quarters of the Opposition, "No,
no, no," were heard, and the Speaker was about
putting the question on the  reading oi the jour-
nals ]  When Mr B said, I will withdraw the re
quest, sir, since mv purpose has oeen fully effected,
bv nearlj the whole pany object t.ig to hear ther
names read out, who voted, u ith an undivided
phalanx to lay that bill under such circumstances,
on the table, without giung to its friends one
'  mmute to examine or discuss, it     I was aw ate that
I this objection would be mads    I knew that gen-
I  tlemen would be unwilling to sit quiet and hear
their moons stency published to the world without
remonstrating against it    Yes, sir, these are the
men who now gibe and prate   about aibitrary
power, ever leady to blow hot or cold, as best suits
the purposes of their party, or their own. <u(>vc-
hience. This shows the character of their pro-
fession and practice, their duplicity and the double
parts that are carried on here for political purposes.
Such as this, connected wiih other acts more
daring, has often led me to say, that I should tot
be at all astonished at any course they might par-
sue, here or elsewhere, and that they were prepared
for any sort of a revolution or bloodshed, to get
themselves into office. Their whole thirst is for
power and place, and but for the intelligence, pa-
triotism, and virtue of our people, they would long
since have bad this mighty Republic involved in
the most devastating and bloody revolution, to ef-
fect which, it has long been my deliberate and can-
did opinion that the leaders of that party have been
prepared, and have waited only for the sanction of
the people, to attemp' it. We have heard already,
from high quarters, the invocation of "war, pesti-
lence, and famine," rather than a continued exclu-
sion from ofnc° and from power With such feel-
ings and sentiments have they enlisted thousands of
hungry expectant hordes under their banners, only
waning the ripening of public op'nion by misrepre-
sentation and corruption, to sanction tne perpetra-
non of their deeds
INDEPENDENT TREASURY BILL
REMARKS OF~MR. PICKENS,
Oí    SoeTH   CaKOLINI,
In the House of Repiesenlalives, June 19, 1833—The
bill to provide lor the collection, safe-keepmg,
tranfer, and disbursement ol the puouc revenue,
being under consideration in Committee of the
Whole on the sta e ot the Union,
Mr PICKENS rose and said
Mr Chairman    In the remarks wh eh I propose
to address to this committee, it will be my object
and desne to avoid dwelling on those topics that
I urged on a ioimer occasion when this subject
was under consideration, and also to avoid, as lar
as possible, touching upon those pointy which have
been elaborated with so much ability on a recent
occasion in the othei end of this capítol.
The provisions of the bill under consideration
aie plain and simple. Its leading traits are, 1st,
to separate the Government from all bank agency
in the collection and disbursement ot its revenues;
2d, to cohect gradually, in smalt portions, through
a term of about seven ) eais, those revenues m the
constitutional currency of the country It pro-
poses, in tne execution of this design, lo use four
principal receivers, with moderate salaries, and
nine additional clerks, with salaries not to exceed
two thousand dol ars each It secures their faith-
fulness by ample bonds and security. It makes it
a crime for any of them to use directly or indirectly
any of the public moneys, except under the direc-
tions, of law, and punishable with fine and im-
prisonment and the forfeiture of bonds The who'e
appropriation required to provide proper places for
the safe-keeping and disbursement of the money,
is the sum ot $10,000, and the annual cost, salaries
and all, will but little exceed $25,000 These are
the features of this bill Aud now, I would ask,
where are the monstrous forms in which it has been
clothed i Is it a cume fot this Government
honssdy to take caie of its own revenues? Has it
come to this, that we dare not throw off the agency
ot banks w ithout incurring their denunciation, and
the bm-r curses of a thousand presses that live and
ffourish under the patronage flowing from their
stupendous and seducmg sj-stem 1 Did the fathers
of our Constitution ever dream that this Govern-
ment which they were forming was necessarily to
be made dependent upon corporations which were
to spring rp m so short a time in every State and
Terr tmy of this republic One of the great aod
leading objects of its iramers, was to relieve this
Government from this dependence for revenue
upon the States, which formerly existed under the
old articles of confederation And the clamor now
is, not ¡hit we propose to make our revenue inde-
pendent of the Stales, but of the moneyed corpora-
tions of the States
We are surely m a singular position.   Gentfe*
men who are imbued with feeling and syjjf af/
