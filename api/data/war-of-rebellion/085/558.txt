small party of enemy drove my vedettes on the Southwest Branch from Catawissa a few minutes since, believed to be about fifty of the enemy. They captured 3 of my men. Have sent out a party to find out what they are, and recapture the men if possible.

Colonel MERRILL,

Franklin, Mo.:

Your dispatch of 8 p. m. received. If attacked by a superior force defend yourself to the last, and follow up with your cavalry. I will probably march to join you at once. Communicate with me freely during the night.

A. J. SMITH,

Major-General.

FRANKLIN, October 2, 1864--10.30 p. m.

Major General A. J. SMITH:

I will be able to hold the gap east of the town until your arrival, no matter what attacks, and will not leave my present position, about a mile this side, unless compelled to by a superior force. Am getting anxious about my reconnoitering party on the Union road, which should have been back before this. If it does not return within an hour I will send another strong reconnaissance on that road. Will keep you fully informed of all that is of consequence. Am well prepared to meet an attack if it comes.

LEWIS MERRILL,

Colonel, Commanding.

FRANKLIN, MO., October 2, 1864--11.45 p. m.

Major General A. J. SMITH:

My reconnaissance from Union has just returned, having entered the town and had a little skirmish with a body of the enemy in the town, capturing a lieutenant of engineers and a private, both belonging to Marmaduke's division. I cannot get much out of the lieutenant as yet, but think I will get him drunk enough to talk before a great while. The private says that Marmaduke's division is the rear guard of Price's army and passed through Union about 4 or 5 o'clock this afternoon. They have four divisions--Marmaduke's, Fagan's, Shelby's, and Parsons'. Marmaduke's, which is said to be strongest, has four brigades, one of which is Cabell's, the force which attacked this place and which I estimate at 1,600 or 1,800, though perhaps it was two brigades that attacked here. They went out on the road to Jefferson City, and are said to be camped ten miles out from Union. The whole force has no doubt passed through there leading toward Jefferson City. If I can get anything our of the engineer will inform you; he doubtless has valuable information if he will tell it. I lost 1 horse killed; the enemy 2 wounded. The town was so full of their men that the lieutenant commanding my party considered it prudent to retire with what he had got.

LEWIS MERRILL,

Colonel.
