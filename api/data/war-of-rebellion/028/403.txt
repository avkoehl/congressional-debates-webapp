HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,Near Knoxville, October 8, 1862-7.40 p.m.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

I have moved my headquarters to this place to-day. I am pushing everything as rapidly as possible to get ready for the advance. All the information I can get indicates that the enemy not only hold their position near Winchester, but that they are receiving re-enforcements, probably conscripts, from Richmond, by way of Staunton.

GEO. B. McCLELLAN,

Major-General.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

I have understood that Brigadier-General Gorman has applied direct to the War Department to be relieved from duty with this army. If this be so, I respectfully request that the application may be acted upon at once, as I wish to place Brigadier-General Sully in command of his brigade.

GEO. B McCLELLAN,

QUARTERMASTER-GENERAL'S OFFICE,

Washington City, October 8, 1862.

Major General GEORGE B. McCLELLAN,

Headquarters near Sharpsburg:

I telegraphed yesterday that there are in depot here, at Philadelphia and New York, about 1,250 hospital tents. Do you want them, and where and when? Is there not danger of burdening your army by care of too much such property, if sent forward at this time? The railroads are now embarrassed to supply you, and here supplies wait for the return of cars detained still loaded near your position.

M. C. MEIGS,

Quartermaster-General.
