HEADQUARTERS SIXTH CORPS,June 1, 1864-2.10 p. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

The last division of the corps in moving in, and as soon as in position I shall press my skirmish line forward, to develop strength and position of enemy. At present I cover the Bethesda Church road, the Gaines' Mill road, and the road to Dispatch Station, with both right and left refused. When General Smith comes up I will throw forward my right as the basis of his formation. I don't think there is anything of moment in front of my right, though it is the point where the enemy attacked, but on the Gaines' Mill road they seem attack as soon as I can get my pickets forward.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General, Commanding.

[Indorsement.]

Major Riddle states that when he left General Wright at 3 p. m., General Smith was with him and General Smith's lead of column was up.

HEADQUARTERS EIGHTEENTH CORPS,June 1, 1864.

Major-General WRIGHT,

Commanding Sixth Corps:

GENERAL: The enemy are reported as massing on their left and in front of my right for an attack early in the morning. This by deserters. It is, therefore, of vital importance that I have all the force I can get, and must ask that you send my two regiments to me as soon as possible. I am authorized by General Meade to call upon you for ammunition. I want 85,000 rounds .57 caliber, 8,000 of Spencer, 2,000 of caliber .54. Can you send it to-night?

Very respectfully,

WM. F. SMITH,

Major-General.

SIXTH CORPS,

June 1, 1864-7.30 p. m.

General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

Everything is going well up to this time. We have gained upon the enemy on the right, and hold our own on the left. We have taken many prisoners. It is reported by them that a large [force] of the rebel army is in our front, and I think that you should send me re-enforcements to-night, if possible. I shall attempt to extend my left to the Chickahominy to-night. The result is not yet decided.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General.
