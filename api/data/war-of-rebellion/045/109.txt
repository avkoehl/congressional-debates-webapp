Brigadier-General KELLEY,

Harper's Ferry, W. Va.:

Tyler informs the general commanding that

at nightfall he will fall back to Williamsport, and from thence to

Harper's Ferry. It is important Milroy should know this. Send trusty scout with it, in cipher, if possible.

DONN PIATT,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Chief of Staff.

HARPER'S FERRY, W. VA.,

June 14, 1863-9 p. m.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Nothing from Winchester to-day, neither from the enemy nor General Schenck. Heavy firing at Martinsburg heard for one and a half hours, ceasing at dusk. Telegraphic communication ceased at 7 p. m., and result not known. Enemy reported at Berryville and Smithfield. My force here is not as large as it should be, yet the troops are in good spirits, and will give a good account of themselves.

B. F. KELLEY,

Brigadier-General.
