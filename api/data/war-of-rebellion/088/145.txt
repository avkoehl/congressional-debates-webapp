that three division of infantry went to Early in the first part of the week. Great secrecy was observed in the movement, and the troops were taken through the city mostly in the night. The inquiries that he made resulted only in learning that they were Longstreet's division. Yesterday he was a train of artillery, which he describes as being about three-quarters of a mile long, cross the river from the Manchester side, and was told by Mr. Barnes, a prominent merchant, that they were going to the Valley. He thought that yesterday on his return there was greater activity at the lines and picket posts than on his way up. At the point where a road from Malvern Hill intersects the Charles City road he saw a small boat an a Government wagon coming from toward the James River.

I was away when your dispatch came. Field's division cannot have left our front, as I have here General Law's adjutant-general of that division, captured night before last. Nothing, I am satisfied, has left the front of our lines save Kershaw's division.

I have quite positive information that every regiment of Lee's army, save Pickett's division, is under marching orders to go to the Valley. Kershaw has left. I have information to-night, by deserters just received, that Hampton's cavalry all went through last night. From two different deserters, from two different division, I have it that Heth's division, or a part of it, has gone through. From three different men I have it that every regiment of Lee's army, save Pickett's, is under orders to go north, and that he is ordered to report to Beauregard. Please ascertain about Heth.
