HDQRS. ARTILLERY BRIGADE, SECOND ARMY CORPS, October 12, 1864.

Major SEPTIMUS CARNCROSS,Assistant Adjutant-General, Second Corps:

I have the honor to report that yesterday in front of Batteries Nos.13 and 17 the working parties of the enemy were observed strengthening their second line. They were opened on whenever they showed themselves. At about 7 p.m. the enemy opened a heavy fire from their mortar batteries in front of Fort Stedman. This was replied to by our mortars with great vigor, the fire continuing about one hour. At 9 a.m. the enemy opened on our picket-line in front of Fort Davis with artillery. Our guns and mortars replied. The firing extended as far to the right as Fort Morton. This ceased in about thirty minutes.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNumbers G. HAZARD,

Major, Commanding.

Major A. F. BROOKER,Commanding Siege Battery, Artillery Brigade, Second Corps:

MAJOR:I wish you would put two more 8-inch mortars in Battery No. 20. The enemy are shelling that part of the line severely, and those now there do not seem to be able to prevent its continuance. I would like to see you to-night or to-morrow morning if you can come up. Two men were killed in Fort Sedgwick by the enemy's mortars last night.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNumbers G. HAZARD,

Major, Commanding.
