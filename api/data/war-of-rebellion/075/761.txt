Major-General HINDMAN,

Commanding Division:

GENERAL: The lieutenant-general commanding desires me to say that you will not re-enforce the brigade you have on picket, but make it develop the strength of the enemy, if possible, before retiring.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

HEADQUARTERS HOOD'S CORPS,In the Field, June 6, 1864.

Major-General HINDMAN,

Commanding Division:

GENERAL: The lieutenant-general commanding directs me to say that it was intended at first for General Cleburne and yourself to alternate in doing the picket duty on your front, but as General Hardee has a whole division on picket, you will have to keep a brigade in your front all the time. You can keep a brigade continually on picket, our relieve it as often as you please.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. W. RATCHFORD,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS HOOD'S CORPS,In the Field, June 6, 1864.

General J. C. BROWN,

Commanding Stevenson's Division:

GENERAL: The lieutenant-general commanding directs me to inform you that the enemy are reported to be at Davis' Cross-Roads; he wishes you to take every precaution to prevent him from surprising the brigade you have on picket, or coming on its flank.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. W. RATCHFORD,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS HOOD'S CORPS,In the Field, June 6, 1864.

Brigadier-General BROWN,

Commanding Division:

GENERAL: The lieutenant-general commanding directs me to say that you can keep any brigade of your division that you please. He does not wish you to re-enforce the brigade on picket, but should the enemy appear in your front, to make him show his front, if possible, before you retire. General Hindman has a brigade on picket on your right, and General Stewart one on your left. The instructions to each of these, including yours, are that they will not fight the enemy long enough to be cut to pieces, but make him develop himself, if possible, without severe loss on our side. He wishes me to say, also, that he has no fears of General Pettus' brigade becoming panic-stricken.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. W. RATCHFORD,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
