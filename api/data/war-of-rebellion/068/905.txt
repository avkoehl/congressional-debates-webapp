MAY 18, 1864.

General HINKS:

The extra ammunition is for Lieutenant Lambert's 12-pounder Napoleons. There are thirty boxes. It is stored near the wharf. I have ascertained pretty certainly that the enemy had 600 cavalry, two howitzers, and one or two companies of infantry.

DUNCAN,

Colonel.

General HINKS:

The enemy just brought down three ambulances, one howitzer, and 30 men. He turned into the woods opposite Mill's house. He is probably after his wounded. Might not a cavalry force intercept him on the middle road?

DUNCAN,

Colonel.

MAY 18, 1864.

Colonel DUNCAN:

The horses are so used up I cannot send out any cavalry.

HINKS,

General.

FLAG-SHIP AGAWAM,

Trent's Reach, May 18, 1864-4 p.m.

(Received 5.40 p.m. 19th.)

Honorable GIDEON WELLES,

Secretary of the Navy:

At daylight this morning the enemy were seen entrenching the heights at Howlett's house, commanding Trent's Reach. They per-severe vigorously under gun-boats' fire, and will erect guns to-night. Monitors cannot reach them. Beaumont, commanding Mackinaw, reports his pickets driven in at Dutch Gap Heights, lower side, all rebel artillery getting into position there. Eutaw, Blake commanding, from City Point, reports army pickets driven in there. My communications much threatened.

S. P. LEE,

Acting Rear-Admiral.

PORTSMOUNTH, May 18, 1864.

General SHEPLEY:

All quiet this morning. Major Gates states that it is reported that three companies were seem during the night. Nothing in sight
