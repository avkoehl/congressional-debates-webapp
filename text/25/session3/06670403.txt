removal from office ? Why pats ¡(iin to enact that the
application oj public money by an officer of Govern i
mtntto piivale uies shall be a felony?" Will reports I
ói statutes avail anything* Vain and idle' they
would the more cloak and conceal and piotect
these plunderers' The President, if he will, may
say, as the Duke of Vienna, disguised as a fnai
in his own capital, that he might ovetlook the
actions of his people-
" My business m tins State
Mide me a looker on, Here in Vienna,
Whore I hive «cen corruption boil and bubble
Till it o'errun the stew    Lams far all faults
Bat faults so countenanced, that the strong statutes
Stand, like lorteits in a b irber's shop,
As much in mock a* marl "
Pass any pams and penalties, adopt any sys-
tem of laws you please—United States Bank, pet
bank system, sub-Tieasui y—and let me ask if
eithercould be expected to woik well in the hands
of such men who " -countenance" such "faults''"
Sii, we aie told by that philosopher m govern-
ment, William Penn, that the best system will be
as the worst if badly administered by bad men,
and that the wpist system will be as the best, if
righteously administeied by good men Yes, sir,
a change of men is what is wanted—a general
tum out of all faithless trustees and servants
I mus>t bring my lemarks to a close—I am
aching fiom «ly head to my hips     But, sir, did
I tell the truth or a falsehood in 183G     Have the
Executive Depaitments been conducted with m
tegi ity and ability' Let evei y honest man answei
Add the defalcations of Swartwout, Pi ice, Gra
tiot, Reckless, Boyd, Hams, Linn—the whole
list, and tell me how much was stolen in 1836'
But, sn, it is all to be thrown on the poor banks'
How much m default have the banks been5 The
Seeietaiy's annual report says
" First A list of the banks still indebted lo the United
States for defaults previous, to the close of 1834, none of
winch are believed to have given originally any collateral
secuntv, is annexed, [M ] ibewhoh amount now due
without conrputinginterest,pquals$i,000,676, and a great
part of this must be regarded as a total loss
" Secondly Another list of indebted banks is annexed
most of which gave collateral security, [N j Pile lemain
mg dues fiom them to tbe Treasurer, on d( faults accruing
between 1834 and October 1837 though at first very large
have been reduced to about $2,400 000, and most, it notan
of the«e debt , with someothets, owing to public disbursing
officer  for money on deposit, it is confidently expected
will m the end be piid
" I he first installment due from those which have since
executed othei bonds and given new security under the del
of October, 1837, has been promptly met nud portions of
the second have alieady been advanced by some of them
Suits are pending against only two, on aceount of their
liabilities "
According to this, nothing has been lost since
1834 by banks How much by sub treasuieis'
The same íeport says
" Thirdly The eventual losses sustained from receivers
and collectors, while, as a pait of the bank depositsystem,
tliev weie collecting the pul lie funds, to be afteivvatds
placed for safe keeping m banks were at the last session
estimated at a sum ranging from nine to twelve hundred
thousand dollars
' Collateral security had generally been taken of these
officers, but, m former times, it was not always in so hrge
amounts and with so great care as of late, and consequently
mo t of the foi(gomglo« es happened many yeais ago
" A list ot all those officers who, on the 12lh of October,
1837, the tune designated in the r< solution ot ihp House ot
Representatives stood on the books of the Treasmy ash tv
ins: neglected to «eltle their accounts i isiason may be seen,
wuh tile amount charged to each, in the printed report madP
on the loth January last (Doc No 111) liut several of
the e were not then actually indebted to the United Slates
thowrh having neglect d to adjust their accounts at the
Treasury, thev Came within the express words oí the íeso
lution, and consequently were included "
Here, sir, you mayjadge of the truth and jus-
tice of this officei 's repots He íeports losses
by receivers and collectors at from nine hundred
thousand to one million two hundred thousand
dolíais only, when we know that the defalcations
of Swartwout alone exceed the largest sum ' Su, .
the banks aie to be blamed, whether they lost or
embezzled the public moneys or not, but the only I
sin of sub iieaiuiers is in bans; caught ' They may
pick and sien/ rif pleasme, but they aie especially to
bcwai e of detection' The Administration Says as to
them " Better let it he'" Phillips even intimates
that it iá all owing to the banks' Sir, the last in-
quiry is what aie to be the consequences and
effects of these defalcations'
I have nothing to say no w as to the public mor-
als or public credit    They are subjects above
these timos No, sir, no I learn what is to be
the effect here—here only—by listening to the Ad
ministiation's shout of those old worn out, hum-
bug watchwords, £c economy1 retí enchment' ie
foim<" After the President and Secretaiy have
permitted all the public money to be stolen, after
they have stimulated and encouraged the Govern-
ment and the people to the utmost extiavagance,
aftei laising expenditures to $40,000,000, and cre-
ating another public debt, they now, fiom neces
sity, prudently recommend to our patience and
self denial a becoming economy' economy'—that is
the woid
The fact is, they must starve and be disgraced,
unless they reduce expendituies They turn, now,
fiom eloctioneeung with the public money, aftci
it is all spent, and electioneer, m turn, with the
watchword economy'—economy ' And upon what
is this economy to fall' What objects are to be
made the victims of defalcations and financial
bankruptcy '
Sir, we aie told by Mi   Secretary that some of
the most beneficent appropriations are to be ai
rested     The States were led to expect that they
would receive the fourth installment of yout dis-
tnbution act — an act, by-the bye, foi   winch I
never voted, but would now execute to the letter
Why'   Because you,  by your own voluntaiy
legislation, led them to expect the facilities winch
the act afforded, foi the promotion of their sys
terns of internal impiovement and education, and
they have been led to legislate on the faith of youi
action here    Now, we are told, then hopes must
be disappointed, their systems of moial and phys
ical impiovement anested, and the ordinal yap
piopuations here to like ob|ects must be stopped,
and why' Because the office holdeis have squan-
dered and mn off with the public trcasuies'
And, sn, the system of light houses is to be de
stroyed, in corfoi mity with the policy and interest
of this Administration—to put out the lights' The
eyes of commerce aie to be put out 01 blinded, to
support the extiavaganceand profligacy and frauds
of office holders ' Sir, during the past disastrous
fall season on the Atlantic coast, the shoiesof my
district ha\e been litei ally strewn with wiecks fiom
the íagmj deep. A few days befoie I left home,
$ 150 000 worth, at least, of diy-goods, was float
insr on the sand beaches of Noithampton county,
Virginia, fiom the wiecic of a single brig Foi
years I had been endeavoring to have a light house
put neai the very spot wheie this vessel bilged
upon the bai A laige caigo of cotton, and sev
eral other wrecks, came ashoie, to remind us daily
of the improvements necessary on our coast to
piotect life and property A stai of the ocean is
needed on almost every promontoiy, as much as
the notth star in the vault of the sky, but they
are all to be dimmed, and never to give light to
the sea braten mariner, because Swartwout and
Puce and Gratiot, et id omne genui, have carried
off the means of buying the lamps'
This is not all The widows and orphans of
your revolutionaiy heroes and patriots aie to be
depnved of their bread earned by patriotic toil
All pensions are to be stopped for the sake of para
sites and public plundeiets The people are to
be denied all the blessings and boons of their Gov-
ernment—and for what' To pamper your pie
tonan bands, vour legions with the means of good
living and display; to tempt the Swiss corps who
long for their portion of the spoils, to furnish
your renegade Democrats with millions lo sport
their fraternity of defaulters in the splendoi of
Europe, to endow your Boyds with principalities
of the public domain and mints of public money,
to bribe and buy upenough of the mercenary and
vile in the land, to retain for you the power which
you have ignomimously obtained, and which
you have flagrantly abused, and the placeswhich
you have faithlessly filled and shamefully dishon
ored '
This is but an epitome of the history of youi
outrages upon the morals, the law, and liberty of
a still glonous country, which you are degrading
to the bondage of a money power, which you pro-
fess to abhor—a country which you are ruining
by an absolute Executive, which you do profess to
woiship ' If the fatheis of the country could now
use fiom their tombs, and enter this their temple
—" which should be called of all nations the house
of" liberty—what would they say'   What was
said to the money changers in the temple at Jeru-
salem—" But ye have made it a den of t'neves'"
And, sir, what think you would your chief puests
and sciibes say,even to them ' What they have
said to me " By what authouty doest thou these
things '" But, sn, I cannot say of your pi iebts
and scribes as is said in Holy Wnt of the Jew-
ish—" Theyfeaied the people'" No, sn, your
auogance has sui passed all fear, all bounds of
caution. If the people do not soon make you fear
them, you will be past the remedy of reform by
their power
Why not make your economy fall upon the
salaries of your " ttained bands," your office-
holders > Go for a reduction of salaries, m that I
will support you Sir, the other day, when the
Globo published the debate in the Senate upon
economy—economy echoed by your party there—
it contained, in almost immediate juxtaposition,
an advertisement of poor Gratiot's furniture
j Here it is   the Globe, you know, as General
! Jackson says, never lies' Heie it is

"EDWARD DYER"
How many pooi "unwashed and uncombed"
children in your district and mine, sir, would this
costly furniture of a splendid defaulter educate'
How many sons of unworthy sires would it raise,
elevate in virtue above the price of a Price > Sir,
the substance of the people, their education; their
commerce, their systems of improvement; their
funds of honor and gratitude, are all to be sacri-
ficed to the appetites of con upt partisan harpies'
Such, sir, are the consequences of your great and
glorious, immaculate " economy, retrenchment,
and reform Administration'"
Sir, " in piping times of peace," the great ser-
vice a Rcpie&entaüve can render is (o sarje the
public money I have faithfully endeavored to
discharge this duty, to save the public money
fiom wicked rulers, and to preserve the purity
and virtue of both the people and their servants
fiom the temptations of a splendid Government
and a wicked Administration If I have done
nothing towards this end, it is not my fault The
task has been a hard one I have had to labor at
the oar against wind and tide, against a most
powerful and popular President and party, against
you, sir, your committees, and this House But
the blaze of glonfication is espied Thank God,
the day star dawns from on high There is now
hope of salvation, an hour of retributive justice
is coming, Truth, though slow, is coming grad-
ually along with her torches ' I have been wait*
mg for her long, but never without hope I hare
had to carry my life itself in my hand, the harness
of deerskin and cold steel and iron has often
galled my shoulders, an armed arsenal against
the king's forces—they are dangerous when there
are such rich spoils, but I have escaped unscathed,
thank God' though my slanderers and persecu-
tors and renters would have the world believe
