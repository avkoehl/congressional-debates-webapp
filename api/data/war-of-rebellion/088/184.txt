troops to you. I have taken therefore the liberty to halt the column now filing past your late headquarters. Can we not get out better by the head of Three-Mile Creek; of course, this is but a suggestion, not an order, as you are under Hancock's orders. I will order forward the column as soon as the officer who takes this returns, if you desire it.

Major-General.

General BIRNEY:

The only dispatch received for you was that the junction of Four-Mile Creek and New Market Creek* was the position he desired you to take. I replied to General Hancock that you understood it and was about to make the advance if practicable. The dispatch of General Hancock was received at 3 o'clock, dated 1.15 p. m.

Major-General BIRNEY,

Commanding Tenth Corps:

Dispatch received.+ All honor to the brave Tenth Corps. These six guns and the two mortars will make a gap in the enemy's lines by which I trust you will go through. You have done more that was expected of you by the lieutenant-general.

CAPTAIN: If you can take such a position as will enable you to shell the junction of the Kingsland and Varina roads, I shall be obliged it you will do it. General Hancock says you have the range.

D. B. BIRNEY,
