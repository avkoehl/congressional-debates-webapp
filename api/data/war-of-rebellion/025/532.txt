HOLLY SPRINGS, MISS., January 4, 1863.

Brigadier General C. S. HAMILTON, La Grange, Tenn.:

A scot just in reports that there are but few troops at Pontotoc. Van Dorn is said to have gone east, and is collecting all the cavalry and Partisan Rangers he can.

Dodge says also that he understands a division of rebels will be at Jacinto to-morrow night. Roddey is at Tuscumbia. Probably they will join in a raid. Have your cavalry ready for a pursuit if necessary.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.

HOLLY SPRINGS, MISS., January 4, 1863.

Brigadier General GREENVILLE M. DODGE, Corinth, Miss.:

Scout just in from Pontotoc. Found out nothing reliable, but report said Van Dorn had gone east; was getting up all the cavalry and Partisan Rangers he could. He evidently means mischief. I will direct rations to be sent to you as fast as possible, and order Sullivan to send you forage.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.

HOLLY SPRINGS, MISS., January 4, 1863.

Brigadier General J. C. SULLIVAN, Jackson, Tenn.:

Van Dorn has gone east from Pontotoc, and is gathering all the cavalry and Partisan Rangers he can. Roddey is about Tuscumbia. The probabilities are that he will be heard from about Corinth, Bethel, or Bolivar. Have the two latter on their guard. If possible, send Dodge forage promptly.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.

HOLLY SPRINGS, MISS., January 4, 1863.

Major General J. B. McPHERSON, Abbeville, Miss.:

It looks evident that Van Dorn, Forrest, and Roddey are going to unite their forces and attack Corinth, or make a general raid upon the roads. Van Dorn is now marching toward Jacinto. Roddey is at Tuscumbia and Forrest back of Savannah. There is no special object longer in holding the Tallahatchie. You may therefore fall back as far as you can to-morrow.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.

McPHERSON'S, January 4, 1863.

General GRANT:

General Sherman has had a severe time of it. I hope Banks got there in time with his re-enforcements, so that the place is ours, so the war can be carried into the heart of Mississippi. I will move my command back, as directed, to-morrow, leaving Colonel Leggett's brigade and one battery at this place.

JAS. B. McPHERSON,

Major-General.
