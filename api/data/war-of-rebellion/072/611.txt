men of the regiment I desire saying they did their every duty and did it well. Major Carter was ever at his post until stricken down; Captains Jenkins and Perry, and Lieutenant Osborn were also struck while in the very front. The color bearer (Lance Sergt. George W. Field, Company C) was instantly killed as he planted his colors on the railroad bank. They were taken up and carried throughout the balance of the action by Lieutenant Joseph W. Redding, Company D, whom I would especially mention for his gallant conduct. The regimental color was carried safety through by Sergeant Owen, Company I. The losses in the engagement were 1 officer and 7 enlisted men killed, 3 officers and 25 enlisted men wounded, and 1 enlisted man missing. For recapitulation of casualties of the campaign, I respectfully refer you to accompanying sheet marked B. During the entire campaign of four months, although exposed to almost continuous fire, hard labor, and marches, both officers and men have at all times acted with alacrity, energy, and cheerfulness.

Very respectfully, your most obedient servant,

D. F. GRIFFIN,

Lieutenant Colonel, Commanding Thirty-eighth Indiana Vet. Vol. Infty.

Lieutenant H. O. MONTAGUE,
