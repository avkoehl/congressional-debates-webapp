impolitic and illegal The Department is, there-
fore, engaged in making provision foi the trans-
portation oí the gieat southern mail by other
means after the 1st of January next, not being at
liberty under the law, even if it we'e otherwise
disposed, to accede to the teims demanded by the
railroad companies This cannot be done on the
same line without publicmconvemence in the loss
of time, and although a uval line may be raised
up m the course of a few months fu'Iy equal in
speed, yet it will not be so convenient to the
Department, or in all lespeets so useful to the pub-
lic as the one in question But having offered all
that the law admitted, and more than pjstice and
good policy would have sanctioned had no law
been passed, the Department does not feel itself
in any way responsible for the public inconveni-
ence which may ensue
These details ha\e been given that Congress
may correct the constiuctton given to the law of
last session if too liberal 01 too strict, or íesort
to such fuither enactments as the publ c interest
may seem to require.   The punciple that Con-
gress may constitutionally make loads foi   the
transportation of the mails, once entei tamed by
some, seems to begeneially abandoned, but that
they may use for that  purpose  all loads  con
structed under the autilouty of the States, has
hitherto been universally conceded     The char-
ters of railroads are granted for the public con
vemenee, and in their constitution theyaie con
sidered  so far public that private propeity is
taken at a valuation for their use without the con-
sent of the owner     Whether these roads are to
form an exception as to the right of use vested in
the United States by the Constitution is a quea
tion which it may soon become necessary to con
sider

nature of the building now occupied It has a
ehmgle íoof and much wood woik within, and m
the Department and the Auditoi 's offit e there are
daily about seventy fires It is, perhaps, m
greater danger from the proximity of stables and
other wooden buildings which could hardly burn,
in some directions ot the wind, without involving
the whole stiucture occupied by the Depaitment

Sir in conformity with instruct ons if eived
from the War Depirtment, dated on the 25th of
September, lS,j«, I havt the honor to piebtut the
following statemen's and letnrns
First—A statement showing the orgamzmon of
the Army,
Second—A geiertl retuin of the Army,
Third—Ditíiu jution of the tioops in the eastern
dmsion,
Fourth—Distribution of the tioops in the west-
ern division,
Fif'h—A return showing the number of troops
under the command of Brigadier Geneial Taylor,
serving m Florida against the Seminole Indians,
and
Sixth—A statement showing the number of re-
cruits enlisted m the Army, fiom the 1st January,
1838
Since my last annual report, the Army has been
actively emoloyed, m various quarters, and m
varioasways Although it is not m my power to
state that the war in Flonda against the Seminole
Indians hf>s been brought to a close,theie is every
probability from the extreme misery to which the
fndiars ha\e bcei ¡educed, and the indications
they haie maiiife-tfj to surrender, that the war
wnl not be of long continuance A report of the
operations in Florida, up to the close of the corn-
Report of the Major General of the Army,
mand of Major General Jesup, has been made to '
you by that officer, and was laid before Congiess
at its last &eabion, and printed by the authority of
that body
Previously to his withdrawal from the command
in   Florida, Geneial Jesup reported that  active
operations would necessarily cease by the 30ih of
April, in consequence of the climate, and that a
portion of the tioops would be available, during
the unhealthy season, foi service elsewhere, orders
where therefore given for tne four regiments of
aitillery acting as infantry, and one regiment of j
mfantiy, to march into the Cherokee country and ¡
repoit to Major General Scott, to be employed, if |
necessary, in obliging the Cherokeeb to fulfill then
treaty stipulations in reference to their removal
to the country alloted to them west of the Missis-
sippi
Upon the retiring of General Jesup from Flor-
ida, Brigadier General laylor, the officer next
in lank there, was assigned to the command At
the close of the campaign, nearly all the volun
teei foice in Florida was discharged, leaving in
that lemtory the whole of the second regimentof
dtagoons, the first and six'h legiments of mfan-
tiy, and some Flonda volunteers This foice
was distributed among the ptiticipal depots, and
the stations along the boidets of the settlements,
to guaid the supplies and aflord protection to the
inhabitants, most of the imeiior posts being
abandoned, experience hiving shown that they
could not be occupied dunrg the summer and
pait of the autumn, without gieat sacrifice oí life
Dunng the past summer, altnough the tioops
were kept in continual commotion, the enemy,
scattered in small bands, succeeded in commit-
ting several muiders, which, on a line of fiontier
so extensive, could scarcely have been ptevented
In the month of April, a battalion of the sixth
regiment of infantry was sent from Tampa to St
Maiks, to prevent a junction between some
Cieek Indians, who had ciossed the Appalachi-
cola, and the Seminóles, and to emigiate the
Cieeks, il possible A tew of these Cietks aie
in our possession, but the most of tl em aie still
in the swamps cf the Appalachicola and Ockloc-

I ted some murdeis in that ¡state I ive companies
of legulai  tioops and one ot Geoigia volunteeis

I[ to the inhabitants, and, if possible, to dislodge the
, enemy, besides wlucti, the Governor of Georgia,
I   at  his sugges'ion, was authou/ed   by the War
Depaitment  to   call   into  seivice a íegiment of
militia, for the better piotection of the exposed
I settlements On the 31st of September, the Gen-
eral was visited at Tampa by the pimcipal chiefs
i o' the Tillahassees, with seveial sub chiefs, who
piofessed to be anxious for peace, and pledged
themseHes to come in fot emigiation by the 20th
j of Octobei, and to bring in with them their people,
and to send íunners to the Ockefinokee swamp to
■  get the fugitive Creeks, said to be twenty-two in
I number, to join them     It was the opinion of the
General at that time, that there was decidedly a
■  better feeling among the Indians, as regards emi-
gration, than had been manifested since his arrival
in Flouda Early in October, the General re
paned to the Appalachicola river, with a view of
obliging the Appahchicoia Indians to fulfill their
promise oí removing to the West, and also to take
measures to get in the fugitive Creeks secreted in
that section of the country.   On the 2G\h of the
Senate & Ho. of Rfps.
month, the day stipulated, he succeeded in em-
barking the whole of the Appalachicola Indiana
on board of a steamboat foi their new homes.
He, however, gamed no intelligence respecting the
fugitive Cieeks On the 30th of October, the Gen-
eral reports from Fort Harlee, on his way to
Tampa Bay, that he had received letters from that
place which he could rely on, of the most satii-
factoi y character, as to a portion of the hostile
Indianscommg in for emigration This informa-
tion did not prevent the contemplated movements
of the troops into the country, and the occupancy
of such positions as would tend to hasten the sur-
render ot the Indians still remaining there Two
of the regiments of artillery, and one regiment and
one battalion of infantry have been ordered to re-
ínfoice thearmym Florida,and two hundred and
forty-seven leermtsarenowon their waytoTampa
by the Mississippi route The force in Florida
may, therefore, be computed at about three thou-
sand two hundiedand foity regulars, and three
hundred and seventy militia.
Colonel Lindsay, of the second regiment of
artillery, who was in command of the forces as-
sembled  in  the Cheiokee countiyat the date of
my last lepoit, continued on that duty until early
in April, when Majoi General Scott assumed, by
ouiei  ot the War Depaitment,   the direction of
aiTiirs m that quarter
|      i he ( herokees were lequred, by their treaty
stipulations, to commence emigiatmg to the west
of the Mississippi on the 2ád of May; but it being
I apprehended that they would not commence their
lemoval at the time stipulated, unless compelled
| to do so, a strong regular force was assembled in
1 their country ami placed at the disposal of Geneial
Scott, who  was also authorized   to call on   the
I Governors of the States interested in the removal
' of the Cherokees,  for such militia  force  as he
mis'ht deem necessary, not exceeding foui  thou-
sand men     The disposition  which the Genera!
mide of his troops was such as to convince the
I Indians of his determination to enforce the terms of
the tieaty, and relying on  the disposition of the
General to oblige them to yield to those teims, a 
well as on his disposition to protect them in their
peisons and property, the Cherokees submitted
to his dnection, and peaceably depaited for the
countiy allotted to them in the West, as fast as
cncum&tances would permit.
In the month of January information was re-
ceived that unlawful combinations of persons on
our noi them fiontiers were forming for the purpose
of mterfenng with  the Government of Canada,
and joining with the disaffected in that country in
endeavoring to subvert the existing government,
in violation of the treaty of peace between the
United States and Great Britain    It being deemed
| necessaiy, on account of these combinations, to
senda military foice to thefrontiei to guard against
| an mfiaction of the treaty, Major Geneial Scott
was duected to proceed to Buffalo,and to take the
direction of affins along the frontier, and there
being no other disposable íegular troops, the re-
cruits in depot were foi met! into detachments and
, foithwith dispatched to the frontiers     On General
I Scott's arrival on the Niagaia he found the line
i guaided by about sixteen hundred militia of the
1 State of New Yoik, called out by order of the
I Governor, a thousand of which were received into
I the United States service, but subsequently, with
the exception   of  a few companies, discharged.
i With  Brigadier General  Brady on the   Detroit
I frontier, and Bngadiei General Wool on the Cham-
plain and Vermont frontiers, and with the assist-
I anee of the civil authonties and the officeis of the
revenue, General Scott, aided by Colonel Worth
and Major Young, was enabled to frustrate every
open attempt to violate our friendly relations on
the bolder   Too much praise cannot be bestowed
upon the officers and soldieis, and others engaged
m this service, for their zeal and activity at that
particular juncture, and in the midst of the rigors
I of a northern winter, in the effectual performance
| of so arduous a duty
I     Order being restoi ed about the mu'dle of March,
and the militia discharged, Geneitl Scott, as beff re
i stated, was ordered to take tne dnecuon of affana
in  the Cherokee country     The legu ar troops,
however, remained on the frontier, in order to
I check any renewed attempts at crossing the line.
