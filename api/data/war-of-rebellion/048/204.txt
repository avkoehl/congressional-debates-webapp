Captain Myers informs me that he sent you the information you desire. I think there is no doubt about there corps having been sent from Meade's army to Rosecrans. The river is again very strongly picked.

SIR: I have the honor to report that, pursuant to order from division headquarters, a party of 100 men of the First Pennsylvania Cavalry, under Captain McNitt, scouted the country toward Warrenton.

When about 4 miles from these headquarters, and 1 mile outside the pickets, this detachment was attacked by a force of rebel cavalry, variously estimated at 100 to 150 strong. After a short skirmish, in which our loss was 2 men wounded, and that of the enemy 1 man taken prisoner and 2 horses killed, they retired on the Greenwich road.

Major Russell, First maryland Cavalry, now joined his 100 men to the force of Captain McNitt, First Pennsylvania Cavalry, assumed command of the whole, and proceeded to Warrenton, where he found no enemy. He returned to Warrenton Junction, thence to camp.

There is no change on the picket line.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

HORACE BINNEY SARGENT,
