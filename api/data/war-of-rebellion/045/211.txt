as early as practicable, and rejoin as soon as this is accomplished. He has also been directed to send for his wagons, and have the men of his regiment who are with them escort them down. Seven hundred men under McIntosh will leave Alexandria to join you tomorrow morning. Ewell's division is said to have crossed the Potomac River at Williamsport or Shepherdstown. General Tyler, at Sandy Hook, so reports. The general is apprehensive they are holding these gaps to cover the movement. The general wishes you would find out if Longstreet's corps has passed through Middleburg or Union, and crossed any of the gaps in the Blue Ridge. The general is rejoiced to hear that you are doing so well. He is also very anxious to know if any of the enemy's infantry columns are moving in any direction, and in which direction they are moving. The First Corps, General Reynolds, has been ordered to Goose Creek. Stahel's cavalry are being concentrated and sent over the river into Maryland. The Eight Pennsylvania Cavalry have to picket here, Bristoe Station, Gainesville, &amp;c., and they cannot be spared. At present, Meade is at Aldie; Howard on Goose Creek. If you want any support, call on these officers, and inform the general of it.

Very respectfully, &c.,

DANL. BUTTERFIELD,

Major-General, and Chief of Staff.
