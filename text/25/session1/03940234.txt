Making public officers depositories—Mr. Tallmadge.
Senate.
The tendency of th & scheme is to bring the
countiy, virtually, to an exclusive metallic cur-
rency Whatever gentlemen may say on this sub-
ject, this wild ?nd visionary ihcorj is gaming
ground with a certain portion of our population
It is propagated by reason of the countenance
which it is supposed to receive from men in high
places Meetings have been held m New Yoik
and elsewhere, at which an exclusive metallic cur-
rency has been reached on as the only true policy
All paper money of every description has been
repudiated, as contrary to the genms of our Go-
vernment and the spirit of our institutions In the
same resolutions, men m elevated stations haie
been applauded by nine for maintaining the same
doctrines The proceedings of such meeti igs have
been responded to m terms of approbation, theieby
tacitlj acquiescing m all the pr nciples set forth in
them, and thus giving currency to them w uh the
people. It is the belief that such pr nciples are
recognised by those to whose approval they are
submitted, that excites the alarm and apprehension
which pervades the rational and thinking portion
of the community It is this, too, which gives
countenance to thr idea that the Sub-Treasury
scheme is intended to bring about an exclusive
metallic currency The suggestion of the Secre-
tary of the Treasury may also go far to confnm it.
He says
" The people of the whole United Stales do not,
in a sound state of business and prices, need over
one hundred and ten millions of an acti\e circu-
lating medium foi all their cunenev This would
be a larger proportion of cunency to our piesent
population than the aveiage has been from the
adoption of the Constitution, and, if an inclusive
metallic cutrency could be deemed desnablc, would
require only about thirty millions moie than the
specie which is supposed now to etist m the coun-
try "
It is tiue, the Secietary Joes not lccommenl
this, but, undei the piesent '-tat ol thi is,s, hunks
" some paper will, probabl), always be found con-
venient for commercial opermons " Still it will
be perceived, that if, by this scheme, or any other,
banks can be dispensed with, then, m the opinion
of the Secietary, we should, with Unity millions
more of specie, be able to transact the thousands of
millions of business oí this íapidlv increasing and
enterprising country. Those who make such esti-
mates seem to overlook the fact, that the note* of
banks and specie togethei form but a small part of
out actual circulation, loi, m one sense, doirestic
exchange is a portion of the cucuhlion, and a \eiy
large portion too, vei> iat exceeuing the ag^regite
of bank notes and spe-ie This kind ol emula-
tion is essentially promoted by bank facilities and
bank «edits. So that, by dispensing with banks,
although you should have th- bundled and ten
millions of specie, jou would cm tail, to a most
destructive extent, the domestic exchange, wh ch,
after all, forms the principal circulation
But whether an exclusive xnttall c cunency be
intended or not, this scheme «ill, il adopted, vn-
tually accomplish that object I will take the cit}
of New York, for example My remaiks will ap-
ply, m the ratio of business, with equal foice to
every other portion of the Union New York col-
lects about three fifths of the whole revenues of
the Government accruing from customs They
have amounted, m some years, Iron fifteen to
eighieen millions of dollar-, But let us assume
the year 1834, which the Secrelaiy tak°s as the
critenon for future years In fiat year the le-
ceipts at New Yoik for customs amounted to some
twelve millions of dolíais Now, I ask, how is it
possible for the merchants of that city to pay that
amount m specie? In wnat way can they com-
mand if Even if they cou d procuie it, it wi u d
be by withdrawing it iron circulation from olher
parts of the counti \, orbv taking n fiom the banks
where it is the basis of circuht.on ->s udl as the
basis of confidence to dep isitoi If tnis amount
of specie was to be disbursed immediately af ei its
receipt, that would, in a measuie, obvi i'e the diffi-
culty, so fai as New Yoik is concerned But it is
not so disbursed We all know, as a gene ral rule,
that of the appropriations for the j ear, there i e-
mavns sometimes one-half of the amount in the
shape of " une v v nded balances," at the close cf
the jeai Oí couise there mist remain a la'ge
amount of the money which is received into this
Sub-Treasury unexpended Th.s amount, there-
fore, is taken out of circulation, or from the banks,
and does not again go into cruilation nor into the
banks The receipts are much greater and more
rapid than the disbursements So that theie must
remain a large sum on hand which can not be dis-
bursed Let no one, then, be deluded with the
idea that this is to be a constant íound of receipt
and disbursement It is no such thing I have
examined the statements of the amount standing to
the credit of the Government m the deposite banks
in 1834 I find the permanent a\ erage balances to
be about five millions of dollars, whin, at the
san e time, th°re was not half that amount of spe-
cie in the \ a tits of all the banks in the citi Here,
then, we see five millions of dollars, m the shape of
permanent average balances, beyond all disburse-
ments, ' salted duwn" in this Sub-Treasury vault,
ol no more use to the Government oi to the peop e
than if it was cast "into the bottom of the deep,
where tathom line ha« never reached dip ground "
Sir it is impossible that this system can be carried
into effect m the city of New York The mer-
chants cm not command the sjiecie , and if thev
could, it would be diawing it from (list int pai ts of
die couiury, and the vaults ot t le banks, by which
the w holt coursi of business would be disturbed
and deranged, from New York to the remotest
points of the Union I have said that about five
millions of dollars would remain as a pnnanent
aveiage balance in deposite beyond the disburse-
ments of the Government Oí the amount of twelve
millions collected at New Yoik, according to the
above estimate, about seven millions would be dis-
bursed But even this disbursement is not made
where the money is collected In 1834, in the
whole State of New Yoil , only $1,650 000 «as
d shin ed uitlnn lis lim ts We heie haie the as-
tounding fact, that while the city ot New York
pa\s 0,1.2,000 000, and $,7,000,000 of that sum is
disbuiscd, oil} 'U,Gr>0,UO0 is pud out within the
State I am not complaining that a larger sum is
not expended there, for those expenditures must
be made w here the interests of the country require
them , but I am complaining of the proposed sys-
tem, by which you require this enormous amount
to be paid m specie, when so small a portion of it
is pud out «here it ts collected But it is better
that it be disbursed elsewhere than not disbursed at
all And wc have already seen tnat about
ls>000,üü'ü must rennn in peimtnent deposite,
1 e}on 1 the amount disl utsc d, and thus be buried,
like the talent oi the unprofitable servant, wheie it
is of no use to the Government nor to the people,
but of detriment to loth But once ad pt this bu-
njil system, and wheie will you find ths resunec-
tionaiy r ouci that can call back to li<e the hourly
i icreasing deposites m this fiscal charnel-house 1
It is said, however, h> gentlemen, that this mo-
ney belongs to the Government, and that the peo
pie have no n.ht to the use of it Is this not an
additional evidence oi tne attempt to separate the
Government fiom the people? Isthsrot the mo-
ney of the people1 How does it become the monej.
of the Government, as contra-distinguished from
the people? The Government oi the offieeis of
Government are the agents and servtntsof the peo-
ple They are mere trustees to execute ceitain
powers commtled to them, this money is collected
fiom the people by direction of the people them-
s-l es, not for the puipose of beinghoaided up, but
to De used for their benefit in the d souisements of
the Goiernmen , ai d to plomóte the great interests
ot the countiy To hoaid it is contrary to the spi-
Ht of om mstitu'ions and more espec.alH when
its cu todj ana control are given to Executive off-
eers, wheie it m¿) le used foi smistei puiposes by
unuortrn incumbents Such a principle has neier
attained befoie in tl is country, the surplus revenue
col ecttd from the people beyond the wants of the
Government, has always been placed in a situation
to be used tor die benefit ol the people This has
been done by depositing it with the banlt>, which
hav e undertaken, in consideration of it, to perform
certain duties to the Government, m the way of col-
lections, transmissions, and disbursements, without
charge Tnis fund thus deposited, beyond the re-
gu'ar disbursements of the Government, became,
through the banks, a useful agent m the legular
commercial business of the country It is collected
from the merchants, and it i  perfectly proper that
they should, in this indirect w ay, have the use of it
in their regular business transactions By this
means the whole community ieels the benefits, for,
whatever aids the merchants m their operations,
must oí necessity aid, in the regular course ef bu-
siness, every other class in society The merchants
are the mere lactors or distributors foi the other
classes They are the agents, and any benefits ex-
tended to them are for the ae vantage of their prin-
cipals Sir this idea of locking up this money is a
new one It has not prevailed heretofore, its adop-
tion non, however, is no more strange than the
proposed system which is under discussion It na-
tuially results from it, and the one can not be car-
ried out without the other Piesident Jackson, and
all ihe friends of his administration, opposed the

n s nutions to lock up m vaults the ueastire t f the nation

would be scarcely moie dangerous to their liberties than to
