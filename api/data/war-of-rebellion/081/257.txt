HDQRS. DEPT. OF VIRGINIA AND NORTH CAROLINA,June 20, 1864-2,45 p. m. (Received 3 p. m.)

Lieutenant General U. S. GRANT,

City Point:

General Weitzel has just returned from a careful reconnaissance of the position at Deep Bottom. He reports the problem as of the most difficult solution, and not capable of a thoroughly satisfactory one. The best position would bring the bridge under close artillery fire from commanding positions, and the work itself would be under this fire. He does not feel justified to decide what to recommend, and suggests that Colonel Comstock be sent over and look at the position with him, or for such other instructions as we may be favored with.

BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Major-General, Commanding.

CITY POINT, June 20, 1864-3.08 p. m.

Major-General BUTLER:

I shall start a cavalry expedition to-morrow night or the following morning to cut the enemy's lines of communication south, and want all of Kautz's force that you do not require to accompany it. General Wilson will take with him all of the cavalry under General Meade's command present, except a few hundred for provost duty. Please direct General Kautz to report to General Wilson to-morrow for this service.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

CITY POINT, June 20, 1864-3.25 p. m.

Major-General BUTLER:

Neither Colonel Comstock nor General Barnard are here to accompany General Weitzel on a reconnaissance over the river. I think General Weitzel had better give the problem the best solution he can, and after occupying the north bank of the river we can occupy also the ground commanding the fortifications and bridge, or can make any. Change that may be necessary.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

JUNE 20, 1864-3.30 p. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT,

Commanding, &amp;c.:

Orders have been issued to General Kautz to report to General Wilson, near Petersburg, with four regiments of cavalry and two pieces of artillery, prepared to start on an expedition to cut the lines of communication south. My signal officer reports a regiment of rebel cavalry passing the turnpike north toward Richmond.

BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Major-General, Commanding.
