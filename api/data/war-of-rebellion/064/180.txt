Colonel WILLIAMS,

Macon, Mo.:

What troops are in Chariton and Randolph? I hear of great outrages in that region. Hurry up the militia and give Leonard information that H. T. is no longer bushwhacking in that section. Where is Leonard?

NEW MARKET, PLATTE COUNTY,

June 2, 1864-6 a.m.

Captain HOLLOWAY:

I am here, eating breakfast. I staid at Hamlin's last night. Captain Snyder and 40 men are with me. I sent to have Fish's company join me here. There were 20 men here yesterday at noon, the same party who committed the murder and destroyed 16 stand of arms and carried off the rest of them. They left here going in the direction of Camden Point. They say they have been re-enforced, but I can get no reliable information. I will follow them.

Yours, respectfully,

JAS. A. ADAMS,

Captain, Commanding Scout.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF NORTH MISSOURI,Saint Joseph, Mo., June 2, 1864.

CAPTAIN: We are in receipt of your favor of the 31st of May, 1864, and in reply the general commanding desires me to assure you that every possible effort will be made to catch and kill the outlaws who infest your county. Captain Crandall, at Brookfield, has authority to use any or all of the militia of Linn County, if necessary, and will pursue the rascals vigorously. Any information you can furnish him from time to time will be of advantage to the interests of the service.

I have the honor to be, captain, very respectfully,

G. A. HOLLOWAY,
