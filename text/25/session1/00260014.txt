We, sir, jf M sms ppi, do not iclv alore upon—
nay, we do not exp  a— the aid of th s ror a iy other
legislative bods Though the m~ss-ge of the
President has been already denounced ">nd charac-
terised as a loco Jaco document, I will say that if
that doctrine prevailed more Generally than it docs,
the influence of bark la?? would be lessened, the
community less afflicted, and more political honesty

Thegctkman from Virginia tells us, that it was
his province to investigate into the abuses of this
Government, and that one of the great evils was,
that we hid a paitisan press engaged in executing

the Senate, bj the insertion of the words " Commit-
tee on Patents and the Patent Office," was, on his
mo'ion, taken up
Mr GRUNDY stated tint the íeasons which
had influenced the mover of the amendment were
to provide for the appoin'ment of a committee to
have especial charge oí evoy thing i elating to pa-
tents and the patent office, for neither bianch ol
Congress had ever appointed a committee solely
for that putpose In the Senate, every thing con-
nected with the subject had heretofore been refer ed
to the Committee on the Judiciary That commit-
tee however, being almost ahvavs- engaged with
subjects of its own of imp itancc h id frequently
fi unlit impossil Ic to piv tin attention *o otheis
wmih they deserved, and hence the necessity ol
ci eating a committee to take especial charge of all

was the intention of Congiess, at this time, to go
into the general transaction of busines Should
it be then disposition to do so, which he trusted
might not be the case, he would ask to have the
memorial referred to an appropriate committee
How ev er, as he had received the memorial, it v as
his duty to pre ent it He then moved that it be
laid on the table and punted, which was agreed to

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
THORSDiy, September 7, 1837
The House res imed the consideration of the re-
solution, submitted yesterday l> Mr BOON, which
was, as modified b) himself, n these woids
R so'ved, That in the elect on of a punter to the
House of Representatives for the 2oth Congress,
the vote of th  members shall be given ui>« voce,"
the amendment of Mr PATION extending the
principle of voting ma loce, to all other ofucers
app nnted by the House, having been adopted
Mr ROBERTSON moved to strike out all after
he word " resolved," anJ insert the following
1   Resolved, That the pub ic printing ought to be
separated, as far as practicable, from the political
press
2   Resolved, That to afTbid t m° to digest apian,
having that object m vie.v, the Cleik, until further
order, contract for all pn iting ordeied by this
Hou^e, upon the t°rms and in the manner prescrib-
ed by the joint resolution of the 3d M rch, 1819,
distributing the same among the propnctois of the
several printing offices, not exceeding four, in the
city of Washington, w 1 o w ill e ^ecute it on those
terms, providing th*y will undertake to execute it
equall}, or in such propoitions as they will con-
tract to execute it
Mr RoBERTSor  said the question involved in
the íesolution, was on= of deep mtere t, but he
d d not consider this the time to go into a di cus-
sion of the matter, we havi othe and inportant
maiters to take intocoismeraUon, and he hoped the
tune of the House wounl not now I e consumed in
a discussion ol a mattei of this ku d He had in-
troduced the proposition to get rid of the difficulty
in which we have found ourselves involved
This contest for punting appealed to be a con-
test for political power, pnd Horn the manner in
which political pai ties were now divided, it must
be evident that unless one party or the other } íelds,
there can be no union and no election can take
place The object of his proposition was to avoid
the difficulty, for it was not to be expected that
either party would yWd tne ground thev had lal en
He could not see tnat any gentleman could ol jeet
to th s proposition, and he submitted it to the Hoi se,
hoping it might be adopted, because he apprehend-
ed that if the House did not adopt som  such pro-
position as the one submitted by him elf, a great
portion of our session would be spent in determin-
ing the question as to who was to be elected public
prmtei We ha\e o.her and higher duties to per-
form here, than to contend foi the choice of a
printer ol the House, and he therefore hoped that
his amendment might be speedilj pdopted
Mr GARLAND of Virginia, a-,ked the indul-
gence of the House for a moment oi two upon
the subject of this resolution, growm  out of the
peculiar position he then occupied
With regard to the abstract proposition of his
honorable colleague, (Mr Robertson,) he re-
garded it as a sound one, yet he believed
it, at present at least, impracticaole m execution
He thought the public printing should be, if practi-
caba, separated from the pub ic press, but }et the
public press v. ere the political engines of the coun-
tij, and the Government itse'f was a Government
of politics, and it would be as impossible to make
the separation as it nou'd be to separate any thin 
else of the most ebdurate and difficult character"
He should therefore vote against it
In relation to the proposition to dibtiiout  the
printing, he was utteilj opposed to it The House
had one of tn o duties to perform It must either
designate the pubnc punter, or select an agent foi
the perfoimance of hat dutj If n selected an
agent, it must select one w ho could have the print
mg done with neatness, care, and oespatc i, and in
whom they could-confide                             '         a
In relation to another point, growing out ot the
resolutions of yesterday, he wished to say d few
