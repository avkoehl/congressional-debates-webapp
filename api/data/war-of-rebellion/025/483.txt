brigade has been remounted; the horses came from Texas. I have 200 prisoners, taken in the last week. Cannot I send them through the lines? Where is Van Dorn's cavalry?

G. M. DODGE,

Brigadier-General.

HOLLY SPRINGS, MISS., December 25, 1862.

Colonel A. S. NORTON, Abbeville, Miss.:

Have your advance guards on railroad to Oxford drawn in? If they have not, draw them in at once.

The railroad is to be abandoned from Abbeville to Oxford. Keep out guards for defense of Abbeville only.

By order of Major General U. S. Grant:

JNO. A. RAWLINS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

JACKSON, December 25, 1862-4 p. m.

Major-General GRANT:

The road to Columbus is not so badly hurt as supposed. I hold Trenton. My forces whipped Forrest yesterday at Obion. General Brayman beat him off at Bolivar. I think the road will be in running order by the first of next week. I will send a large force in that direction to protect Colonel Webster and his repairs. I have secured jackson in such a manner that all the rebels cannot take it. The surrender of Trenton mortifies me, but the damage to road is not worth grieving about.

JER. C. SULLIVAN,

Brigadier-General.

HOLLY SPRINGS, December 25, 1862.

General SULLIVAN:

Three miles north of Toone's Station are three bridges unguarded. You will at once protect them.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.

GRAND JUNCTION, December 25, 1862.

General HAMILTON and General GRANT:

Mistake about rebels being near La Grange. Colonel Richmond says they were 3 miles below Somerville at 3 p. m. yesterday, giving the impression that they were going to unite with Johnston at Jackson. I will move northward, striking between Bolivar and Somerville. Third Michigan has arrived.

B. H. GRIERSON,

Colonel, Commanding Cavalry.
