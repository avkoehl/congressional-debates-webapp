HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY DIVISION,[August 26], 1864 - 8 p. m.

Brigadier General J. H. WILSON:

Your note received.* Accept thanks. Officer also arrived. Signal officer North Mountain reports column of infantry moving up river from Williamsport, south side. If true it is probable that it is to cross at Dam. Numbers 5 and come down the river to assist in the crossing to-morrow morning. They cannot bring artillery, and the position is fair for us. I intend to see what they do it on, and if you can leave a sufficient guard for the ford at Shepherdstown and start for Hagerstown when the moon rises I shall feel sure of our being in a central position where we can deliver a blow that may hurt. I have written to General Sheridan about it. Please answer.

Very respectfully,

WM. W. AVERELL,

Brigadier-General.
