Lieutenant Colonel H. W. PERKINS,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Twentieth Corps:

COLONEL: I have the honor to report that I am encamping my troops on the east side of this creek, leaving Jones' brigade on the other side to cover the crossing. My trains commenced crossing the stream at dark, at which time the last of the Third Division trains crossed. It will probably occupy nearly all night to get my trains over. In the absence of other orders I will move forward as early as possible in the morning.

I am, Colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNO W. GEARY,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

GENERAL: For the memory of old associations, please let Corpl. M. D. Lacey, Tenth Ohio Cavalry, remain to attend a wounded soldier, one for whom you should have every respect, for he is very brave and a true gentleman. Captain Norton was wounded to-day charging your barricades. Please show him such attention as is in your power, and at some future day you shall have the thanks of your old friend,

Colonel S. L. BROWN,

Q. M., Chief of Forage Division, Numbers 66 Cedar street, New York:

COLONEL: There should be no failure in the shipment of the daily supply of forage ordered for the army on the Potomac, the James, and those expected at Port Royal. The present indications are that somewhere within reach of Port Royal General Sherman will establish his base of supplies. I estimate the number of animals with which he will reach the coast at about 32,000. Your shipments should be sufficient
