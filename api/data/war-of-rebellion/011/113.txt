at all times and assist in the defense of the boats when necessary. This military guard should of course be composed of volunteers drawn from the Army. If this suggestion is approved I would ask permission to nominate the officer who would select and command the guard. The total force on board all the seven steamers and two picket tenders will be, including guards and crew, about 350 men. I wish to have in the fleet two small but swift coal tow-boats as tenders and pickets, which can be purchased here for about $10,000 each, and I would be obliged to you, if the suggestion is approved, to authorize their purchase by the committee. I propose to provision the boats, as is customary on river steamers, at the owner's (in this case the Government's) expense. I ask to be relieved of all financial cares, and to be furnished with a clerk to make the needful purchases and keep the accounts. After the expedition sets out a volunteer surgeon and assistant (if competent men can be had) would be desirable. I will designate the few arms that are needed in a subsequent dispatch.

Respectfully asking for an early answer,

CHAS. ELLET, JR.

CAIRO, April 19, 1862.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

On the evening of the 16th General Pope received an order from General Halleck to move his army immediately to Pittsburg Landing, leaving with gunboats force enough to garrison Fort Pillow, if evacuated by the enemy. Our fleet left Fort Pillow next morning at daylight, and will all pass Cairo during this night. Two regiments were left with gunboats. I report fully by mail, and will go up Tennessee, reporting daily by telegraph and mail, if possible.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

I have reason to know that Commodore Foote has written to the Secretary of the Navy, stating the condition of his wounded limb, with an opinion from three surgeons. As a change may be effected, please have it deferred until you receive a report by mail from me in regard to reorganization.

TOMAS A. SCOTT.

CAIRO, April 19, 1862.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Before leaving the fleet Commodore Foote desired me to ascertain whether steamers were being converted into rams or gunboats at Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, and Saint Louis; also the number at each place and the time they will be ready. If he is to provide commanders and crews he must be getting ready. Please telegraph me at Cairo.

THOMAS A. SCOTT.
