Captain L. M. DAYTON,

Aide-de-Camp:

Lieutenant Hunter, who had command of the advance guard of the squadron sent toward Holly Creek Mill, is just in. He reports that one mile and a half this side of the mill Captain Robinson, commanding the column, was attacked in the rear by a force estimated at 500. Lieutenant Hunter went to the mill, crossed the creek, turned west and reached Tilton with the advance guard. Captain Robinson and his men have not reported. Citizens estimate the force variously at from 500 to 2,000.

Colonel RAUM:

Have you not force enough to go out to Holly Creek by night and bounce that party? It is there to cover a courier line back to Hood. I suppose General Steedman to be now up about Charleston and Columbus, and that Wheeler must go north or on into North Carolina.
