I would also say to you that Heathsville has been for a long time a depot for smugglers, and that Richmond traders frequently come there to lay in their stock of merchandise.

It is unnecessary for me to give you the localities of different places, roads, &amp;c., You have more facilities than I have to know of them; but should you thin of anything that I might be of service to you, please command me.

Respectfully, &c.,

J. L. McPHAIL,

Provost-Marshal-General, State of Maryland.
