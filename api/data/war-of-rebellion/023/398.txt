HEADQUARTERS, Decherd, August 23, 1862.

General ROUSSEAU, Huntsville:

Mr. Anderson is ordered to send two trains to take the infantry between Columbia and Huntsville to Nashville. One of these trains is to stop at Athens, the other to go to Huntsville and report to you. You will at once take this train in person and proceed to Athens, taking up the Nineteenth Illinois. As soon as you get to Athens have the Twenty-first Ohio taken on the other train and then move with both trains promptly up the road, taking up all the bridge guards and the companies at Elk River and Pulaski. When you get to Columbia order General Negley to march with the force there to Nashville and pick up all the detachments on the road.

Order the senior colonel at Huntsville to take command and hasten the shipment of the supplies from that point. As soon as the last train of supplies leaves he must send an officer to see that that train as it goes to Stevenson picks up the Tenth Wisconsin and brings it with the stores to this place. As soon as that train leaves Huntsville the commanding officer there must bring the whole command by forced marches to this place. Have all this well understood. On getting to Nashville you will take command and defend the place to the last and try to open our communications with the north. If we are cut off you know our condition and wants.

When you relieve the infantry at Athens order the Third Kentucky Cavalry now there and at Pulaski and a company of scouts also at Pulaski to march direct to Decherd. This must all be done with great secrecy and promptness. Answer.

JAMES B. FRY,Chief of Staff.

HEADQUARTERS, Decherd, August 23, 1862.

General ROUSSEAU, Huntsville:

Use the bacon. You will have to leave the sick and medical attendants with rations for twenty days. When the force at Huntsville marches, direct it to march by way of Fayetteville and Shelbyville to Murfreesborough instead of coming here. If you can't get your trains through you must leave them and march through.

JAMES B. FRY.

HEADQUARTERS, Decherd, August 23, 1862.

Colonel SHOEMAKER, Commanding, Stevenson:

Expedite the shipment of stores from Stevenson in every possible way and be ready to evacuate the place at a moment's notice. Let engineers quietly prepare the pontoons for burning, and when you leave destroy everything that cannot be brought away.
