Brevet Major-General KELLEY:

Young Rowe, the operator at Weston, escaped the rebels and left there this morning at 10 o'clock. The rebels, about 5,000 strong, under Echols, left there early this morning for Buckhannon; they boasted that there were 4,000 of rebels besides themselves, and that they intended to stop things and take Clarksburg certain.

Brevet Major-General KELLEY:

Mr. Arbuckle, late captain Fourth West Virginia Cavalry, has arrived from Weton, where he was during the enemy's occupation. He says the forces were entire strangers, commanded by Colonel Wilkes [Witcher], and 800 strong; were mounted and heavily armed. They represented that Echols and Johnson would reach Weston to-day. His report otherwise agrees with young Rowe as to reported rebel forces being in this county.
