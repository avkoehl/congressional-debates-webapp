His Excellency A. LINCOLN,

President of the United States:

Notice resignation of Secretary Stanton, and see it intimated that General Butler may be his successor. For God's sake give us Butler, and my word for it the loyal people of the Northwest will all say amen.

J. L. WRIGHT,

Chairman Union Central Committee, Indiana.

WASHINGTON, D. C., July 20, 1864.

J. L. WRIGHT,

Indianapolis, Ind.:

All a mistake. Mr. Stanton has not resigned.

A. LINCOLN.

Captain LUBEY,

New York Volunteer Engineers, Jones' Neck:

I have ordered a box of carpenter's tools to be sent you. That bridge calls for so much more material than I expected that I will first confer with General Butler. General Foster will furnish you the infantry detail and axes without doubt when you tell him what it is for. Can't you build the bridge entirely of corduroy or logs so as to be passable? Have a talk with Foster about it.

G. WEITZEL,

Brigadier-General.

DEEP BOTTOM, VA., July 20, 1864.

(Received 8.50 p. m.)

General WEITZEL:

I can build the bridge with logs and corduroy, but it will take longer time to do it. General Foster will give all the men I require. He has only 100 axes, the majority of which he wants to use cutting slashing. Please order the depot quartermaster at Jones' Landing to furnish me with a few teams daily. I will also want spikes and nails. The width of the creek is about 1,500 feet.

T. LUBEY,

Captain, &amp;c.

DEEP BOTTOM, VA., July 20, 1864.

General WEITZEL:

SIR: The engineer's work at this post is completed.

S. C. EATON,

Captain of Volunteer Engineers.
