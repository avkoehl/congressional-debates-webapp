Major-General BUTLER,Commanding Department of Virginia, &amp;c.:

GENERAL: Captain West succeeded in getting on the railroad with 10 men, and found himself between a company on one hand and a battalion on the other. The battalion were drawing rations. He contented himself with capturing 1 man, and withdrawing without injuring the railroad. The prisoner reports himself as belonging to a South Carolina regiment just arrived from Charleston. General Heckman's total loss to-day was 7, 1 being killed.

WM. F. SMITH,

Major-General, Commanding.

I have not yet heard what General Brook's loss is.
HEADQUARTERS EIGHTEENTH CORPS, May 7, 1864-3.30 p.m.

Major-General BUTLER,Steamer Greyhound:

One of my aides has just returned from General Brooks and reports that after some sharp fighting succeeded in reaching the railroad, and at the time my aide left was commencing the destruction of the road, having already cut the telegraph. His advance had reached a bridge across a creek which they were about to fire. He reported that after this was done he would return with his command. With such a meager report at present, I can only mention the names of General Brooks, General Burnham, and Colonel Dutton, the latter of whom has kept in the skirmish line all day and was engaged in overseeing the destruction of the bridge. We stand now in pressing need of rations, and of axes and artillery ammunition.

WM. F. SMITH,

Major-General, Commanding.

MAY 7, 1864.

General SMITH:

A deserter captured from Richmond, and a citizen says Lee and Pickett dangerously wounded; Jones and Jenkins killed; uncertain at Richmond which got the best; say Grant fell back short distance.

Major-General.
