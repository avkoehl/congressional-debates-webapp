On this long and arduous campaign too much praise cannot be bestowed upon the private soldiers for their patient and uncomplaining endurance of all the hardships, deprivations, and toil that have fallen upon them. The distance traveled, although nearly 500 miles, was as nothing in comparison with the labor, delays, fatigue, and loss of rest required in corduroying roads, building bridges, and by exertion of all manner of skill and strength, helping along our immense train of wagons and artillery over the poorest of roads and through a low and swampy country at the most inclement season of the year. Though often kept out in the mud and rain until midnight, only to renew the same task in the morning, all the obstacles, hardships, and difficulties seemed only to call forth fresh zeal and new exhibitions of that wonderful power of adaptation to circumstances that distinguishes the Yankee soldier from all others.

The men of this regiment entered Goldsborough with shoes worn out and in many cases barefooted, and clad in rags and tatters that hardly concealed their nakedness, yet their muskets were bright and in order, their step as firm and their bearing as soldierly as ever, and neither hard work and long marches in this, more than hard fighting in other campaigns, have been able to quench in their bosoms the indomitable spirit of the American Volunteer. On the contrary, as all their labors and privations had conduced to success, their very hardships have served to augment, if that were possible, their confidence in the great captain who leads the Army, their faith in the sacredness of the cause for which we contend, and their belief in its speedy triumph and the utter suppression of this accursed rebellion.

A complete list of casualties is annexed.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

SIR: I have the honor to submit the following report of the operations of this regiment since the movement from Goldsborough, N. C., in April last:

On the 10th day of April, 1865, at dawn of day, the regiment broke its camp near Goldsborough and took up the line of March for Raleigh, via Smithfield, having the advance of the infantry of the Twentieth Army Corps. After marching several miles the enemy was reported in force too great for the scouting party in advance to drive, and two companies and soon after the entire regiment was deployed as skirmishers. It advanced steadily, driving the enemy (consisting of several hundred mounted men of First South Carolina and Sixth North Carolina Regiments, under command of Colonel Black) easily before them and taking
