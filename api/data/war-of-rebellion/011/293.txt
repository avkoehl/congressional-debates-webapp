[Inclosure No. 3.]
HEADQUARTERS THIRD DIVISION, Huntsville, April 30, 1862.

Hon. SALMON P. CHASE,Secretary of Treasury:

SIR: Acting under orders from General Buell to encourage the trade in cotton, I have induced buyers from New York to come to the South, one of whom is W. B. Hook, my son-in-law. I think there will be sent from this region, if my course meets your approbation, from 5,000 to 10,000 bales, as rapidly as transportation can be furnished. I expect to send the cotton by train of cars to Elk River, on the Decatur road, to haul it thence to Columbia by division train, returning there regularly for supplies, to be sent by rail thence by Nashville.

I trust this will meet the approbation of the Government.

[Inclosure No. 4.]

Extract from dispatch to General Buell, May 2, 1862.

I hope thus to command this entire region of country, and to open up, as you have requested, the cotton trade.

[Inclosure No. 5.]

Extract from dispatch to Secretary of War.

MAY 7, 1862.

Cotton buyers are in the market, and I have agreed to transport their cotton by rail and wagon, charging for the Government the usual prices, using the empty supply train on its return.

I trust this will meet the approbation of the Government.

[Inclosure No. 6.]

Extract from dispatch to Secretary of War.

MAY 13, 1862.

Have sold 270 bales of cotton captured, and which is now going forward to market.
