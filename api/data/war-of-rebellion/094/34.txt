HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Nashville, December 3, 1864.

Major General A. J. SMITH,

Commanding Detachment Army of the Tennessee:

GENERAL: The front occupied by General Wood's corps is quite long and as much extended as the number of his troops will admit. The withdrawal of the Fortieth Missouri and Tenth Kansas Regiments, already in line, will leave a gap which he has not the power to fill, except by contracting his line, without causing it to become much attenuated. In consequence of this state of things, the major-general commanding directs that you occupy a portion of General Wood's line equal to the front of two regiments, as being the only method which occurs to him of remedying the difficulty.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. D. WHIPPLE,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff.
HDQRS. CAVALRY CORPS, MIS. DIV., OF THE MISSISSIPPI,Nashville, Tenn., December 3, 1864.

Major W. P. CHAMBLISS,

Special Inspector of Cavalry:

MAJOR: I send Captain Van Antwerp, aide-de-camp, with the orders directing the seizure of every species of property necessary to put the cavalry forces of this division into efficient condition. You will perceive that the authority is ample; use it without stint for seizure both of equipments and horses. You may send Captain Van Antwerp to hunt for arms and other property consigned to you. With the authority in his hands I think he can do good service. I leave many of the details to you, in pursuance of General Thomas' general instructions, confident that you will do all in your power to push matters to the utmost. Spare nothing which is necessary, but have everything done in an orderly manner.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. H. WILSON,

Brevet Major-General.
