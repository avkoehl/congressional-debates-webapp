Secretary of the Navy, Washington, D. C.

SIR: The schooner Adelso, of Saint John, Kimbal, master, from Wilmington, N. C., put into this port on the 12th instant, said schooner having run the blockade on the 6th. I requested Captain Bennett, of the revenue cutter Henrietta (then lying in this harbor), to put a prize crew on board. Wingate Hayes, esq., district attorney, being in this city I called upon him for instructions. He directed that no person should be allowed to come on shore or any one to go on board except the officers of the revenue, and also directed all the papers found on board to be sealed up and the same to remain until further advised. There is a French gentleman, a passenger on board, who has been detained under the above instructions. Should like to be advised in the matter. Have been expecting to hear from the district attorney. I wrote the honorable Secretary of the Treasury as soon as possible; as yet have received no answer.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. W. MACY,

Collector.

Honorable GIDEON WELLES,

Secretary of the Navy, Washington, D. C.

SIR: I wrote you on the 16th in relation to the detention of the schooner Adelso, of Saint John, New Brunswick, from Wilmington, N. C., cargo, spirits turpentine and rosin. I telegraphed you on the same day for instructions in relation to the landing of a French passenger from on board said schooner, an answer to which by telegraph was received the next day, 17th, and he was allowed to land. My reason more particularly for his landing was t hat he knew from conversation with the captain of the schooner that the cargo was owned by a firm in Boston, Mass. This fact he has made oath to before a notary at the custom-house.
