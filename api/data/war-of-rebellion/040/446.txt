BURNT BRIDGE,

May 7, 1863.

Brigadier-General ROBERTS:

I have information which seems reliable that the rebels are advancing from Weston of Parkersburg by three roads - Colonel [A. W.] Harman, who was here yesterday, with cavalry on the right; Imboden, with infantry and artillery, in the center, on the Parkersburg pike; and Jones, with cavalry, on the left. Can our whole force not advance on Weston?

LATHAM,

Colonel, Commanding.

WEST UNION,

May 7, 1863.

Brigadier-General ROBERTS:

My dispatch that Parkersburg is threatened is fully confirmed. I have no communication now with Parkersburg, but think the companies scattered along the road should be immediately called to that place. They cannot protect the road, and will be captured. The rebels are concentrating about Harrisville.

LATHAM,

Colonel, Commanding.

WEST UNION,

May 7, 1863.

Brigadier-General ROBERTS:

I think the enemy has withdrawn from my front. I suspect he will make a descent on the road west of me.

GEO. R. LATHAM,

Colonel, Commanding.

WHEELING,

May 7, 1863.

General ROBERTS:

From the exposed condition of this place an section, it is all-important for me to know whether you are going to move on the rebel army at Weston, or any other place, at any early period. Please answer.

F. H. PEIRPOINT,

[Governor of Virginia.]

BALTIMORE, MD.,

May 7, 1863.

Colonel J. C. KELTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Brigadier-General Scammon telegraphs me that he sent Colonel J. C. Paxton, of Second Virginia Volunteer Cavalry, to Lewisburg, to attack the enemy and create a diversion. He got drunk, and failed, and General Scammon asks his immediate dismissal* In this request I urgently concur.

ROBT. C. SCHENCK,

Major-General.
