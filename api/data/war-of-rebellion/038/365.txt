Lieutenant General J. C. PEMBERTON:

My last note was returned by the bearer. Two hundred thousand caps have been sent. It will be continued as they arrive. Bragg is sending a DIVISION; ; when it comes I will move to you. Which do you think the best route? How and where is the enemy encamped? What is your force?

J. E. Johnston,

Should find it necessary to have other horses than those you take with you, authority is given you to impress as many horses as you may require.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

HELENA, ARK., May 30, 1863.

Major General U. S. GRANT:

Commanding Department of the Tennessee:

GENERAL: From information received, I am led to believe that you have in your [department] a surplus of artillery. In view of this post has become very much reduced, and for the further reason that we are continually threatened with attack I would respectfully request that at an early moment you send me four 6-pounders and two 12-pounder howitzers. I deem this, general, important, if it is possible for you to spare them.

I have the honor to be, yours, very respectfully,

B. M. PRENTISS.
