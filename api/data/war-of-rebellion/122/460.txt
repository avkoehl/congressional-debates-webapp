WAR DEPARTMENT,

August 27, 1861.

His Excellency WILLIAM SPRAGUE,

Governor of Rhode Island:

DEAR SIR: I acknowledge receipt of your comprehensive letter of the 23rd instant. I regret than in the general orders and messages sent to you there has arisen any misapprehension on your part as to the wish of this Department. Whilst it sightly desirable that all troops regularly organized should be reported at once to Washington under the general orders published August 19, there can be no objection to making a deviation from the general rule in particular cases. under the circumstances presented in your letter I am disposed to leave the matter of organizing an moving your regiments of Rhode Island Volunteers to your own judgment. If Coil. Justus Ingersoll McCarty has been regularly sworn into the service of the United States he can muster the men, but they must be sworn into the service either by a civil magistrate or a U. S. Army officer. In regard to the Burnside Rifle Company, the Department is disposed to consider their proposal with favor.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

SIMON CAMERON,

Secretary of War.

N. B.- I have refereed your matter relative to the two batteries of artillery to the Chief of Ordnance.

AUGUSTA, ME., August 27, 1861.

Honorable S. CAMERON,

Secretary of War:

Doubtful if First regiment re-enlist for three years. Do you want it for the balance of two? If so, will its pay go on from expiration of the three-moths' service?

I. WASHBURN, JR.,

Governor.

I. WASHBURN, JR.,

Governor of Maine, Augusta:

There is no authority for this Department to continue pay from expiration of three-months' service. I earnestly hope that these troops may re-enlist for three years.

SIMON CAMERON,

Secretary of War.
