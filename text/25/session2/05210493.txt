of the patronage of Congress reterred to the Committee on
Commerce
Mr NORVFIL called the atten'ion of the Senate to the bill,
which he had introduced two oi thiee weeks ago, making cer
t&m grants of public lands, and for other purposes He had
endeavored to obtain m opportunity ol calling for its second
reading and consHcrttion, with a view to its reference to an
appropriate committee it had also been his intention to pre
sent 10 the Senate an exposition ot the objects of the bill, and
of the views andpunuples which had ledtoitsintiortuction but
the pressing business of the Senate had daily pievented the
execution of his purpose, and now the present session was too
near lbs close to authorize a hope that the action of the body
could tie had upon it until the n^xt session He should then
press its consideration, as he believed the biTl to be one of the
most important and beneficial to the whole Union that could
have been brought np Its first in eat object w is to giant to the
othei new States the same quantity of pubiic land whieh had
been gianted to Ohio for purposes of internal improvement
This was but fair, just, and qui' The next object wai to
grant to the old States as much land, according to their aggre
gate geographical suiface oi numbei oí square miles as the
new States had leceived, fu common *chools and academies,
and to give to each of hem, without ieference to their size or
population, two townships oí land for the support of umversi
ties and colleges The next piovi*ion of the bid authorized
the Estates of Mississippi anl Alabama to apply to the con
struction of road" and canals, within then limits the two per
cent fund which had been reserved for making rotda leading to
those States The í >uilh provision was to surrender to \ir
ffiijia the United States stock in the Dismal Swamp Canal to
Kentucky our subscription in thrt I omsville and Portland Ca
nal, to Maryland our subscription m the Chesapeake and Ohio
Canal, and to the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal Company
ftui subscription to stock m that canal The conditions of these
transfers weie,thatMaiyiand should pledge her faith to complete
the Chesapeake and O u > Canal to the river Ohio, and that
United State*piopertj and troops should forever pass free of
chargea)ong the whole of these canals JIi* desne was to dis
solve ihe connection of this Government with al! subscriptions
of money to improvement  withm the Stales, and to let the
States construct their own mads and cana's The bill was
free fro n sectional inequah y It extended the grants of pub
lie land to all the St Ue* foi different purpo es, to as neai ly an
equal extent as possible It was free fiom the cons ltu onal
objections urged by the late Piesident to the distribution bill
He hud carefully examined those objectio is and had avoi led
running counter to them m framing tht> bill The imyi >ve
méntof the new States by roads and cana1* and the e~ enp on
of the means of the old State* for educating their people wert
he considered, objects of vast and benefit ial magnitude and
would exert a happy influence over the whole Union, in all
time to come Far more glonous w lulditbc to Congressional
legislation to effect these great objects, without exacting a cent
jn the shape of taxation fi om the people, than it was to the
mastei of the Roman Empire, wno, to establish an eternal
msnumentofthegloriesofhisreign, erected its eastern eapi
tol a the expense ol the laboi, the money, and all that then re
mamed of the genius of obedient millions of Ins subjects Pre
s"ent and ftiture generations would btess a measure such as he
considered this bill, íeplete with lasting benefit to every part of
this growing Confederacy of free Republics
Mr N then moved to postpone the further considei ation of
the bill u .til the fiist Monday m December next, on the ground
of its being too late to have any definite aetion at the present
session
This motion was agreed to
The following bills weie severally lead the third time and
pnssed
Thebillmakmg an apipi opriation for a compilation of the

On motion oí Mr TRO 11LR, the bill to authorize the State
of Mis ls^ippi to invest the two pei cent fund belonging to that
Sute was taken up
Mi WEBSTER moved to strike out "fifty cents," and insert
' the minimum price but subsequently modified it to amotion
to strike out the m r't ofmvestmert
Mi TROT FER s ud, In reply to the remarks of the honora
ble benatoi fiom Massachusetts, 1 wilt observe, Mi President,
•hat the bill befene thp Senate pioposes toielmqmsh to Missis
sippi the amount of the two j ei cent fund which has accrued
fiom the sale of Ihe public lands in that State, and to authorize
her legislatme i > invest ltin such railroads in the State as they
may think pioper This proposition is in stnrt conformity to
the practice which hat. recently been adopted by Congiess A
bill lias passed the Senate during the present session, to permit
the State of Alab imi to appiopnate the two pei cent fund
which has acciued from the sales of her public landsin the con
struction of a gieat lailmad in that State, and the same privt
lege has been extended to Arkansas, Michigan, and Louisiana
By the teimsof the compact of 1817 between the United States
and the Sute of Mississippi, five pei cent of the pioceedsofthe
b ties ol the public lands m the State wasreseived, thiee per
cent of which was to be appropuated by the State to objects of
internal niipiovernent within hei limits, and the remaining two
pei cent by Congrtss to the making of a road leading to the
State We believe that the reasons which then existed for
making this designation of the purposes to which the two j ei
cent should be applied have long since ceased, and that the con
trol oí it by ( mgros should ceise also The j nncfple of the
bill itwilHhu*re pei uved is to lelmquish tin* fund to the
s att and to | lace it under hei c >ntrol limiting us ipplic ition
to load* and rulr ud* Upon this generil proportion there can
m=;e is I conceive no contiovei*y because the pin ciple of it
bib been ihcady frtquently acquiesced in and fully tstablisho 1
Ihe bill however makesa fmtherpiovisionthattheamountof
this fund now on haa 1, as well as thit which may hereafter ac
ci ue may be ime*led m lands, subtect to prn ate sale or entry
at fifty cents an acre This is asked with the view to increase
the means ihus placed at the disposal ol the State, to effect those
great purposes of interna! impiovement which it is the sole do
sign of the measure to accomplish, and which are so loudly de
manded by the (ondition ol the State, and as this is, perhaps,
the first timeCongre*s has been called upon to act opon such a
pioposition, I will proceed to suite as concisely as I can < onsis
tently with the nature of the subject, the grounds upon which
we urge its adopn n The five percent fund reserved under
the teims of the compact of 1817, was evidently intended to be
a consideration for the relinquishment which the State was
com pel ¡ed to make of her claim to the waste and unappropriated
lands widim hei limits, an 1 of her rightto tax the same wiihm
fb e years after thetr sale bv the United States I say the State
was computed to adopt the ordinance by which tins rclm
quisl mem was made, because it was made a condition of
her admission into the Union, and an indispensable one and
thatjitshoul 1 likewise be irrevocable withouttheconsentoi Con
gresrf It must, then, be confessed that the reservation of die
fivey r cent was a very paltry and inadequate consider ttitn
fir the immense sacrifice not only of her pecuniary interest,
but of her sovereign poweis of legislation which the State was
thus foi ced to make The amount of the sales of her lands,
reaching alreadv t! e enormous sum of near $13 000 000, afford
abundant pr>of of this, if proof were wanting This compact
has, however, nevt-rbeen disturbed, and I am sine I do notde
sign to do «¡oat this time The Government itself appeals to
have become sensible of the hardships and injustice which the
seveial new States suffered by the opeiation of this and similar
ordinances, aodhaeaheady taken steps to lessen the severity
of them by restoring to these States the taxing power so un
pjstly wi hheld and by permitting the States of Arkansas and
Michigan to enter the Union, without this restriction upon their
constitutional rights There is not perhaps m the whole his
tory of the operations of the Federal Government, a more oh
noxious and arbitrirv exercise ol power, than that winch ex
acted the sur enderof winch I am speaking A surrender whirh
nece^san'y carried with it the highest and most essential aun
bu te of Tveieisnty and pmsd etion A surrender which m
puncipc ibandone 1 th" freedom an 1 independence of thu
Statf s and the exeici^e of a most important n tegral portion
of their municipal powers "Ves, fir, itabr^ged then nehts
tripplel their i esonT.es and laid them undci a de^radm* ton
nbiitmn to the Federa! Govtrnnrrit Its tendency was not
only to cramp and parahse their energies but to place them in
a mi st humiliating contrast with their sister State? Under the
provi ions of the Con*ti ution the> were enti led to admis
*.i n mto the Union, upon iie same terms with the original
States and Congress had no power to abate one ]ot or Utile of
then inherentsover igntv freedom and independence But i
will not pursue this subject further than to remark that what
e\ei may bp the issue of the question which respects the light
oí tiie states to the dominion of the land* within their chartered
lrntp there can vet be no doubt as to th^ injustice and file
gahty of ihe prohibition to tax them, after they have been
sold and become a part of the mass of private property If
this prohibitum could be n-htfully extended file v^ars after
the lands are sold why not fifty on thousand or ad infinitum?
But no one will ms^t that a nermanent restuction of this sort
would betoleiatej fn a moniui bv any State that deseiv°« to
be tanked as'■uch amorist the members of mrsrlonous Con
ftderacy The United Slates posses*ed j ust the same power to
inhibit the exercise of the taxing power of the States ovei any
othei, species of private property within their limits Yet no
one will pretend: I imagine, that if this restriction had gone to
this extent, that it would not have been an effectual prostration
of then sovereignty and political iruegmy, nay, thatH woufei
not have been fatal to their very existence But where is ihe
difference in principle between the two cases? Between tno
right totaxpuvate Ian 1 and slaves, money, or merchandise?
Sir, the Government had no power to make such a compact
with a State of this Union The State which I have the honor
m part to repiesent on this floor, has muth cause to complain
«fthe operation of this restriction, not only for the reasons^!
íeady suggested, but because it has been the means of curtail-
ing her lawful lesouroea To what extent her revenue has
been diminished by its operation, it is impossible at this time to
determine with accuracy (That the amount has been very con-
sidetable, there is, however, no doubt, and Will be found, I
daie say, quite equal to if it does not exceed, tho extent of the
privileges sought by this bill Ye , sir, I have but little doubt,
that if all we ask is conceded, we shall not receive more than
upon just principles of íestitution, we aieentitled to Restore
us to out rights, which have been withheld, violated, outraged,
by the hard and ciuel policy of the Government This is what
we ask
But theie arc other grounds, far less debatable, upod which
t rest the success of this bill, and ust i twith entire confidence
It is upon the broad principle of equal justice You are asked
Jo do foi Mississippi what you have done for the other new
States, for Alabama, Indiana, Illinois, and Ohio We do not
ask you to do this, howe\er, by a direct grant of the public
lands to the extent of those which have been made to these
States, hut by a simple reduction of the price to nTty certs an
acie, so that we may be pei muted to pmchase at that price to
the extent of the fund which has acciued or may hereafter
acci ue to us It is tiue we may be mistaken when we sup
pose, as we do, that in thi* way we shall be put upon terms
ot something like equably with the enumerated States Font
may turn out that m payme fifty cents an acie for thece lande,
(being only allowed to purchase such as are subject to private
entry,) we ma> give for them as much as they are worth, and
in that event we gain nothing by the bill We are willing,
however, to take it in this way leaving its confirmation to the
Legtslatuieof the State And it lemuns foi me to show, that
by the moot favoiable calculation of result41, we will barely
leceive our j ust proportion of the public land"
It will be recollected by the Senate that the United States
have gianted to the Slate oi Alabama 400,000 acres of the public
lande foi purposes of internal improvement, to Indiana 434,000,
to Illinois 4SO,000, and to Ohio 1,050,001), for similar purposes;
whilst not one acre has ever bet n gianted to the State of Mis
sisHippi an 1 yet *he has already paid into the National Trea-
surv ne nly %\'i 00ft 001) the proteed* of tho sale of her lands
It is inteiestmg md msnuctivc lu examine the ofh&al tables of
the aniégate *iles oi the pubiu lands m the sfcveial new
¡state", and ticontiabt them with the tables, also official, of the
giant* made to the same
In Ohio, the salts up to the 30th Sept last are      Q?l 777,692 95
Indiana                                                                17,5W 430 39
Illinois                                                            «   11,010024 72
Alabama                                                              10,4(96,849 08

Thus we diocovei that Mississippi ha-s paid to the United
States neirly a million of dollars more than Illinois, and only
a few millions less than the othei States included m the enu
meration, whilst in the table of grants, and fa vol s and dona
tions she stands exactly m the proportion of 000000 acres to
400 000 to Alabama, 434,000 to Indiana ISO 000 to Illinois and
I O'ÍOjOOO to Ohio la this ¡upt—is it consonant with those pun
eiples of equality which lie at the found it ion of our Repubh
can institutions ? I am suie there can be but one answer to
thisque«t'on Hut I do not complain of the Government for
tins, foi I am not apprised that whil&t this distribution of pnvi
leges was in pioeress, Mississippi I rough! forward her claim
to any poition of" the public lands foi similai purposes It
remain* to be seen whethirshe will havejustcause to tax the
partiality and injustice of Congress, on this ubject
||1 now propose to show that the adoption of this bill will
baiely, under the most lavorable anticipation of íesults, bring
the folate of Mississippi up by the si le of the other States
The amount of the two pei cent fund which has alreadv ac
crued from the sale of the lands in Mississippi, is &274 518 If
this sum shall be inve«ted in land, at fiftv cents an acre, as
proposed by the bill it will purchase 54&030 acres This
will exceed the quantity granted to Alabama 149 036 aciee, that
to Indiana 11 o 03b to Illinois 69 03b, and will fall short of that
¿i anted to Ohio 301000 From this estimate however, it is
necessary to deduct the value of the purtha*e money, which is
the pioperty ol the State 1 he sum of $274 518, which the
State will pay for the quantity of land above mentioned, will,

vernment, of the whole 75 000 000 acies which have teen dis-
posed of md which is SI 26£ an acie purchase about
217 000aciesof!and In order, therefore to adjust the balances
fairl> between Mississippi and the other States it is proper to
deduct iht217000acre*, the value of the fundón hand from
tin, 549 03G acre*, anl, wh n this is done it will be peiteived
that Mis*i *ippi will receive upon the principles of a grant,
and upon the teims of the donation11 to the othei States, only the
quantity of "V 036 acres This will be le^s than Alabama has
re<eivedby6 961 acres than Indiana hy 82036, than Illinois
by 147 03j and ihan Ohio b> 718,000' So far, sir, tho calcula
tionisb ««d upon official data None can mistake them w
ihe results whieh fiow fiom them The Senate will perceive
that we are yet greatly behind the cthei States, and the bill
pioposes to obuate this inequality by anticipating the future
sales m Mississippi It pioposes to invest the-mount which
shall hereafter accrue in the same manner and upon the sama
terms with that which has already accrued The difficulty
wmeh anses here ism ascei taming what the amount of the
futuie sales will be  and m the pursuit of Jus inqaiiy al! our
estimates must be conjectural, of course____
There have been sold m th<> State 9 J3.>9k> aciesof land, for
the aggregate sum as I before remarkel ot $19 538,608 13
There yet remain unsold and und sr wed of, U 274,474 acres,
in which is included, howe\er the quan.ity subject to resident
Choctaw locations, and it will also ! e recol'ccted by the Senate

the Augusta land district alone nearly seven millions of aure«,
and in the adjoining Washington dis r tt upward** of two mil
hors moref making *hc entne quanti y n these tw > di tricts of
