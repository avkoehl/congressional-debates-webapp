Major-General CLEBURNE,

Jackson says there are four guns on the left reporting to you, two 3-inch at Armstrong's wagon train. Please send order to lieutenant Young at Ross' wagon train near East Point to proceed at once to Jonesborough with two steel guns and one caisson.

Brigadier-General JACKSON,

Jonesborough, Ga.:

Do you think you have broken the enemy sufficiently to spare a regiment for our left? The cavalry serving with the several corps probably annoy us. What has become of the raiders?

General.]

Brigadier-General JACKSON,

Jonesborough:

A report has just been received that a raid is moving on Opelika-is probably the brigade heretofore on Sweet Water. Also a scout reports that the cavalry on our right left yesterday, saying that they were going after Wheeler. The general thinks the force you are after is the only one you have to fear.
