The land office emoluments had all be^ti hmittd in
the new States,  the custo n house, ma^hal", and
others should be limited m the old States
Mr. B. said the present was a '■va table occasion
to fulfil a promise which he hai' ra *dt, a few da} s
ago, in replying to some very di'inteiestcd and pa-
triotic sentiments delivered by the Senator from
South Carolina, on the opposite side of the cham-
ber [Mr Preston ] That Senator had then deli-
vered very excellent sen imenls in relation to re-
movals from office—had denou iced Ihe spoils
doctrine—had declared that proscription was it elf
to be proscribed—that henceforth there were to be
no removals tor t pinion's sake—no faithful officer
turned out to make room (or a political fnend—no
changes except foi mi conduct—and 'hat the new
Administration, in all this, would the reverse i f
the present and tlie la«t pa sed. I took occasion
upon toe mutant, (saii Mr B ) to correct that Se-
nator, so far as the Slate of Missouti was con-
cerned, an I to let him know that proscription for
opinion'  sake had never bien practi ed by the
pwsed or present Administration id thai Sale—
that no removals had been made there except for
cause—that many political oppon«nts had been re-
appointed to the offices which th y bad fillet'—thdt
trie spuls doc rme had never been piacii'W upon
there—that this was known to every body in Mis-
soun, ai d should beknonn io every bedy hen,
and that he would take a suitable occasion to veufy
this statement by a iiiereiceto established faUs
That occasion has now arrived, and I proceed to
the fulfilment or my promise

Mr. John Dougherty, In lian agent on the Mi -

tucky, appointed by Mr Adam-, iboiooghiy in
opposition, and complaint made against him for
improper interfererce ¡n an election, •> d was on
the point of being dismiss d by the Secretary at
War, (Mr. Eaton) when, at any mstanc, th'* or-
der was suspended until the complaint could be
examined, and was ascertained to be unfounded
He served until 1834, when he was legislated out
oi t ffi e at the leorgam/U on of the agencies He
was i* eu le appointed by President Jat ks m, served
out the 'eim ot f ur jeirs, wis then re-appointed
by P^su'ei.t Van Buren, and res'gned in 1839
lie is now a member of the General Assembly of
Missouri, and is as decidedly opposed to our party
as any man in the State
Majoi Taliaferro, Indian agent on ths Upper
Mississippi, salary $1,300 per annum. Net only
was he not removed, but when legisla'ed out of
office in 1834, with other agents, he was re ap-
po nied by Sene ral Jackson, at an increase J! sala
ry served his term of four years, was re-appoint-
el by Mr Van Buren, and htlJ the place till he
chose to resign He was entirely opposed to us in
pili'ics
Mr P L Chouteau, he was appointed agent to
tne 0 a >es by General Jacison, fhoush of opposi-
tion poli'cs, remain  d m ofrre till 1834, when, at
the leorjamzation of the agencie , his place was
reduced o a sub-age icy, and he declined *o hold it
any longer
Mr J V Hamiltor, he was oppotnted succes-
s>r to Major Dougherty in lb30, in the íeces, of
Congress, an! without the knowledge of the M s-

These, mi, are the principal appointments of the
Indian Department m Missoun, and from this
statement it is seen that, <-o far from being
proscribed for opinion's sake, the Opposition
nearly monopolized the Indian offices during ihe
administrations of General Jackson and Mr Van
Burea.

impeach his conduct, public or private, or attribute

has been a consistent Democrat forty j ears, a quiet,
courteous, inoffensive man, of whom every one
will speak well, except those who want his office.v
Thus, sir, stands ihe account of proscription ia/
M^sonri, many of the Kst offices in the State be-
ing tn the hands of the Opposition during their own
pleasure, or until the expiration oí their terins, and
'ome of them ten and e'even years out of twelve.
Certainly there were some removals, but they were
fe v m nuaibT, tell nearly equally upon both par-
ties, and were always for cause 0/ three land
ofheeri removed, two were on our own side, of two
marshals removed, one was on our own side, of
two district attorneys either remo fed or not re-
appo'ntcd, H was one and on of each political party.
In no cose that I knew of, was there an instance of
re noval for the purpose of making room for a pe-
liticil tnend, but lor the purpose of getting rid of
an improper officer Pi r myself, my uniform an-
swer to all tho^e who applied to have others re-
moved, was that they mult thovi m'sconducl When
that was not done, I refused to recommend the re-
moval, and this u known to the whole State of
Missoun
Mr B said he could give other instances of po-
litical opponents retained in office in Missouri, but
he had mentioned enough to comply with his pro-
mise, and to show, by facs, that proscription for
opinion's sake had never been practised in that
State—that it vas a prac ice unknown there—and
must originate with the new Administration, if ltgets
there at all During the twelve j ears which the De-
mocracy have borne sway, no appointments, or re-
movals, hare been made in Missoun, except for the
public service, and he was proud to be able to say that
they had bee i good appointments, and had pro-
moted the public service He looked with p'ide
and  aii taction upon the conduct of the public of-
fice r« in thai State for twelve years post It was
an example 'o the whole Unu n Great Was the

of money there, va=t sums had been transferred
from that point to New York, it was probable that
twenty or thirty millions had been collected and
dis rihute I from ihat point m the last twelve years;
and no hmg had been lost to the Government. He
beiie/ed tin re were no losses m all ih it time. All
was well there, and if ihe new Administration
practi es on tbe professions, which the Senator from

Mr B «aid Ihat he kit hi i,self a'liberty to speak

And he amendment to the same clause, limiting
the temuneration, by fees, of district attorneys,
