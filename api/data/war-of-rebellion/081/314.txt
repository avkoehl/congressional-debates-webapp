HEADQUARTERS SIXTH CORPS,June 22, 1864-1.30 p.m.

Major-General MEADE:

On leaving you I advanced my picket-line several hundred yards preparatory to a forward movement, when it was attacked by a strong skirmish line of the enemy, which had evidently been advancing at the same time, as a little while before officers had been out beyond the point where the firing took place, the firing extending along all of Ricketts' and part of Russell's front. I have ordered the skirmish line to push forward, to be followed up by the main force. The woods are thick and nothing can be seen of the enemy's position.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS SIXTH CORPS,June 22, 1864-2.30 p.m.

Major-General MEADE:

GENERAL: The skirmish fire is chiefly in General Ricketts' front; we have forced them back somewhat. General Wright, being of the opinion that the enemy's line is not perhaps very long, has ordered General Russell to put in a force to flank their line or make a hole in it.

Respectfully,

THEO. LYMAN,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Volunteer Aide-de-Camp.
HEADQUARTERS SIXTH ARMY CORPS,June 22, 1864-2.55 p.m.

Major-General MEADE:

Since my last dispatch I have advanced the picket-line in front of General Ricketts' perhaps 100 yards, but can get it no farther by direct attack without bringing up a line of battle. I have, however, instructed General Russell, whose front has come in contact with the enemy only on his left, to put in a force to take the enemy's line in flank, and have ordered the skirmish line to move forward at the same time. If my supposition that this force is only local in extent [is true] I have no doubt the enemy will be driven back. On my left is a swamp, which the pickets represent as impassable. Do you wish me to attack in force? My line is somewhat over a mile beyond the Jerusalem plank road, on the Williams house road.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS SIXTH CORPS,June 22, 1864-3.15 p.m.

Major-General MEADE:

The enemy, represented so far as a brigade, in two lines of battle, with skirmishers out, has driven our party from the railroad and is slowly pressing them toward our left flank. General Wright thinks of swinging back part of Ricketts' to assist General Wheaton in holding the flank. Orders have been sent to the cavalry to again advance and attack anything but a line of battle.

THEODORE LYMAN.
