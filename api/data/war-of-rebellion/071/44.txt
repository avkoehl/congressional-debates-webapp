NORTH BRANCH, July 4, 1864-4 p. m.

Brigadier General B. F. KELLEY,

Cumberland, Md.:

GENERAL: Captain Harrison informs me that the wires are being tampered with between this and Cumberland. The enemy are at Patterson's Creek, but I cannot tell in what force. I will wait their coming. I have sent a communication to Colonel Thompson but have no answer. I think the enemy are between him and this force. There is some skirmishing at the advanced pickets. I fell the want of a few cavalry very much as I do not wish to reduce the strength of the infantry be sending small parties out.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. PEASE,

Captain, &amp;c.

Examine the road at the Narrows below you toward Old Town and see if it cannot be blockaded by felling timber into it after Colonel Thompson comes up. Answer as soon as you ascertain.
