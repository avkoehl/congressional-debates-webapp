organization of national militia.
The SPEAKER announced as the first busi-
ness in order during the morning hour reports
of committees, beginning with the Committee
on the Militia.
Mr. PAINE. From the Committee on the
Militia, I report back, with amendments, the
bill (H. R. No. 1145) to provide for organiz-
ing, arming, and disciplining the militia, and
for other purposes.
Mr. Speaker, before the House proceeds to
the consideration of this bill I will state, for
the gratification of my friends who have busi-
ness following the morning hour, that I shall
make no speech upon the bill. I have spent
much time in thinking about it, and I am un-
willing to spend any more time in talking
about it. I wish, however, to state the course
which I should be glad to have pursued by the
House in the consideration of this measure.
It has been arranged between my colleague on
the committee, the gentleman from Missouri,
[Mr. Noell,] and myself that the time occu-
pied in the consideration of the bill shall be
equally divided between the opponents and
supporters of the bill.
After the bill is read I will ask the Clerk to
read a brief statement of facts. Then I will
yield what is left of the morning hour equally
to the advocates and opponents of the bill,
resuming the floor, however, ten minutes be-
fore the expiration of the morning hour for the
purpose of demanding the previous question.
If the previous question shall be seconded, I
will then, to-day or to-morrow, in the morning
hour, give as much time as may be required by
the advocates and opponents of the bill, and
will then ask for a vote. I will also yield the
floor, not only for the purpose of opposing and
supporting the bill, but for the purpose of
moving amendments by those who are opposed
to the bill as well as those who are in favor of
it. To that end I ask unanimous consent that
amendments desired to be submitted may be
considered as pending, to be voted on in their
order, notwithstanding the seconding of the
previous question.
There was no objection to the last propo-
sition, and it was ordered accordingly.
Mr. PAINE. I am glad of that, for other-
wise I could not have allowed all the amend-
ments to come in, if the previous question
should have to be called, for want of time.
The SPEAKER. If this bill be not voted
on to-day in the morning hour, it will go over
till next Tuesday. It will take about forty
minutes to read it.
Mr. PAINE. If there be no objection, the
first reading of the bill can be dispensed with.
The bill will not go over until next Tuesday,
for I purpose to call the previous question
before the morning hour expires.
Mr. ROSS. It is near the close of the ses-
sion, and I think we had better move that the
bill be laid on the table.
The SPEAKER. The gentleman from Wis-
consin has the floor.
Mr. LE BLOND. I call for the reading of
the entire bill.
The Clerk then read the bill, as follows :

atives of the United States of America in Congress as-
