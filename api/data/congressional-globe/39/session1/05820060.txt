APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
[January 31,

session of by the gentleman from Massachusetts,
[Mr. Banks,] and placed where their "bills of
safety" and their ''resolutions of sympathy"
and their "protests" against arbitrary arrests
could do the country no harm—is it for such as
they to again influence the destinies of my State?
Let others act as they may, for one I shall never
consent that such men shall be enfranchised \ill
the foundations of this Government have been
so firmly established as that no man once tainted
■with treason can ever exert any influence in
unsettling it.
But, sir, the most mortifying thing to me, as
a Union man and a Marylander, is the fact that
Erominent men in my State—men who once held
igh positions in the Union ranks, and who have
been honored by the loyal masses with their con-
fidence—are found leagued with these rebels and
rebel sympathize!® in obtaining a repeal of the
clause in our constitution disfranchising them
on account of their disloyalty. To say that the
Union people of Maryland hold in utter abhor-
rence such men is not to express half of the in-
dignation that is felt at the unholy alliance they
have made; and I venture to assert that these
disfranchised rebels, who are now using them
as their pliant tools, will, so soon as their work
has been finished, cast them adrift as no longer
worthy to associate with "southern chivalry."
Prominent among these'' constitutional reform-
ers " is one who, failing to become the leader of
the Union element, has sought for prominence
among those who hate him as cordially as they
love, or rather feign to admire, his treason to
his party. They are dupes enough to believe
that that gentleman can make their "calling
and election sure." In a speech which he lately
made to the "anti-registration convention" he
thus discourses:
"The Picsidcnt of the United States has said that
wo must trust tho people with their Government.
[Applause.] That is the principle I go upon. And
when we have got to the period when wo cannot trust
the peoplo with their Government, there is an end of
the nature ofgovernmeut. Audheappliesthatto the
southern States where tho rebellion has been exist-
ing, and where all men, whether they concurred in
the original policy of secession or were drawn into it
by their sympathies with their brethren, liavo been
or still are arrayed against the Government, Hcsays
to his fellow-citizens, 'Youmusttrustthosc men with
the management of their local governments and give
them their share in the affairs of theGeneral Govern-
ment.' Afortiori, if this can be said of the southern
rebellious States, it can be said of tho State of Mary-
land. And yet, here in Maryland, by the process
taken here, more than one half of her stalwart popu-
lation are denied a share in the Government of the
country. Everybody agrees that our troubles are over
—General Grant, General Sherman, Governor An-
drew, in a lato message to the members of the Gen-
eral Assombly of Massachusetts. And let me tell you
here that I have great respect for Governor Andrew.
He is one of the sincere men of the country. Hcsays
that everybody in the South has upheld the senti-
ments of secession, hut that it is a thing of the past.
That is the sentiment of tho men who have mingled
in the war and thedisinterestedmenwhohavelooked
on from a distance. Why, then, are our people here
and there to be disfranchised? It is for the object of
possessing political power [loud a.pplause and hissing]
in defiance of the political principle which undci i es
our wholo form of Government: that tho minority
may rule the majority. And they have ulterior ob-
jects in view to perpetuate that rule. They do not
anticipate that they can keep forever one half of the
whole country, or one third of you, my fellow-citi-
zens, from sharing all power in the Government; but
they anticipate keeping it so long until they can lorce
into the elements of political power tho black race.
[Long-continued applause, and cries of ' That's the
ideal']
"That is, to bnild power oyer you and over our fif-
teen southern^ States, until it is absolute that such
elements arc introduced into the future history of
the country, to be managed by the Froedmen's Bu-
reau, and absolutely controlling the balance of pow-
er of the whole of these fifteen States in which that
institution has existed. You see that it is a very
large scheme, conceived with very greatskili, and by
very adroit and ambitious men. A little while ago,
having this conception of the matter, I felt it my duty
to separate myself, in my political action, from the
organized forces with whom I had been voting dur-
ing the war, and to go to that party and help and
aid it in bringing the country together—the Demo-
cratic party, [enthusiastic cheering;] the Democratic
party, which it is charged by the opponents is to be
restored to power if these southern States are to have
their rights of franchise. If they had nohigher mo-
tive for exerting themselves in behalf of the south-
ern States, I go with them without regard to their
motive, because that is our objcct, and I want to see
it secured. The other side, acting upon the same
party interests, seek to keep those States out, because
they apprehend tliey will be/voted down. That made
a great hurrah among my friends of the Union party
in Maryland, that I should presume toliaveanopin-
ion of my own, and to act upon it in regard to the
existing circumstances. Some of the gentlemen with
whom I had been associated, some of whom I had
been instrumental in electing to Congress, reproached
me with having left them and gone to the side of
the Democratic party in New York. Well, what have
they been doing? They have been voting with the
Democrats in the House of Representatives. They
have found, what I told them before, that this radi-
cal party, which predominates, and under the disci-
pline of old Thad. Stevens, who drives them where
he wills, has got the negro as the predominating ele-
ment to the control of power. Mr. Phelps, and John
L. Thomas, jr., and others, who represent the con-
stituencies of Baltimore, have to vote with the Dem-
ocrats all the time."
Now, sir, in so far as these remarks are
applicable to myself, I can only say that this
gentleman is the last man on earth that I am
indebted to for the position I occupy in this
House. On the contrary, it has been asserted
that he was the friend of another gentjem an who
failed to getthenomination of my party. Neither
am Iaware of having " reproached himforgoing
over to the side of the Democratic party." I
never considered that his going over to the
Democracy was of any moment, and I do not
think his defection will carry along with it any
consequences detrimental to the Union party.
As to my voting with the '1 Democrats all the
time," it is not "according to tho record." I
have never voted for a Democrat in my, life,
and since I have had the honor to be a mem-
ber of this body I have found my name, recorded
on the same side that they supported but once,
and that was on the District suffrage bill. Had
1 the right to vote to morrow, I would vote the
same way and for the same reasons.
Sir, these men who left the State to engage in
armed rebellion will find that the Union men
of Maryland are not inclined to sell their hard-
earned heritage for a mess of pottage. They
will discover that there is loyalty enough in the
State to prevent its surrender to its enemies,
and that he whom they have chosen as their
leader will be as successful in deluding the
Union party to commit suicide as he was in
persuading the people of New York to support
John Van Buren & Co.
I hope, Mr. Speaker, I may be pardoned for
thus alluding to the affairs of my State; but, as
the proposition of the gentleman from Ohio,
[Mr. Schexck,] basing representation oil vot-
ing population, would be unjust to the Union
people of my State, and, in my opinion, aid
directly the efforts now being made to enfran-
chise the rebellious portion of it, I thought it
my duty to allude to it. and at the same time
to defend myself from the efforts made by then-
leader to place me where I do not now, never
have, and never expect to belong.
I have said, Mr. Speaker, that population
was the most certain way of apportioning rep-
resentation. I do not see how we can agree
on any other plan. To base representation on
wealth, or tho amount of taxable property in a
State, is not right in its theory or just in its prac-
tical workings. It would give large representa-
tion for wealthy cities, and do an injustice to
agricultural districts; and the only feasible plan
that has been proposed is the one reported from
the committee on reconstruction.
This resolution has been supposed by some
to be intended to force negro suffrage on the
southern States. If I thought that this was
either its intention or would be its effect, I
would not support it. T am opposed to negro
suffrage at this time, in any manner and any
and everywhere, for the reasons fully stated by
me in the debate on the District of Columbia
bill. I have nothing to take from what I then
said. From the language and intention of this
proposed amendment, I am satisfied that no
southern State will grant the suffrage to the
negro. They cannot give a qualified suffrage
to the negro for the reason that they make noth-
ing in their increase of representation. They
will not give them universal suffrage, because
a majority of white men cannot be found in the
South willing to place them on the same politi-
cal level. It leaves it to be settled by each of
the States for themselves, and that without any
interference by the General Government.
The effect of this amendment will be that the
States lately in rebellion wil' lose ten Repre-
sentatives in this House.
To illustrate this point more fully, I beg leave
to add the following, from the remarks of the
gentleman from Ohio, [Mr. Lawrence,] and
which shows the gross inequalities that have
existed all along, and will continue to exist,
unless this amendment becomes a part of the
organic law:
" 'In 1790 the ratio of representation was one Rep-
resentative to every thirty-three thousand of the rep-
resentative population. Now it is one Representative
for every one hundred and twenty-seven thousand.
On the 23d of May, 1850, the principle was established,
for the first time, of limiting the number of Repre-
sentatives, and thus relieving Congress of the neces-
sity of fixing every ten years the number of members
of which the House should consist. This law estab-
lished the number of Representatives at two hundred
and thirty-three, who were to be apportioned among
the several States, respectively, by dividing the num-
ber of the representative population of the States by
the number 233, and the product of this division was
to be the ratio of representation. In the slave States
three fifths of the slaves were added to the white class
to preserve the balance of power. This law of May,
1850, was changed after the apportionment by another
law, passed on March 4,1862. This increased the num-
ber of Representatives to two hundred and forty-one,
several of the States gaining one member by the
change.'
"This representation was apportioned among the
several States having free and slave population thus:

" The free eolored population of the States in 1860
was 470,562, making a total of 31,149,905.
" From this it will be seen thatNew Hampshire, with
a white population of 325,579, has but three Repre-
sentatives, while Louisiana, with a white population
of 3o7,629, had five. California, with a white popula-
tion of 323,177, has but three Representatives, while
Mississippi, with a similar population of 353,901, had
five. In South Carolina, 72,817 white persons had one
Representative, while the ratio of representation is
one for 127,000 persons.
" Under this mode of apportionment the late slave
States had eighteen Representatives by tho census of
1860 more than their just share, if based on free popu-
lation."
So much impressed wore the Union men of
Maryland of the preponderating influence in
the slave counties of the State, that in 1864,
when they abolished slavery, we made a new
apportionment of representation, which was
based exclusively upon the white population,
just as it will hereafter be under this amend-
ment in all the late slave States. We did this
because we thought it would be unjust to allow
the slave counties to have the same represen-
tation for their negroes as freedmen as under
the old constitution they had for their slaves.
