a proportionate quantum of the iiifltence tho?e mo-

more than all, deprives it of the prospect of perpe-
tuating itself, through us intimate connection with
the Government, by involving U ,n its deso'atmg

is inberenl, it is the pure, pervading spirit or ele-
ment that conserves, that regulates, that binds to-
gether, that support a free Government, it is the
essence of liberty itself It should beso hallowed,
so cherished, so well undersood by a people that
would continue to be free, that the man who would
be willing to infringe in e,lh« by word or deed
shruld be con&idereda. traitor to tfee glorious sen-
timents that inspired, ennobl d, and sustained the
efforts of tbi patriots of the Revolution. AH Con-
stitu ims, all Uws, whether State or Federal, must
be amenable to ihis great principle, they must all
be tes ed by i<; and whatever will not stand that
test, must be dissipated, given to the winds—for,
in the human brep-,1, it u above every circum-
tance that may eonfl ct with it; it is the personi-
fication of justice and truth in man associated with
his fellow man, to guide him in. the polity of free
government
But heretofore, alas' we ha"e not been guided by
it, notwithstanding that tte admonitions of repeated
revulsions and calamities in our monetary affairs
and industriaf interests have warned us to retara
to its plain direclion I believe u was Mr Hamil-
ton whi offered thefirot insult to ih.s primary
principle of ¡ree government, and succeeded in
perpetrating the outrag". It passed with impuni-
ty; and infraction succeeded infraction from
that day henceforward, until a glimmering of
light presented lLelf in the separation of Bank

N) expediency, no pretence, no circumstance of
specula 're good, hcv>" ver specious—no general-

principle, this holy t e na ccrr n's a free people

tht world in arms Every departure in l.gislation
from this inestimable conservator of rational liber-
ty is an appro?ch towards dissolution—both of
frre government and the Union, and a perseve-
rance in such deviations from th s unerring, this
golden rule for the perpetuation of freedom and in-
dependence, mast inevitably end m the destruction
of both Nothing but a stnci adherence to it will
prevent such a catasfophe, and I hope and trust
