Mrs. W. G. BROWNLOW, Knoxville.

MADAM: By Major General E. Kirby Smith I am directed most respectfully to inform you that you and your children are not held as hostages for the good behavior of your husband as represented by him in a speech at Cincinati recently, and that yourself and family will be required to pass beyond the C. S. line on thirty-six hours from this date. Passports will be granted you from this office.

Very respectully,

W. M. CHURCHWELL,

Colonel and Provost-Marshal.

KNOXVILLE, TENN., April 21, 1862.

Colonel W. M. CHURCHWELL, Provost-Marshal.

SIR: Your official note as provost-marshal for East Tennessee ordering myself and family to remove beyond the limits of the Confederate States within the next thirty-six hours is just received and I hasten to reply to it. My husband as you are aware is not here to afford me his protection and counsel; and being well night in the evening of life with a family of dependent children I have to request as a matter of indulgence that you extend the time for my exile a few days longer as to leave within the time prescribed by your mandate would result in the total sacrifice of my private interests.

I have to request the further information what guarantee of safety your passport will afford myself and family.

Yours, &amp;c.,

ELIZA A. BROWNLOW.
