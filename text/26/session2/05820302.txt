APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE,
Feb. 1841
26th ConG""2nd Sess.
Treasury Note Bill—Mr. Mallory.
H. of Reps.
are allowed to interfere in elections, yea, required
to save their salaries by their party services, the
Treasury must suffer for it; for electioneering re-
quires funds, and officers will not take their own
money when they can reach Uncle Sam's The
dearest purchase ever made by any people is the
parchase of themselves with their own taxes which
they have paid into the public Treasury. I would
put down at every hazard the tyranny of },roscnp-
iton, the most extravagant of all tyrannies, which
is always sure to turn out of office some honest
and many knowing officers, and to put many dis
honest and ignorant ones in the* places I could
give many instances of maBy losses under the pre-
sent and last Administrations from this cause alone
Appoint the virtue and intelligence of the country to
office without regard to party services, ana you will
find thousand oí dollars gained as well as thousands
saved by that simple operation of finance Stop
the spoils system, and punish corruption, in every
shape by prompt removals from office for any abuses
or defalcation. Put aside incompetency m every case,
andiavor no fool because he happens to be your
personal or political friend These are some of
the maxims to replenish your exhausted Treasury
and to supply its apprehended deficiencies If they
are faithfully observed for twelve months to come,
my word for u, there will be no deficiences to be
supplied. Above all, give to the country 0 safe,
sound, and uniform currency, and restore confidence
between man and man ana Government and citi-
zen, and your coffers will soon be full, and Hea-
ven's and the people's blessings will rest upon jour
Administration
As to the best mode of giving to the country a
safe, sound, and uniform cuirency, my opinions
are well known to these who know any thing about
my opinions at all With Mr Madison, I believe
that a National Bank is absolutely Decenary, and
must, try whatever other experiments, you please,
be resorted to in the end I believe su< h an insti-
tution not on'y constitutional and expedient, but,
"ojo Soutliern man and a Stale tights man, I support
it as the best friend of the South, which is more m
jured by abad currency ihan any other section of
the country, and as the only means of creating a
hand of the law for the legislative department, to
keep the legislative power of the custody and the
control of the public money out of the hinds of the
Executive The Executive has assumed trut pow-
er by snatching the public money /rom the vaulu
of a National Bank I would create a National
Bank for the purpose of restoring to Congress, its
constitutional fiscal power, if for no «thei purpose
That is one of the best modes ot reducing Execu-
tive patronage. But my views on this question
were delivered at length at the extra session of
1837. Now, I will only say that* will vote for
such an institution if it be brought forward at the
right time, is it be properly organized, and be lo-
cated at the proper place—an I that proper place
with me will be as lar as I can get it from the con-
taminating and dangerous influence of stockjob-
bing and brokers
In conclusion I have d scbarged my duty by di -
daring my sentiments on all iliese subjects in ad-
vance I have addressed myselt to the House, to
the country, and 10 the President elect I have de-
clared my opinions as independenily as I enlerlain
them. I am apprehensive that they will not be ac-
ceptable to some gentlemen of either party, and
that is a proof to me that they an neaily, 11 not
exactly right I trust that they will be acceptable
to General Harrison If I am correctly intormed
of the man, independence and frankness are quali-
ties which he admires, and, if 1 am correctly in-
formed of his political sentiments, he will agree
with many of the opinions which I have advanced
A gentleman near me shakes his head, but, sir, I
do not recognise ihe right of that or any other gen-
tleman to speak to me for Gen Harrison I have
never believed him to be that weak old man that
his enemies have repres-nted him to be I believe
him to possess a sound mind in a sound body, to
be honest, patriotic, and able to project his c%n po-
licy, and 10 speak lor himself. I believe that he
will imitate Washington m calling good and wise
men of various and diffeient views to his councils,,
tb*t he will consider the opinions of all, and then
judge and act for himself At all events, I have
spoken to him, here in my place, of public mea-
sures touching public interests, as I had a right to
speak, and as it was my dutv to speak, indepen-
dently and without reserve He can take no ex
ception to this course, and if he does, he owes me
more than I owe to him—having exerted the best
of my humble powers to elevate him to the Presi-
dency He can easily cancel that small debt by
faithfully redeeming the promises which have
brought him mlo power The sentiments and opi-
nions which I now advance are the same as those
which I advanced befcre his election, and whilst
advocating his pistensions to the Presidency, as all
my friends and constituents and thousand:, of
strangers in various parts of the country know
That he will agree with all these views and opi-
nions I do not expect I will compiomise much
with Gen Harrison, andyic Id mueh to his betier
judgment and mformation I expect to support his
Administration most cordially, and I will do so as
far as I can in conscience, without a sacrifice of
consistency and of vital principle, and with a due
regard to the duty I owe my country I am
the same Republican Whig now as before the elec-
tion—let me not, therefore, be misunderstood or
misrepresented
REMARKS OF MR. MALLORY,
01  VIRGINIA,
In the House of Representatives, February 5,1841—On
the bill providing for   an issue  of  Treasury
Notes
Mr Steínrod, of Virgiim, having obtained
the floor, said that he was desirous oí.addressii g
the House on the various topics which had been
introduced into this discuss on, but as his colleague
[Mr Mallory] hid recently taken his seat,
and had evinced a disposition to addre s the com-
mittee, he would, with pleasure, yield the floor to
him, as the limited time now remaimn , before
he bill would be taken out of committee, would
not allow them boih to occupy the floor
Mr MALLOUY thanked Mr S for his kind-
ness and courtesy, and apologized for obtruding
himself upon the committee at that late hour
Whatever might have been my original intention,
(said Mr M ) the period fixed by the House lor
terminating the discission having nearly arrived,
it is impossible tor me at this time to enter into a
full consideration of this bill, and of the various
topics which have been alluded to in the course of
the debate. Nor, indeed, Mr Chairman, is it ne-
cessary, after ihe able, unansvered, and unan-
swerable argument of my distinguished colleague,
[Mr Wise ] My principal object in rising, sir, is
to notice some remarks of the gentlemen from
Maryland and North Carolina, [Messrs Jfnifer
and Rayner,] in relation to the course he has
deemed it his duty to pursue
The gentleman from Maryland [Mr J ] had
said that "not one position ot my colleague [Mr
Wise] was m unison with his paity," and ' that
his speech was not approved- by a single rohtical
inend ' I ask the guit'tman if I am ronect n
ascribing to him this language? [To this Mi Ju.ni
fer a«sented, and said ' he did not recognise Mr
Mallory a> apl iral friend of M' Wist. "
Now, sir, I do not mean to be r°ad out of church by
the membei from Maryland, or by iny body else,
but I lake this occasion to declare that, wiin one
exception, I fullj ppprove, eradors , and intend
widely to circulate the speech of my colleague I
tnank him, Mr Chairman, for his bold and manly
stand in defence of our interests and principles for,
however offensive it may prove to certain polui-
cians m this Capitol—however he may be denounced
or misrepresented here or elsewhere, unless I am
greatly deceived, the views he ha? advanced will
meet with a hearty and cordial support among those
whom we represent on this floor. They are the
doctrines avowed by fie Htrnson party in lower
Virgmin, during the late canvass, and around
which we mean sti 1 to rally On that ground I
plant my flag, and on that wi'l I stand or fall
When we entered the Harrison party we did not
cempromise our principles, and if the principles of
the late con est are to be in opposition to the
movements of the coming Administration, then, sir,
all that I have to say is, that we have been
deceived ourselves, and that we have deceived
others
But the gentleman from North Carolina [Mr.
Rayner] said that the remarks of my colleague
are "ominous," &c and that he heard ihem "with
pain and surprise" Now, I ask that gentleman
to tell me what principles my colleague has ad-
vanced in his speech which he had not before
avowed? I beg to assure the gentleman they are
the doctrines of the Whigs in Virginia, if they are
noi of the Whigs of North Carolina.
But, sir, what position has my fr.end assumed
that can be construed into an act of hostility to the
measures of General Harrison's administration?
Is a National Bank to be recommended and pushed,
without an opportunity ol consulting the people,
and without regard to the condition of the country?
Wh), sir, General Harrison told us he would not
resort to a bank until all other expedients had
failed, and unless it was called for by a majority
of the people My colleague says, m substance,
the same, so tha here, at least, there is nothing
"ominous" of a difference The President elect is
pledged to adhere to the compromise act on the
tariff, and the mam argument of the gentleman
from Virginia [Mr. Wise] was in favor of that
position.
Mr Jenifer here rose aad said to Mr. Mal-
lory—Define your own position
Mr Mallory to Mr J What, on the to-
bacco question? [Mr J had made a long speech on
this subject a day or two before, and is very active
in getting up conventions, &c. on the tobacco
trade ]
But, «ays the gentleman from North Carolina,
[Mr Rayner,] why did not the honorable member
from Virginia [Mr Wise] wait until General
Harrison   tí ved in this eitvi I answer, why did
not gentlemen who spoke before him adopt the
same plan? I undertake 10 say that my colleague
would have wane I until the arrival of General
Harrison, if others had ihought proper to do the
same. But such had not been the case Other
gent'emen had given their views, witnout reserve,
and he ana his colleague were not going to permit
public opinion to be prejudged, evtu if the mdica-
'10ns d d come from a high quarter.
Mr M said he had listened with much atten-
tion to this debate, and he was yet to hear any
good reason why this bill should not pass, whether
we view it in connection with the present or coming
Administration.
When last he had a seat on this floor, no one was
more decidedly opposed to the policy than him-
self, and, if he did not discuss ths question, it was
be-ause he left it to others who could bring to the
rid of our cause greater poweisof debate and
more weight of cha acter than he laid claim to
Since th«n, our relations have materially changed,
and his vote would be given to suit this variation
I admire (said he) consistency in a politician, but I
like to ste him accommodate his conduct to the
exigencies of the limes and the warns of the
St ite, not make if square with mere pride of opi-
nion or the pr jndiees of party feeling
Whin the question of issuing Treasury notes
was first proposed the party bringing it forward
was flus ed wnh victory, and disposed to rush
headlong into the fi^ld of untried expedients. The
ettled principles of our fathers and the most
cherished institutions of the country were subjects
of the wi.dest experiments, and a radical change 111
the character of our Government sought to be
effected Disapproving the measure as a perma-
nent financial scheme, and fearing that it formed
a link in the series of measures designed to esta-
blish a Government bank, I three times voted
against such a bill As a circulating medium,
taey are every way objectionable, nor do I ap-
prove of resorting to such a process as an ordinary
mode of raising mon^y But in the present aspect
of our affairs, as a tcripjrary expedient lo supply
thj wan s of Government, in the absence of a
better, I feel justified in voting for the bill
Things have matenill) changed The Sub-Trea-
sury, so intimately connected with it, and without
which they are stripped of most of their objections,
as a nataial consequence of the election of Gen
Harrison, will be abandoned     With new men
