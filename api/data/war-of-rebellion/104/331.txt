P. J. OSTERHAUS,Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND, Nashville, April 12, 1865-7 p. m. (Received 2 a. m. 13th.)

General HALLECK:

I have just received the following dispatch from General Wilson.* I have now no doubt but that my dispatch from General Granger of yesterday is essentially correct.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS, Nashville, Tenn., April 12, 1865-10.45 p. m. (Received 11.20 a. m. 13th.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK, Chief of Staff:

The following dispatch from General Hatch, at Eastport, dated yesterday, is forwarded for the information of the Department:

EASTPORT, MISS., April 11, 1865.

My scouts reported Forrest has been badly whipped. Some of his generals captured. Selma was undoubtedly taken and all Government property burned on the 2nd.

General Tillson telegraphs that information was received at Boone, N. C., on the 9th that General Stoneman was at or near Wilkesborough, N. C., on the 30th ultimo, moving down the Yadkin River with the supposed intention of destroying the important railroad bridge over the Yadkin. This is an entirely different route form the one I directed General Stoneman to take before starting out; but as I gave him the discretion if he ascertained there was no necessity for cutting the Tennessee and Virginia Railroad to move toward Danville, either capture the place, if not defended, or, if strongly garrisoned, so to maneuver as to attract and hold the force in Danville, he may have heard of the success of the armies under General Grant and felt himself justified in making this detour from the original direction. I think it will have an important effect on Johnston's movement. I have just this moment seen Mr. Dana's dispatch informing me of the capture of Lynchburg.

GEO. H. THOMAS,Major-General.

MONTGOMERY, ALA, April 12, 1865.

Major E. B. BEAUMONT,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Cavalry Corps:

I occupied the city this morning at 8 o'clock without opposition.

Respectfully, &c.,

E. M. McCOOK,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
