HEADQUARTERS, Louisville, September 24, 1863.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

I have no troops that can be spared for the railroad, having been ordered to send all I could spare to General Burnside. I have concentrated five regiments at Glasgow for this purpose, and they will probably march to-day.

Brigadier-General.

CALHOUN, September 24, 1863.

Lieutenant Colonel Lewis RICHMOND:

Couriers have arrived from Chattanooga. They report General Rosecrans has fallen back to Chattanooga, where he is intrenching.

Granger's command has fallen back across the river; the trains also have crossed the river, but I don't know that it is reliable. The couriers also state that it has been a drawn fight so far. They say we have taken 12,000 prisoners, and that the rebels admit loss of 5,000 killed. Our scouts report two pieces of artillery planted on a hill 3 miles this side of Cleveland.

All is quiet to-night.

R. K. BYRD,

Colonel, Commanding.
