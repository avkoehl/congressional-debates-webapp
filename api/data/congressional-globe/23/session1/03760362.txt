which did not exist in the case of the appointment
by the President and Senate of one oi our own
citizens to a mission abroad
Mr A went at length into theaiguments which
had been employed against the appropriation foi
the Panama mission, to snow that the House was
not precluded from a decision whether a mission
was necessary or otnerwise     As to the proposed
appropriation for a charge d'affaires at Buenos
Ayres, the explanation was not satisfactory    He
was in possession of a publication m the Spanish
language, made by the Government of that Re-
public, containing the correspondence between the
gentleman who had been charged with our interests
there and that Government, which contained ob
servations requiring further explanation than had
been given     He therefore moved to strike out
the items providing for an outfit and salary foi a
charge" d'affaires at Buenos Ayies out of the bill
Mr  WAYNE rose, but gave way to
Mr MERCER, who moved the committee rise,
which was negatived
Ayes G6, noes 81
Mr WAYNE pioceeded to say that the impa
tience of the committee, at hearing a speech at so
late a period of the day, admonished him of the
propriety of permitting the question to be taken
But the earnest manner in which the gentleman
from Massachusetts [Mr AdamsJ had uiged his
objections, induced lum to submit one or two ob
seivauonsin leply to his views upon the power of
the House to examine into the necessity and pio
pnety of foreign missiohs which had Leen estab |
Iished in the usual form In the cases put by the
gentleman, he believed theie wis no memoer of
the House who doubted the nghtof the House to
interpose their opinions But a broad distinction
existed between those cases and the present heie
was a mission, established and recognised year
after year by the House In these cases nothing
of that kind existed The principle of the resolu-
tion introduced by thegentleman from Tennessee
[Mr Polk] upon the lot of April, 1826, relative
to the Parama mission, which had been alluded
to, could not be extended to the present case The
object of that mission was not the usual diplomatic
intercourse recognised by the laws of rations It
was there pi oposed to send ministers to a congress
of nations here it is meiely proposed to continue
a mission long since established
Mr W íeplied to the other positions taken by
Mi Adams, with much force, when the question
was taken, and the motion to strike out negatived

The item pioviding outfits for a minister to Rus-
sia and a charge to Buenos Ay res having been
lead—
Mr ARCHER mo\ed to amend the clause by
mseiting outfits for chargfs des affuues to Chili
and Biazil, which, aftei a brief exolanation from
that gentleman, was agreed to
The item foi salaries for agents of claims at
London and Pans having been read,
Mr W  R DAVIS suggested tint the office of
agent for claims at Pans being no longer neces
sary, it would be better to change the name of the
allowance to that of salary to the con&ul
Mi POLK, after an explanation on ihesubject,
said that if any change of phraseology was
regarded as impoitant, it could be done when the
bill came before the House
When the items providing appropnations for
completing custom houses at New London, Mid
dletown, New Bedfoid, Newburyport, and Balti
mo're, were read,
Mr McKAY stated at length the vanous sums
apnropnated heretofore foi these objects and the
estimates made for their completion, and contended
that in some instances the amounts named in the
bill were'arger than were necessary Aftermovmg
to reduce the amount at Middletown, which was
carried, Mr McK said he was extremely unwil
ling to detain the committee at so late an hour, but
believing, as he did, that a profuse expéndame
had been gone into on these subjects, he would
suspend the further motions he had pi oposed to
make until the bill came into the House
Mr rOLK said there were a few amendments
which he had in charge from the Committee of
Ways and Means to offer, which he could do; o
forma, m ordei that 'hey might come up in the
House      Mr   P   accordingly pioposed several
additional items to the bill, some of which were
adopted, and others rejected
Mr ARCHER said he was instructed by the
Committee on Foreign Affairs to move two or three
amendments, which he would now do, without
intending to discuss them at this time. They were
accordingly pioposed and adopted
On motion of Mi POLK, the committee then
rose and reported the bill and amendments to the
House
Mr POLK moved that the bill, as amended, be
printed
Mr EVANS suggested the propnety of print-
ing also the amendments which had been proposed
and rejected, to which Mr Poli>. assented, and it
was ordered accordingly
Mr PiNCKNEY,"by consent, moved that when
the House adjourns, it adjourn to meet on Mon-
day next, which was agreed to

PETITIONS.
Mr S1LSBEE said he desired to piesent a
memorial trom that section of New England which
was extensively ei gaged in the fishing business
They complained ot great pecuniaiy di tiess and
pressure, and injury to their commeice, owing
to the removal ot the deposites He moved the
usual refeience of the memorial, and, aftei being
read,
Mr FORSYTH said he thought he understood
that this memorial came fiom a district of country
engaged in the business of fishing, complaining of
the destiuctionof then commeice We had heard
much of distress in the country, and we had me-
morials presented on the subject eveiy day, and
honoiable gentlemen here proclaimed that great
distiess and reductions in the prices of various
pioducts was piocueed by the late measures of
the President As to other great objects of in-
dustry, the pnces current showed how correct
they were He would ask the gentleman who
presen ed this memorial what the price of oil was>
Mi S1LSBEE replied, that he had not taken
much time to inform himself He believed that
oil was fiom 7Ü to 75 cents a gallon, what the
ordinal y price was, he could not say It sold at
from 90 to 100 cent3 by the small quantity, and
he would ttll thegentleman that shijis employed
in the whale fishing had depieciated ?5 per cent
He also hoped the gentleman from Geoigia did
not mean to say tba he (Mr S ) had occupied
much time in discussions upon presenting memo
nils
Mr TORSYTH did rot intend charging the
honorable gertleman with having occupied the
time of the Senate by speaking upon memorials
lie would do him no such injustice, buthealluded
to all the gentlemen on that side of the House
As regarded the distiess of the people of New
Bedfoid, he thought the memorial said tha  ten
thousand seamen weie affected by the act of the
Executive, and the honorable member told us thai,
the object for which the sailors weie employed
boie the oidmary price Mr F said that fiom
his experience and observation, 70 to 76 cents was
a veiy living price for fish oil, and while it stood
at that, the sailors would be engaged in the busi-
ness But it was said that the equipments of
vessels was much reduced in price, and that a
deficiency in the value of ships of 25 per cent
had taken place But Mi F thought that upon
examination, it would be seen that this was not
founded in fact The cues of distress were got
I up, not m the sections from which these memorials
came, butelsewhere Theheaviestcrycamefrom
Baltimore, and there the pressure was extreme
He held in his hand the prices cunent in Balti
more, and from that it would seem that the prices
weie good Fish, shad, were $6 50, and herring
$3 50 per barrel, flour, sales of Howard street at
jo per ban el. The article of sugar he would ad-
vert to for the benefit of the gentleman from Lou-
isiana, [Mr Poeifr ] it was $7 to $8 50, and he
had heard a very large ciop was sold lately in
Philadelphia at 8 cents Tobacco $3 50 Cotton
¿2'z  to  13—holders firm, and  expecting better
prices Mr F hoped gentlemen would look at
the prices current fiom the various parts of the
country from which these memorial  come He
believed that peisons doing business on credit
might be suffering embarrassment, but he denied
that there was any d stress pressing on the great
objects of the country
Mi WEBSTER said that the theory of the
honorable member fiom Georgia was facti'ious,
and not leal. But he thought the slightest refei-
ence to the great interests of the whale fisheries
would convince any man that it must be most
affected by causes disturbing the general credit of
the country, owing to the long credits which the
business required,and therefoie the gentleman was
mistaken ¡n applying his remarks to the people of
New Bedford Tne fishing business was almost
the sole business of New Bedford and Nantucket,
and the time was when, with no other trade, they
had fiom seventy to eighty ships engaged in it
bejond the capes of Good Hope and Horn. They
must theiefoie deal on credit, and then cry was
not false clamor But we weie told by honorable
gentlemen that when the question was settled,
prospenty would revive Well, a decision had
been made a month ago, by a majority of half a
hundred votes, that the bank should not be íechai-
tered, and yet the country is not settled, but is
further fio n it than ever
Mr TORSYTH replied, that he had not said
that there was no cause of distress in the country,
and that all the complaints sent here were false
clamor He admitted there was distress in some
poitions of the country, ansirg fiom the abridg-
ment of banking accommodations, and the derange-
ment of the excharges of the country He believed
that distress did exist among business men whose
accommodations had stopped, and where runs had
been made upon banks having no metallic basis
to suppoit them What he said was this that
there was no foundation for the Cry of distress,
when we looked to the puces of the products of
labor upon the forest, the ocean, or the earth
And what were they ? All the prices showed them
to be as high now as they were this time last year,
or higher than they weie at the time when, accord-
ing to the statements of honorable genth men, the
country was oveiflowmg with prospenty The
prices cuirent were so over the whole Uni ed
States In Boston, on the 28th April, in the arti-
cle of coffee, the pnces were rising [Mr F here
read from the newspaper report of prices current ]
Now, as to the article of cotton in Boston, four
thousand bales were sold on manufactuier's ac-
count So that all the manufactories were not
stopped yet New Orleans cotton thnteen to fif-
teen, flour in demand and scarce, and he hoped,
when this news of the flour market reached New
Orleans, it would use there Fish and molasses
as high as last year, sugar, prices firm, and sup-
plies limited Now, gentlemen said that the great
necessaries of life were high, because the people
must eat But here all the prices were given Tie
lumber trade, too, stood, m the same condition as
it did this time last year, when we were enjoying
the most unbounded prosperity
But the gentleman from Massachusetts said that
he (Mi F ) was mistaken in regard to the New
Bedford people What he (Mr r ) stated was,
that the persons engaged in the whale fishing, if it
be admitted that the article of then pursuit in busi-
ness is as high as usual, cannot be suffering dis
tress But the gentleman from Massachusetts tells
us of great rivalry existing m the New Bedford
and Nantucket fisheries And what were the ele
ments of this nvahy' Let us examine the sub-
ject a little The people of New Bedford and
Nantucket are, beyond all doubt, unrivaled by the
world in nautical skill and enterprise But the
caséis different in other parts of the world, where
the expenses of an outfit, &c , are very great
There they are much cheaper But the gentleman
from Massachusetts said that their business was
deranged, because they puichased on a credit
The materials were all there, and the only differ-
ence was that those who had not capital could not
get it Mr F said his remarks applied to the
sailors in that service, as the memorial referred to
ten thousand sailors who were injuriously affected
by the measures of the Administration lie be-
lieved that the sailors engaged in those voyages for
a share of the piofits of the voyage.   Well, how
