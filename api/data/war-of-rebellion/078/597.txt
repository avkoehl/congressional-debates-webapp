Commanding DIVISION:

GENERAL: The major-general commanding directs me to inclose you copy of dispatch from General Lee. * He orders that you send the Fifth MISSISSIPPI and Seventh Tennessee Regiments immediately to Grenada, supplying them with forty rounds of ammunition to the man, and arming and equipping them from other commands of your DIVISION; supplying them also with three days' cooked rations. They will travel at the rate of thirty-five miles per day, and farther if necessary. Send couriers and officers immediately on to Grenada in advance, to get up supplies of forage for these regiments at Grenada in advance. The command will move by Pontotoc and Houston direct to Grenada, unless movements of the enemy require a change of route. Should the enemy be below on the Central railroad they will co-operate with General Wirt Adams. The couriers sent in advance will report to the commands. You are ordered to send forward all information obtained. You will instruct Colonel Duckworth to report promptly to these headquarters and to General S. D. Lee at Demopolis all movements of the enemy.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
