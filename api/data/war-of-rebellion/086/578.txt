PLEASANT HILL, November 15, 1864.

Colonel JOHN F. PHILIPS,

Warrensburg:

Just in from the scout. Sixty-four guerrillas and stragglers from Price's army, under one Captain Shepherd, left Texas Prairie, Greenton Valley, and the Snibar Hills Sunday, going south. I chases some of them Sunday evening on Texas Prairie. They halted and fed on Big Creek Sunday night and then pushed on south. I think there are but few behind in La Fayette. Saw Captain Peery this morning at Kingsville.

SAINT LOUIS, November 15, 1864-3.55 p. m.

Brigadier-General SANBORN,

Commanding District of Southwest Missouri, Springfield, Mo.:

I have established an artillery camp near Franklin, Mo., and wish to draw in all the artillery not required for active field service, as the fall campaign is over. I think that you will not have any use for a battery this winter, and, if you think it advisable, I will place both your batteries in winter quarters at Franklin for drill, &c. I also think it advisable on account of forage as it must be scarcer at Springfield. The batteries will be at once refitted, and in case of necessity could be sent to you in five days.

Colonel and Chief of Artillery, Department of the Missouri.

Please send a courier to overtake Colonel Winslow and direct him to proceed to this place, via Louisville, and as rapidly as he can.
