which exhibits a great reduction not only in the number, but also in the form of the disease. The total number of patients in the contagious hospital this day is only 113; in October and November it was over 200. My letter of the 7th instant to you, and that of Doctor Sillman, of November 5, to the Surgeon-General, advises the erection of a tent hospital on the Jersey shore, which I will have done as soon as Surgeon Silliman advises me to do so. On account of the great abatement of the disease I have ample hospital room here, and Doctor Sillman and myself are of the opinion that the erection of a new frame hospital would be a useless and unnecessary expense, and before it could be accomplished the disease will most probably have entirely disappeared. Awaiting your final decision in this matter,

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. SCHOEPF,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Post.
