General S. COOPER, Adjutant and Inspector GENERAL:

GENERAL: I thank you for your letter of the 12th, which I have just received, with copies of so much of Special Orders, Nos. 176 and 184, as define the limits of General Bragg's command, and your telegram to me of July 31. These papers cannot be misunderstood. As my apology for having troubled you more than once on this subject, I respectfully inclose copies of your telegram and Paragraph VII, Special Orders, Numbers 176, as I received them originally,* one marred by the operator, the other without the important line following the name "WEST Point. "

Most respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. E. Johnston.

ADDENDA.

MORTON, August 2, 1863.

Honorable JAMES A. SEDDON, Richmond:

Your letter of July 24 received. The order concerning rolling stock of Mississippi railroads was to destroy rather than permit it to fall into the enemy's hands. The enemy has fallen back, and the superintendents of roads have been promised protection if they repair. I hope to be able soon to draw supplies again from the country through which the Mississippi Central Railroad passes.

J. E. Johnston.
