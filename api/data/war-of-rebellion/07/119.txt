from Kentucky to Jacksborough. I have no doubt that the enemy will attempt an advance on Knoxville at an early day.

Very respectfully, sir, your obedient servant,

No. 2. Report of Lieutenant Colonel J. W. White, First Tennessee Cavalry.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST TENNESSEE CAVALRY REGIMENT, Camp Schooler, Morgan County, Tenn., February 3, 1862.

SIR: I have the honor to report that a portion of our regiment engaged the enemy on yesterday at about 12 o'clock 13 miles northwest of this place. A running fight for nearly an hour ensued in the mountains. The enemy's force is variously estimated from 100 to 300, armed with Minie muskets and rifles.

We killed their captain, and, from the best information, 5 others; captured 4 horses, 2 fine Minie muskets, 1 Colt's navy pistol, a small quantity of ammunition, and 1 prisoner.

Inclosed I send you certain papers found by me on the person of their dead captain.*

It gives me please to say that we lost only 1 horse killed and a few slight scratches. Our men all acted bravely for raw troops.

I cannot forbear to mention the gallant conduct of Captain Brown, of Company C, and Sergeant Reagan, of Company F.

I am satisfied that the Federal Army in force is approaching us; I think by way of Williamsburg, Ky., through Chitwood's Gap. It is raining and the waters are up, so we cannot well get out of here; but I will move Captains McKenzie's and Gorman's companies, if possible, to-morrow on Jacksborough.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your, &amp;c.,J. W. WHITE,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding First Tennessee Cavalry.
