HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF NORTH CAROLINA,Wilmington, January 7, 1865.

Major General W. C. WHITING,

Commanding Third Military District, Wilmington:

GENERAL: Judging from an indorsement of yours on a letter of Major J. W. Cameron, dated January 6, 1865, that you have not received General Orders, Numbers 16,* from these headquarters, announcing that officer as chief quartermaster of this department, the commanding general directs me to inquire whether such is the fact.

I have the honor to be, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ARCHER ANDERSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS,Wilmington, January 7, 1865.

Lieutenant Colonel ARCHER ANDERSON,

Asst. Adjt. General, Hdqrs. Department of North Carolina:

COLONEL: In reply to your note of inquiry of to-day, relative to Major Cameron, I have to say that I have received General Orders, Numbers 16, announcing him as chief quartermaster of the department; but to add for the information of the general commanding, concerning the indorsement to which reference is made, that I have received on order relieving Major Cameron from his duties as district quartermaster at Wilmington, assigned by command of the Secretary of War, in which capacity he has been and still is considered as chief quartermaster on my staff, for the especial defense of this place. (See Special Orders, Nos. 141, 166, and 229, of 1863.) I presume that General Orders, Numbers 16, was called for by the emergency of the enemy's sudden attack, but with no intention of depriving me of the services of that officer. If such is the intention I beg you will inform me.

Very respectfully,

W. H. C. WHITING,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF NORTH CAROLINA,Wilmington, January 7, 1865.

Major General W. H. C. WHITING,

Commanding, &amp;c., Wilmington:

GENERAL: In answer to your note of this date, I am instructed to say that the commanding general did not deem it necessary, with an officer of your experience, to state in terms in assigning Major Cameron to duty as chief quartermaster of the department, that he was relieved from duty on your staff. The two positions are incompatible; and General Orders, Numbers 16, is to be so constructed.

I have the honor to be, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ARCHER ANDERSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
