My cavalry entered Marshfield, 22 miles from Springfield, yesterday. Found no rebel force, and fell back to Colonel Carr's camp at Widow Stark's, on Gasconade, near main road to Lebanon. Will direct for few days' rest at Lebanon. Weather too severe to operate. Will dispense with hospital, as directed by the general. It was to be rough and plain, and much needed.
