CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

It is to be made up by a tax oa them. This
borrowed capital and tax are to be brought to this
city and placed in the hands of nine men, to do
what they please with it—to distribute it to distant
offices to be lent to their private friends and ac-
quaintances. The loaning capacity of these nine
men is nothing, but they may hand it to others to
loan out. Whatever is to be done with it, is to be
done in secret, and kept irom the people. Now,
is it not better to leave this money in the people's
own pockets, and let them dispose ot it themselves?
What right has Congress to lend money at all?
That question is no new question of discussion.
Has it ever been settled tbat Congress has
that right? Then if Congress has no such right—if
the Government has no such right—if no individual
connected with any of these Departments ha-> the
n¿Ht—neither collectively nor separately—how
can the n§ht be derived from the-i through a thing
of their creation? The truih is, when it is pro-
posed to establish a corporation to do what you
cannot do yourselves, you errct something to de
ceive the people into a belief that it has a vitality
and power which its creator had not, and conse-
quently could not impart, bui which has a sort of
mystenousness about it that serves to bund those
who look at it into some vague belief in its ca-
pacity
Mr. LINN said he supposed he had precisely
the same right as any oiher Senator on that floor
to speak his sentiments freely, and to take as wide
a range of debate as he might think proper, ad
verting to whatever topic he might deem necessary,
whether connected with the motion under discus-
sion or not He would proceed on this assumption
of right, till stopped, but it the Senate pronounced
that, in this course, he was out of order, and should
not go on, he would, oí course, submit, but then
he would require the same rule to be apphed to
others as to him. Having said so much by way
of preface, he would now begin by reminding the
gentlemen on the other side, of a good old saying
of a celebrated Roman Consul—whica they cannot
be reminded of too often—that men out of powtr
entertain very different sentiments from those they
are governed by when in power Ihis ísthesaj-
mg of a very brave and wise Consul of a great
ancient Republic, and should net be too easily for-
gotten. Pie (Mr. Linn) knew very well that the
Democratic party was considered the dregs of the
earth by the favored few who contrived to rule
every thing He knew that even women and
children were persuaded that none but those favor-
ed few and their families, and the wives and daugh-
ters of bank directors, were fit society for any one
of fashionable or decent notions The doors of
such people were shut against the best young men
in the country, if they were known to entertain De-
mocratic notions, as if they were something be-
neath the notice of good society But there were
some placps yet lef\. where these unfashionable
Democrats might raise up their voices He (Mr.
Linn) would, for his part, make a few remarks
here, and in doing so he intended to be as pointed
as possible, for he had now, he found, to contend
for liberty of speech, and while any of that liberty
was left, he would give his remarks the utmost
bounds consistent with his own sense of what was
due to himself, his constituents, and the country.
The Whigs, during the late Administration, had
brought to bear a system of assault against the ma-
jority in power, which might justly be characterized
as frivolous and vexatious, and nothing elsx, yet
they had always been treated by the majority with
courtesy and forbearance, and the utmost latitude
of debate had been alio fed them without interrup-
tion In a session of six months, they consumed
the greater part of the time in m speeches for elec-
tioneering effect, so that only twen'y-eight b Us were
passed. These electioneering speeches, on „11 oc-
casions that could be started, whe'her the presen-
tation of a petition, motion on a resolut on, or dis-
cussion of a bill, were uniformly and «tudiously of
the most insulting character to the inajon' , w*>ose
mildest form ot designation was "collar men," and
other epithets equally degrading How often had
it been said of the other branch of Congress, " What
could be expected from a House so constituted'"
Trace back the course of that party, step by step,
to 1834, and it may be tracked in blood The out-
rages m New York m that year are not forgotten
The fierce and fiendish spirit of s'rne and usurpa
tion which prompted the seizure of the public arms,
to turn them against those who were their fellow-
citizens, is yet fresh as ever, and ready to wm its
way to what it aims at What was done then, un-
der the influence and shadow of the great money
power, may be done again
He (Mr. Li\n) had marked them, and nothing
should restrain him lrom doing his duty and stand-
ing up in the front rank of opposition to keep them
from the innovations they meditated Neither the
frown nor men?ce of any leader of that party
—i o lofty bearing or shaking of the mane—
would deter him frcm the tearless and honest dis-
chargt of thoie obligations which were due to his
constituents eai to the country Ae next ad
veiled to tie condjet of the Whig pany when
the Sut-Treasury was under discussion, and re-
minded the present party in powei of the forbear-
ance with which the had been treated, contrasting
that tieatment with the manifestations row made
to the minority. We are now, said Mr Linn in
conclusion, to be checked; but I tell the Senator
from ICentuckv, and any other Senator who
chooses to tread in his steps, that he is about to deal
a double handed game at which two can play He
is welcome to try his kill But I would expect
that some on tnat side are not prepared to go quite
so far, and that there is yet among them sufficient
liberally to counter!al'nce political feeling, and
induce ihem not to obj ct to our right of spending
as much ime m tijmg u improve their billas they
have taken themselves to c íp and pare and shape it
to their own fancies
Mr WALKER «aid, m reply to the remark of
the Senator from Kentucky, [Mr Clay,] lhat
those who were opnosed to the bill were endeavor
mg to make it «.dious by die amendments they
proposed, lha' he had n t, and would not, pur ue
such a coursa On the contrary, feeling lhat this
bill was 11 ely to beco <ie a law, he had voied
alone for tsio-e amendment  which, in his opinion,
went tc improve the bill Influenced by this mo
tive, he had voted for amendments proposed by the
Senator from K ntucky and his friends, and op
posed some of those which were proposed by his
(Mr W'o) political friends He held that the course
which the Senator from Kentucky had unjustly
attributed to the opponents of the bill, would be
entirely improp r and unparliamentary With re-
gard to the remark of the Senater as to the time
consumed by the epponer.s oi the bill, nearly two
days were otcupied m discussing five a nendments
proposed by himself, (Mr W ) and four of which
were adopted Did the Senator attribute to a ma-
jority of the body <i design to render the bdl odious2
And what were those amendments which he (Mr.
W ) had proposed, and which had been adopted?
The first was to permit any ten or more stock-
holders, or their agent, to inspect all the proceed
mgs of the Bank, including individual accoun's,
the second was, that upon all discounts over one
thousand dollars, where any director dissented, the
vote should be taken by ayes and noes, and the>e be
open to inspection, so as to secura individual re-
sponsibility, and prevent abuses—t^e third vas io
prevent any directoi any v/here from being liab'e
to the Bank hi mo e than ten thousand dollars, so
as to prevent these direc ors loanm  out to them
selves one fi urth of (hi* woole lopns of the Bank,
as it was officially proved the} had done in many
States—and fourthly, 'h- amendment prohibiting
any loan or discount to any member of either
House ( f Congress—and v a not this righ ? Ought
we, first by our votes to crea'e a Bank, pat into
it, in stock and deposites, more than twenty mil-
lions of the public money, and ¡hen draw from this
Bank as much mon-y as we could ohtai i from
this Bank, crejted by our voet 1 Besides, w~ were
to detemin  each }e?r, whether the public mo-
neys c uld contirue on denosne in th - Bank—'re
Senaie were to vote upon the appointment of at
least o-u-inird of ¡he directors every year, and
both Htuses were annualh, f < ley pkased, to
investigate all the mdn ¡dual accounts ard Dusmess
of the Bank, and was it propet we itiould be bor-
rowers, and might we not 'ear that investigation
would be voted down, when forty four members of
Congress should be again borrowers from the
Bank to the amount of halt a million, as it was
officially reported by Mr. Clayton that they were
in 1832? Was if odicus to apply to members of
Congress the sacred prayer, "lead us not into temp-
tation"—to prevent their being placed in a situa-
tion, as. to this Bank, m which we are told by Holy
Writ, that the borrower was the servant of the lend-
ei? Was it odious, by avoiding these Bank loans,
to lift the reptesentatives of the States and of the
people, above derogatory suspicions, and above all
imputations, true or false?
He appealed then to the Senate and to the Sena-
tor from Kentucky himself, whether it was just to
characterize these amendments, all adopted in part
by the aid of his friends, as designed to make the
bill odious'
As to the amendment proposed by the Senator
from New York, he was in favor of it. We are
told lhat it is necessary for the Government to sub-
seribe to the amouut of lea or perhaps sixteen mil-
lions to secure the public money which may be on
deposite. The Secretary ot ihe Treasury seems to
thinif that the average amount on deposite will be
four millions, although Mr. W. thought it would
be six millions Then we have to subscribe six-
teen millions to secure four or six millions. This
was an extraordinary rate of insurance, and one to
which he should not give his consent
Mr ALLEN wished to correct an error that
nad fallen from an honorable Senator opposite,
and ihit was in attributing the defalcation of
Swartwout as a fiuit of the Independent Treasury,
which was not in existence until a considerable
time after his defa'cations were discovered. They
took place under the State bank deposite system,
and would have taken place had the United States
Bank system been m existence So far as he
knew, and if the fact had been otherwise, it would
have been made public, not a single dollar has
been lost since the establishment of the Indepen-
deni Treasury,and this was a sufficient comment on
the system itself
It i? contended on the other side, also, in oppo-
sition to this amendment, and in igvor of the con-
nection of the Government wilhthii Bank, that it
will be a profitable speculation, and the results of
the old Bank connection are adduced to show how
many millions were made by it This Govern-
ment is invoked to become a speculator m stocks'
Suppose there was a hundred millions made by
the connec ion with the late Bank How was it
made? Off ef whom was it made? The people
The people And this system of speculating on
people is well kept up in the bill reported from the
commutee this morning, and which is now on your
lable, to distribute the revenue from the sale of the
public lands This bill professes, to give the peo
pie of the States three millions annually, but does
not tell them that three millions anj a half are to
be raised by taxes from the same people to supply
Us place m carrying on the operations of the G-o-
ment The Slates may with propriety say as said
one of the ?ncient heroes ' I fear ihe Greeks, though
ihev bring gift m their hands " The proposition is
m reality to give three millions, and to taks back
three millu ni and the expense attending the collec-
ticn a>~d distribution of it
Mr WRIGHT then moved to strike out from
the 0 h section of the bill that part which provides
if the amount of stock to be taken by individuals,
States, or corporatio «¡, is not subscribed for before
the 20 h Dece nber next, the Secretary of the Trea-
sury 'hall subsenbe for the residue, and be em-
powe  d to oeh it afterwards at not ¡ess than cost.
Mr W referred to the argument of gentlemen on
i the question last before the Senate The Go-
vernment was to subscribe ten millions to give se-
carity to the pablic deposites, amounting, as the
I Secretary says, to four milliops, but which, in his
(Mr W s) opinion, need not amount to half that
' sum Then the Government was to borrow ten
millions of dollars to place with the direc ors, to in-
duce htm to keep four millions safely, and not
content wnh lhat, we are io borr w s.iv millions
more What was the effect of this? If this bill is
passed, yon send out a Bank charter with a notice
that you have already  taken, instead of one-fifth,
