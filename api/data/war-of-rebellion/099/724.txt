Colonel W. W. WRIGHT,

Chief Engineer, &amp;c., New Berne:

Of curse I cannot ask you to retard the work so much as you say it would to try to use the railroad bed for wagons. I will do the best I can, having stores left at Core Creek Station until you reach Rouse['s Station. General Schofield will be in town to- day. Please see him and explain matters fully.

J. D. COX,

Major- General, Commanding.
