a Captain McCants has sent in his resignation; not yet heard from.

b Lieutenant Perrin forwarded his resignation not yet heard from.

c Lieutenant Fitzpatrick on post duty-lost a hand; Lieutenant Hopwood unheard of since November, 1863. Their places should be filled.

Under this head I will mention that the constructions forges which each battalion now have (one to each) are to be taken away. I consider them indispensable, as which them the battalion quartermaster in enabled to keep the transportation in repair, to shoe the mules, and to weld the tires when they break. It is impossible to get sufficient heat on the battery forges.

I need an inspector on my staff, and have recommended Sergt. George O. Jordon, of Turner's battery. He has been a sergeant in that (formerly Smith's) battery since the beginning of the war. He received a military education at Lexington, Va.: he is intelligent, temperate, vigilant, and brave, and I have noticed him on the field and in the camp, and think him deserving of promotion. His recommendation has been forwarded.

Respectfully submitted.

Major, Commanding Art. Regiment, Hardee's Corps, Army of Tenn.

General J. E. JOHNSTON,

Commanding:

GENERAL: Having, under instructions from Richmond, visited this army for the purpose of inspecting its artillery, conferring with yourself in relation thereto, and presenting such views toward its full efficiency as my experience may suggest, and having devoted to the facts ten days' careful examination and reflection, I have now the honor to submit for your consideration the results to which my judgment is brought.
