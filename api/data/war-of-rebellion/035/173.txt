Brigadier-General GILLMORE, Lexington, Ky.:

Have you any definite information regarding strength of enemy, character of his force, or other important particulars? If not, call upon Carter for it at once, and furnish it to these headquarters. General Burnside's force expected every moment, and will be pushed forward without delay. Answer.

Brigadier General Q. A. GILLMORE, Lexington, Ky.:

I do not yet credit the report in regard to enemy's numbers, but it may possible by true. Your instructions to General Carter to fall back of Dick's River, making it your first line of defense, is approved. By watching the crossings strictly, you can hold a large force in check. Watch well that the enemy does not pass north, either toward Frankfort or Lebanon, and if he does, follow him closely. Concentrate your forces as rapidly as practicable, so as to be able to use them effectively. General Burnside has arrived, and will have here some 6,000 of his old corps by to-morrow. He has sent Captain Goddard to see you, to get any information he can, learn the route, &amp;c.

Brigadier-General GILLMORE, Lexington, Ky.:

Governor Robinson asks if it is necessary to take any steps for the safety of the State archives. I have given my opinion that there is no immediate danger. Keep him advised. No troops can be sent from here till some arrive to-night, and none are at Louisville. You must, therefore, look to the safety of Frankfort with the troops you have. Send the information regarding the enemy, called for this morning. Since Carter has crossed the river, you are safe at Lexington, and ought to be able to send a battery of artillery, with further infantry support, to Frankfort. Officers in command should be instructed to hold that place. This position is of the strongest, and can easily be defended.

Gov. J. F. ROBINSON, Frankfort, Ky.:

I am in constant expectation of getting more definite information regarding the enemy. As at present advised, I do not believe Frankfort
