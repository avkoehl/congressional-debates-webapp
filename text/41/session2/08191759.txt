Mr. DAVIS. Mr. President, gentlemen have
this morning expressed their wish that there
were no bonds of the United States iu Europe.
I think it' my proposition should be adopted
their wishes will soon be achieved ; the bonds
wiil come home, and the accumulated interest
upon them will remain at home instead of being
ser.t to Europe to enrich European capitalists.
I now propose to give some facts to the Sen-
ate in relation to our public debt. Our debt,
interest bearing and non-interest bearing, at
present amounts to about two thousand five
hundred million dollars. I believe it is the
largest nationaldebt in the world except that
of England. _ The English debt, according to
my information, amounts to about three thou-
sand seven hundred and fifty million dollars,
exceeding the present debt of the United States
about one thousand two hundred and fifty mil-
lion dollars. The English debt had its origin
in the reign of Queen Anne. It reached its
maximum point about the year 1815 or 1816,
upon the fall of Bonaparte. It was upward
of one hundred years in its accumulation. In
the beginning the English took an extensive
part in the wars of Europe, the object of which
was to repress the power of France under Louis
XIV, iu which her armies were led by thegreat
captain, the Duke of Marlborough. The latter
portion of her debt was created in her colossal
and continued wars against the first Napoleon,
in which she subsidized so many of the Euro-
pean Powers. While her debt, which exceeds i
ours.about one third, was upward of one hun- j
dred years in its formation, ours was made in j
some five or six or seven years.
Now, Mr. President, how was the debt of i
the United States contracted? By the Gov- j
ernment issuing its bonds for sale in a depre-
ciated currency. The formation of our debt >
in the way of the issue and sale of bonds com-
menced in the year 1862. In that year the ag-
gregate amount of bonds put upon the market
was $60,982,450. What did the United States
receive in coin or in the value of coin for those
bonds? It received $44,030,649. In 1863,
the subsequent year, the Government put into
market an aggregate of $160,987,550 of bonds.
They were sold for depreciated paper currency;
and what was the value of that currency in gold
and silver coin received by the United States?
One hundred and, one million eight hundred
and ninety thousand eight hundred and fifty
dollars. In 1864 the Government put into
market an aggregate of $381,292,250 of bonds,
which were sold for the same depreciated
paper; and what was the gold value of the de-
preciated paper which those bonds brought?
It was $181,697,636, or nearly two hundred
million dollars less than the nominal amount
of the bonds sold.
In 1865 the Government put into market
an aggregate of bonds of $279,746,150. The
receipts for it were in depreciated paper,
worth in gold and silver coin $208,214,090. In
1866 the Government put into market bonds
in the aggregate amounting to $124,914,400.
The gold value of the paper received for
them upon their sale by the Government was
§88,591,773. In 1807 the Government put
into market again $421,469,550 of bonds.
Hie depreciated currency received for them
upon their sale amounted in the aggregate to
$308,215,303 in coin value. In 1868 the Gov-
ernment put into market $425,443,800 of bonds,
and received the same depreciated currency
for them, worth in gold and silver coin $312,-
820,323.
The bonds of which I have thus far spoken
were six per cent, bonds. I will now run ,
through the five percent, bonds in the same way.
Of five per cent, bonds in 1864 $71,110,450
were issued, anil the paper that bought them
was worth then in gold and silver $35,375,383.
In 1865 $100,390,200ofthe five per cent, bonds
were sold. The paper paid for them was worth
in gold and silver $70,202,987. In 1866 there
were but $300 of these live per cent, bonds
sold, and the paper paid for them was worth
in gold and silver $213. In 1867 there were
$340,000 of the five per cent, bonds sold, and
the paper paid for thein was worth $244,604.
In 1868 there were of five per cent bonds sold
$23,298,600, and the paper paid for them was
worth in gold $17,131,460. j
I got these figures from an officer of the
Treasury during the latter part of last year, '
and a very high and faithful officer. The aggre- !
gate amount of the six per cent, bonds during
the years I have specified was $1,854,836,200. !
They were all bought for greenbacks and depre- !
ciated paper currency, and the gold value of 1
the aggregate amount of this depreciated cur-
rency which the Go'vernment received for them
was $1,248,466,625; being less than the nom-
inal amount of the bonds by $606,369,575. In
other words, the amount of usury in the princi-
pal of the six percent, bonds amounts to $606,-
369,575. The interest upon these bonds has
been paid semi-annually at six per cent, per
annum. I have made an estimate of the usurious
interest that has been paid by the Government
upon these bonds, calculating it, not semi-an-
nually, but annually. No lawyer, no intelligent
man will dispute the position that where there
is usury in a note and the interest is paid upon
the nominal amount of the note at six per cent,
per annum, that payment of interest is to an
extent usurious, and it is usurious to this ex-
tent: the value of the commodity, the depre-
i ciated paper which was given for the purchase
! of the note at the time it was bought, is to
be ascertained in gold. The legal rate of
interest payable on that bond is six per cent,
per annum upon the value in gold and silver of
the note. No gentleman will dispute that,
not even my learned friend from Oregon, [Mr.
Williams.]
Well, sir, these bonds were sold by the
Government at a heavy discount. What was
the amount of interest which, according to
equity and conscience and law, the Govern-
ment was bound to pay upon these bonds
by the tenor and the words of the bonds them-
selves? Not six per cent, interest upon the
nominal amount of the bonds, but six per cent,
interest upon the gold value of the bonds at
the time they were purchased by the holder—
upon the gold value of the medium of depre-
ciated paper circulation that was paid by the
purchaser of the bonds at the time they were
purchased. I have made a calculation on that
point. 1 have scaled the amount of the bonds
by the gold value of the medium which was |
paid for the bonds at the time they were sold, j
Upon that gold value I have computed interest
at six per cent. I have computed interest at
six per cent, upon the nominal amount of the
bonds, and the difference between the interest ;
upon the nominal amount of the bonds and
the gold value of the commodity paid for them
I treat as the law treats, as usury; and we shall
see presently what it amounts to.
The aggregate of the six per cent, bonds
according to these figures was $1,854,836,200,
and the aggregate of the five per cent, bonds
$195,139,550. The two aggregates make j
over two billion dollars. I have stated the
amount of usury in the six per cent, bonds at
$606,369,575 ; and the amount of usury iu the
five per cent, bonds was $72,185,090. Now,
the excess of usurious interest paid upon these
bonds above six per cent, per annum upon the
gold value of the paper which was given ior
these bonds is in the six per cent, bonds
$166,563,091. By the same rule the amount
of usurious interest paid on the five per cent,
bonds is $18,335,386. The aggregate of the
usury paid in interest added to the usury in
the amount of theprincipal of the bonds makes
$863,453,142.
Now, according to the equity of the case,
that is the amount with which these bonds
ought to be charged. The amount, then, of
usury paid and of usury in the bonds is $863,-
453,142, which ought, by the principles of equity
as administered by any court of chancery, to be
indorsed as a credit on the aggregate amount
of the bonds, and then, instead of there being
$2,049,975,750 of bonds, there would be but
$l,186,522,608outstand ing now. But, sir,what
does this measure propose to do ? It proposes
to secure to these bondholders $863,453,142
more than the Government owes on the bonds.
Can the mode ot adjusting and paying off
these bonds I have suggested be conscientiously
objected to ? Suppose there were similar trans-
actions between individuals ? Suppose a man
was to loan $100,000 of greenbacks, and take
a note for $100,000 bearing six per cent, inter-
est, and when the note fell due the obligor
refused to pay, and he was sued in court. In
court he set up that there was usury in the
transaction, and upon his proving that his note
was sold for a depreciated currency, the gold
value of which was but fifty cents in the dollar,
any chancellor in England or in the United
States would liquidate the debt upon allowing
the obligee fifty cents in the dollar gold value
upon his note, and six per cent, on that fifty
cents of gold value. That cannot be denied,
and I shall presently read authorities to sustain
that position. My proposition is that it is just
and right between the bondholders and the
Government that the bondholders should re-
ceive for their bonds the value in gold that they
paid for them, and the interest in gold upon the
gold value of what they did pay for them. What
does the law say about usury ? I read first from
an authority abroad:
"Every shift, device, or subterfuge which the in-
genuity of man can invent to take unlawful inter-
est, either directly or indirectly, or by any shift or
deceitful way or means, is included in the provision
of the statute against usury. Neither are jases of
usury confined to precise loans of money ; but they
extend to cases where the relation of debtor and
creditor exists, and to cases where that relationship
subsists by the sale of wares, merchandise, and com-
modities."—1 Schoales anil Le Froy, 192.
Now I come to American authorities:
" Where, upon application for the loan of money,
it is by the agreement made a condition of the loan
that the borrower shall receive from the lender uncur-
rent bills ata higher rate than their value in cash or
current funds, the loan is usurious."—Cleaveland vs.
Lodar, 7 Paige, 557.
"Anote payable in dollars for nominal amount
of loan in Commonwealth's bank notes is usurious,
and relief will be granted to the extent of the usury,
which is ascertained by the value in gold and silver
of the notesloaned at the timeof the loan, and com-
puting interest at the legal rato, upon that value,
the difference being the usury." 4 J.J. M<n huU,
48; 2 Dana, 225; 1 J. J. Marshall, 49; 1 Johnson'*
Chancery Reports, 193; 2 Johnson's Chancery Reports,
537.
" Where there is usury, it extends to the first obli-
gation, it extends to all subsequent ones which com-
prehend and continue the matter of the lir?t; and
the obligor is entitled to the same relief against the
assignee or remote obligee as againstthe immediate
one." Campbell vs. Gill; 1 J. J. Marshall, 89.
These are all familiar principles of law which
no lawyer will controvert.
If ray proposition shall be voted down, as it
will be, I shall then propose to amend the bill
by striking out all after the enacting clause and
inserting in lieu of the words stricken out—
That for the purpose of ascertaining the proper
measure of liability of the United States on their
outstanding bonds, any holder or holders of said
bonds may, and hereby are, authorized to institute
suit orsuits, severally, or jointly and severally, upon
said bonds, or any numberof them, against the Uni-
ted States in the courts thereof.
The object of that proposition would be to
bring the matter to the test of the courts, to
the test of borrowing and lending, of debtor
and creditor, that could be executed by any
court in the United States as between individ-
uals. It seems to me that if the Government
of the United States settles its debts and its
liabilities upon the same principles of equity
and right which would be administered in a
court of chancery and couscieuce between
