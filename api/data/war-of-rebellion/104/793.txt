NASHVILLE, May 15, 1865.

Brigadier General H. M. JUDAH,

Kingston, Ga.:

Your communication of 10th inclosing correspondence with rebel General B. J. Hill received. The major-general commanding thinks you had better receive his surrender at Rome or Calhoun, as it is desirable to keep them as far south as possible.

WM. D. WHIPPLE,

Brigadier-General.

NASHVILLE, May 15, 1865.

Receive the troops of General Johnston's army at Greeneville. Furnish them with rations and transportation in direction of their homes as far as they can be carried by military railroad. Let Govan's brigade wait until you can receive telegraph message that a steam-boat is here ready to take them to Arkansas. How many do they number?

General Palmer reports that General Govan, with a brigade of Arkansas and Texas troops, numbering about 1,000, are one day's march behind him. General Palmer has rations to last him until Wednesday.
