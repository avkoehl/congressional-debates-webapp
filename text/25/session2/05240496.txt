States, and for other purposes, leporteá the samff, and recom
mended a concurtence therein
Mr PIERCE, though friendly to an increase of the army,
was decidedly opposed to some of the provisions oí the bill, and
addressed the Senate at some length, denouncing them as in
viduous, unequal, and unjust to officers in the line, and partial
to those of the stafF
Mr CRITTENDEN also spoke against the piovtsions, and
said that the only way to arrest theae abuses was to reject the
bill itself, which had better be altogether lost than (hat such
m.ustiee should be done He enumerated at length those
abuses which ippeared to him to be most glaring m their
eiTeets
Mr BENTON explained the merits of the bill, and contend
ed that while it boie on its face a great appat-ent increase of ex
penditure, it would, m fact, be a means of saving to the Go
vei nment,
The question having been taken on concurring m the amend
ment of the House of Representatives, it was carried m the
affirmative, when
Mr BENTON obtained leave, by unanimous consent, to
bring in a supplemental bill, which was lead, md ordered to a
second leading, as follows

Mt WRIGHT then moved that the Striate pioceed to con
mdei the amendment of the Ilou&e to the bill to modify the last
clause oí the fifth section of the deposite act of the 23d June,
1836 when
¡r*Mi WEBSTER said be should concui most readily m this
amen Inient of th' Mouse It gave him the uuest pleasun to
leant that the House had rtjected ihestcond st cttnn of the bill,
and that it ha i done so by t>o decisive a mijonty The House
had thus arrested the surrender oí all control o\tr the publi
Treasuie to the Executive It had interposed its two high au
thorny ma most constitutional and balutary manner, a manner
highly becoming the representatives of a ha. people I or all
this (said Mr W) I feci highly e;iatefui and at thin result, I
think, the wholt country may be justly congratulated
Mr MMiVIJI rose to express hia dnsent to the motion to
concui with the House of Representatives m striking out the
Recond su tionof (he hil! He could not consent to give a vote
which implied the opinion that the local banks, over which this
Government had no control, ought to be the depositories of it1*
moneys and of the levenues of the nation, and on that question
he asked the yeas and nays
Mi  N afterwaids withdrew the call
Mr PRESTON renewed the call for the yeas and nays He
desired to lecoid his own vote at leaston so important a mea
sure
Mr CLA\ said, though he had not obtained all that was de
tiled he should vote most cordially an 1 heaittly fot the amend
merit Without it or at least m the shape the bill was sent
fiom the Senate, it íeft all to Executive discretion, but as it
then was, it gave some semblance of legal control over the

The bill legulating the pay and emoluments of brevet of
ficen* was read ¿ thud íme, and on the ejuestion, shall this bill
pas*
Mr BUCHANAN f-aid that he had as high an opinion of the
merits of Gen Jones as anv man could have, and that if the
Senattr from feouth Carolina who had thehill under his chaige,
would consent that the bill should so amended that Gen Jones
sho ild receive brevet pay from and after the passageof the act,
it ahould jereive his support, but he had td idea of giving it a
ie trospec tivebeaimg
M SEVIER "aid thev had defeated a hill in the Sena e the
other «ay m relation to the same matte* giving brevet pay to
Gen Mecomb He thought both bills should share the same
late, and he, therefore, should move its indefinite postpone
ment
Some explanations having been given by Mr PRESTON,
the motion for indefinite postponement was withdrawn
Mr P went into a long explanation of the services of Gen
Jones, and the claims his gallantry liad upon his country     He
said however thathe would not object to the suggestion of the
Senator from Per nsylvama an^Stheold principle that halfa
loa wai bf tcr than no bread
Mr LY ON re lewed the motion foi indefinite postponement j
and the question was taken by yeas and nays, and lo-),J H '

The bill was then passed by a rote of 21 yeas, to 16 nay 
On motion of Mr CXAY, of Alabama^ the title of the bill

r^ORTHEASTERN BOUNDARY
Mr BUCHANAN, from the Committee on Foreign Rcia
tions, piesented arepoit, from that committee, of considerable
length, m which they unanimously íecommend to the Senate
the adoption of the following resolutions
Jipsolved, That after a cueful examination aad deliberate
consideration of the whole controversy between the United
States and Gieat Britain relative to the Northeastern boundary
of the foi mer, the Senate does not entertain a doubtof the en
tire practicability of running and marking that boundary in
strict conformity with the stipulations of the definitive treaty of
peace oí seventeen hundred and eighty three, and entertain
a perfect conviction of the justice and validity of the title of
the United States to the full extent of all the territory m dispute
between the two powers
Resolved, further) That, consideung that more than halfa
centuiy has elapsed since the conclusion of that maty consi
denn£ the extraordinary delay which has hitherto maiked the
negotiations and proceedings of the Governments ol the two
countiies, in then endeavor amicably to settle thecotnroveisy,
and consideung the danger of mutual in nation and collisions
upon the bordei of kindred and friendly nations from further
piocrasunation, the Senate cannot foibear to expiess art ear
nest desire that the pending negotiation should be brought to a
close, and the final decision oi the dispute be made as early as
practicable
Resolved, That, as it would be inexpedient for the United
Sutes i  proceed, upon their separate authority, to survey and
muk the Noitheastern boundary, until all reasonable means
oí effecting that object by the consent and concmrence of both
parties shall hive been exhaused, toe u bill to provide for sur-
veying the Noitheastern boundaiy Hue of the United Stateh
according to the treity of seventeen hundred and eighty three"
ought not to pass, and it is therefore ordered that ltbe laid upon
the table
Mr CLAY, of Ky lose to say that he had been \ try anxious
that the repoitshould be read and weighed with all the atten
uon and consideration belong ng to so grave and impoitant a
subject, that he should take the opportunity to say, while he
was up, that the question had bee most deliberately and caie
fully examined m the committee, that the report, which wa-3
the work of the Chan man, was prepared with very gieat
abdity, that much labor had been devoted to it, m theshou apace
that had been allowed, and which was the more creditable, to
its authoi amid his other vanous and piessmg duties, and
that it was v  ell calculated to advance his high character befoia
the counliy
He was anxious he said, to take the sense of the senate upon
the subject of the resolutions which were recommenoee, wth
as little delay as was possible
Mr TALLMADGE followed, and observed that, as a mem
btrof the Committee on foieign Kelations, he had ca'eiullv
and attentively examined the subject oí the íeport, and thai, h
concurred entncly with the Senator lrom Kentucky as to tin
talent and ability with which it wabdiawn up, and the mannti
in which it presented the great question If, unhappily, ¡said
Mi T at any tune hereafter any í olhsion hbould ai i e betw pen
the two countries, which he hoped most sincerely would be
avoided, it was very important, in his view, that the people ol
the country should understand the meuts of the conuoversy
They weie set forth in that report in a condensed, and dt the
same time, sufficiently complete and ample manner to enable
them fully to comprehend and understand it The report
ought, therefoie, to be widely and extensively cnculated I'
was calculated to unite and concerníate the sentiment of the
eountiy, if that occasion, which he earnestly diprecated, should
ever ari^e He should, therefoie, move for the priming of an
extra number of copies, the laigest that should be thought
proper, and he therefore moved f - the printing of 10,000 exua
copies, which, afterwards, at the suggestion of Mr WIL
LIAM* , supported by other gentlemen, he mereced to ¿0 000
Mr RIVES also expressed h s cordial and entire concurrence
m theiem irks which had bt-en m ia by his <ol lagui  on the
committee The íeport was drawn with distinguished ahih'y,
clearness, and force The argument on both side*- was iairly
repiesented, and (he paper would compare, to gieat advantage,
with whatever had bet n written, that he bad seen, upon theeub
ject It was vciy important that the menH of the question
should be made familiar to the Amu i cm mind, and no docu
ment, he conceived, was bettei t alculated to enlighten and con
duct it to sound conclusions He should vote the efore, with
the greatest pleasure, for the number of copies proposed by the
gentleman from New Yiuk, and for the highest numbei, indeed,
any Senator might deem it expe bent to have published
Mi WILLIAMS) said The gieat importance of the question,
and the able manner m which it wa  treated, and out right
maintained m the report now made, induce me to desne that a
larger number than that proposed by the Senator from New
"Vorkshjuld be printed Eveiy one must see that impoitant
íesults may grow out of therepuitand íesolutionsnowauopted,
and it is very desirable that as man/ of oui citueiib asean be
inducedto look at the question, «should have the mea is at hand
oí understanding it, anuoi beme convinced that we are claimn g
om right and nothing more This íepoit coming iiom the
Committee on Foreign Rel itions, and fiom Senators po'se^smg
the coníl lence oí the nation, must tarry conviction to the mind
of every man who williead it, and, therefoie, I would a~k that
twenty thousand ct pies may be oidered to be printed
Mr ALLEN said Ibhali vote foi the printing of the largest
number of tins rei ort It cannot be disguised that this contro
versy has already assumed a very imposing aspect, so much
so, indeed, ds to render it more than possible that the unued
energies of this people may be requued in its fuone adjust
mint, and yet m exclusively loca* has the question been
hitherto considerad, that its discission hat, excited ub ¡c at
tention m no other quaitei of the Union thdii that ri^ie imme
diately interested m it It has not, tbereiore, a-s yet, penetrated
the interior of the country, oi caught the attention of the great
body oí the American people This stitt o! ti mgs can no
longer exist The controvetsy has now taken a iorm that m ast
interest, in this settlement, eveiy citizen ot the Republic
I have heard, with deep attention, the ditcussion m the Se
nate, and I can sincerely declare, that, m my judgment, no pro
position was ever more free from embaí raesment, or title better
