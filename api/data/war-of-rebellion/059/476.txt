BULL'S GAP, April 24, 1864.

Major-General SCHOFIELD,

Knoxville:

Manson got off promptly at daybreak this morning. The cavalry are ordered to make 30 miles a day, and the infantry 20. All have five days' rations and forage. The instructions for their guidance in different contingencies I made out fully as you directed. The news brought in by scouts makes me confident of success for the expedition, there being no rebel force sufficient to meet them this side of Holston.

J. D. COX,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

KNOXVILLE, TENN.,

April 24, 1864.

Brigadier-General COX:

Your dispatch is received. As indicated in my second dispatch, Reilly's brigade will have to finish its work to-morrow. Manson's may be able to remain longer, but not much. Hascall's will not go as far as Bull's Gap unless he learns that you need his assistance.

If you have reason to apprehend an attack send for him; he was ordered to march to Morristown this evening.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

BULL'S GAP, April 24, 1864.

Major-General SCHOFIELD,

Knoxville:

Yours of this day received. Please let me know how much time ought to be used on the work ordered, so that if it cannot be done continuously through the whole distance we can scatter it at proper intervals. Shall I leave here before Hascall arrives, or wait for him?

J. D. COX,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

KNOXVILLE, TENN.,

April 24, 1864.

Brigadier-General COX,

Bull's Gap:

Later orders from General Sherman require greater expedition than I at first supposed. Do all you can on the railroad to-morrow, and be prepared to march the next day. Let the cavalry go on as before ordered. Let Manson's brigade do its work to-morrow, and return the next day, unless the cavalry shall need its support. Send your sick and baggage to Knoxville by rail as far as practicable. Tools will be sent up to-night. Do not forget the Lick Creek bridge.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.
