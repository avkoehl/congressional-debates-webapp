HDQRS. FIRST DIVISION, DISTRICT OF THE OHIO,Tuscumbia, Ala., July 23, 1862.

Major-General BUELL, Hunsville:

I am ready to cross the river at once if General Morgan was here. He is expected here to-morrow; left Iuka at a.m. to-day. I cannot follow your instructions without abandoning this place and the railroad.

General Schoepf crossed the river this morning at Decatur. Cannot he go to Pulaski with his brigade?

Only one battalion of cavalry here, the remainder guarding the road at other points until relieved. Can cross one brigade here to-morrow; the other probably the day following, with the cavalry and artillery.

Stockades have been ordered built, and all or most of them, I believe, completed. Will telegraph you in regard to rations as soon as I can hear from General McPherson.

Brigadier-General McPHERSON, Corinth:

Please inform me whether you can send rations to Decatur for General Buell, as he is very much in want of them. I will inform him as soon as I hear from you, and Captain Darr will make requisition on Captain Hawkins.

Major-General BUELL,

Huntsville, Ala:

Captain Darr arrived here at 10 o'clock to-day. Supplies might be got to Huntsville by steamers as far as Florence; wagon trains from Florence to Athens and thence by railroad to Huntsville. The Memphis and Charleston Railroad can be depended upon if they ever get serviceable engines and will run the road with any kind of system. Will write by Captain Darr.

TUSCUMBIA, July 23, 1862.

Major-General BUELL:

The troops at Iuka will commence crossing to-morrow, and part of my troops next will cross if the steamer gets up. I will get the whole across as soon as the troops to relieve me arrive. They are on the way. The first brigade, General Schoepf, left at 1 o'clock this morning for Decatur.

GEO. H. THOMAS.
