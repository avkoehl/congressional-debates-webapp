to be prepared to raise them promptly by any lawful means to which we may deem it necessary to resort.

Very respectfully,

Attorney-General of Iowa.

[Indorsement.]

WAR DEPARTMENT,

September 23, 1861.

Respectfully referred to Adjutant-General Thomas, with request to reply by letter and send copies of laws and general orders. I think all the Governors should be supplied with full sets of general issued in 1861. Drafting should not be resorted to as yet in any of the States.

THOMAS A. SCOTT,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

BURLINGTON, IOWA, September 16, 1861.

SECRETARY OF WAR:

SIR: Iowa has now twelve regiments in the field, a larger number than any other State in proportion to her population. Their snow better material for soldiers in the world. A call is now made on her through her Governor for four more regiments, making sixteen. We can raise them if the men can make provision for the support of their families whilst they may be absent. Adopt the allotment ticket system as in the Navy, and as authorized by the recent act of Congress, and you can have 4,000 better men, if it be possible, than any yet enlisted. It should be done at once and notice given of it.

Your obedient servant,

JAMES W. GRIMES.

AUGUSTA, ME., September 16, 1861.

Honorable SIMON CAMERON,

Secretary of War:

Shall our next regiment go to Long Island? where can it get arms?

I. WASHBURN, JR.,

Governor.

Governor WASHBURN,

Augusta, Me.:

Send to Washington, with orders to report to General McClellan for arms.

AUGUSTIN BLAIR,

Governor of Michigan, Lansing:

We intend that you shall use your discretion in forwarding all regiments, and put them in such shape as to be serviceable.

SIMON CAMERON,

Secretary of War.
