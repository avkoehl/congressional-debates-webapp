Treasury Department, Register's Office, January 30,1868.
N. L. JEFFRIES, Acting Rooster.
I have taken pains to ascertain the rate of
taxation in the city of Washington; and
Mayor Waliach furnishes tne with the follow-
ing facts:
"1. The rate of taxation for all purposes on real
estate in Washington from 1860 to 1867 was about one
per cent., or one dollar on the hundred.
"2 The assessed taxable value is supposed to be
about two thirds of its real value.
3. The assessed value of real estate compared with
sales made in 1867 presents a difference of quite fifty
per cent, in favor of sale."
The collector of taxes states that the amount
of assessed value of real and personal property
in Washington city is as follows for the years
indicated:
Year Heal and Personal.
1864 $38,835,886
1865...   40,106,736
18(36   41,203,636
1867   42,483,536
He also states the following in reference to
the rate of taxation in Washington :
Hale of Taxation
oil each 6100 of Rate of
Year. property. Taxation.
185 9 $0.60 $0,006
186 0  0.65 .0065
186 1  0.50 .0050
186 2 0.75 .0075
1863  0.75 .0075
1864... 1.10 .011
186 5 1.00 .01
186 6  1.10 .011
1867 1.25 .0125
It will be seen from these statements that
there is no city in the United States where the
taxes are so light as they are in this. The rate
of tax here is less than six mills on the actual
value of the property assessed for taxation.
And notwithstanding this we are now asked to
tax our people still further than they are now
taxed to pay for the local expenses of this
city.
[Here the hammer fell.]
Mr. WASHBUIINE, of Illinois. I am
obliged to the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Law-
rence] for the interesting statement he has just
given to us. Iliope to have his earnest support,
as I have not had it to the fullest extent to-day',
to reduce the appropriations for this city. His
statement will be useful when we come to them
furtheron. I should not be displeased if the gen-
tleman should convince the committee that it is
very proper to strike out this appropriation foi
the Metropolitan police. In putting the appro-
priation in the bill the Committee on Appro-
priations has only followed the law. If gen-
tlemen will look at page 193 of the estimates
they will find how this amount is made up.
The Government pays two thirds of the expense
