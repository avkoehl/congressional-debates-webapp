HEADQUARTERS,Crab Orchard, November 5, 1861.

Brigadier General W. T. SHERMAN,

Commanding Department of the Cumberland, Louisville, Ky.

GENERAL: * * * I inclose copies of two communications I have just received from Mr. William B. Carter, the brother of Lieutenant Carter, U. S. Navy. * If we could possibly get the arms and the four regiments of disciplined and reliable men we could seize the railroad yet. Cannot General McClellan be induced to send me the regiments? He can spare them easily I should think.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Brigadier-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY,Washington, November 7, 1861.

Brigadier General D. C. BUELL.

GENERAL: * * * So much in regard to political considerations. The military problem would be a simple one could it be entirely separated from political influnces. Such is not the case. Were the population among which you are to operate wholly or generally hostile it is probable that Nashville should be your first and principal objective point. It so happens that a large majority of the inhabitants of Eastern Tennessee are in favor of the Union. It therefore seems proper that you should remain of the defensive on the line from Louisville to Nashville while you throw the mass of your forces by rapid marches by Cumberland Gap or Walker's Gap on Knoxville in order to occupy the railroad at that point and thus enable the loyal citizens of Eastern Tennessee to rise while you at the same time cut off the railway communication between Eastern Virginia and the Mississippi. It will be prudent to fortify the pass before leaving it in you rear.

[GEO. B. McCLELLAN.]
HEADQUARTERS,Crab Orchard, November 7, 1861.

Governor ANDREW JOHNSON, London, Ky.

DEAR SIR: Your favor of the 6th instant is at hand. + I have done all in my power to get troops and transportation and means to advance into Tennessee. I believe General Sherman has done the same. Up to this time we have been unsuccessful. * * * If the Tennesseeans are not content and must go then the risk of disaster will remain with them. Some of our troops are not yet clothed and it seems impossible to get clothing.

* * * * * * *

Very respectfully and truly, yours,

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Brigadier-General, U. S. Volunteers.
