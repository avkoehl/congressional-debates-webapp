HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF WEST MISSISSIPPI,New Orleans, February 20, 1865.

Brigadier General JAMES C. VEATCH, U. S. Volunteers:

GENERAL: The commanding general directs that one more of the Arkansas regiments (besides the three mentioned in my communication of yesterday) be held in readiness to leave this afternoon by the steamer Corinthian, and the balance (two regiments) to leave by the steamer Belvidere to-morrow. Both these steamers will go to Dauphin Island by sea, and the commanding general desires that yourself and staff proceed by the Belvidere. It is highly important that no delays should occur in the movements of these troops, and requisitions for supplies should therefore instantly be made out and filled. The chiefs of the staff departments are prepared to respond without delay. If any of these regiments have made arrangements for payments, paymasters will be sent after them to Mobile Bay to complete the arrangements, but the troops will not be allowed to delay their departure from Algiers on that account.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. T. CHRISTENSEN,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General.
