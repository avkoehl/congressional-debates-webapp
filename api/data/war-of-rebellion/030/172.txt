Brigadier-General BOYLE, Louisville:

Our information is against that position for Forrest, but caution is the parent of safety. Caution General Granger; I don't wish him to be caught again, nor whipped out of his boots by marauders.

CAMP HAMILTON, December 13, 1862-1 p.m.

Colonel J. P. GARESCHE, Chief of Staff:

Two of my scouts return with following:They penetrated within 4 miles of Triune, on south side, when they encountered heavy pickets. Buckner was at Triune with 12,000; a heavy rebel force extending from Triune to Murfreesborough; Polk's and Morgan's commands on Murfreesborough and Lebanon pike, Humphrey Marshall reported with them; General Forrest's brigade of cavalry returned to Columbia. Rebels evince a spirit of determination, officers saying they intend to contest an advance. I give this talk for what it is worth. The scouts were fired at in passing through their pickets this morning.
