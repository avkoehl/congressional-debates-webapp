HEADQUARTERS POLK'S CORPS,Henderson's House, September 19, 1863-9 a.m.

Lieutenant General D. H. HILL:

GENERAL: General Polk directs me to notify you that General Armstrong has been ordered to retire from his left and move to the right flank of the army. This leaves the space between his left and your right unoccupied. The general suggests, respectfully, that you should at once close up this space by moving to his left, and particularly that you should relieve the pickets of Armstrong as speedily as possible with Breckinridge's pickets, upon the line of the Chickamauga.

Respectfully, general, your obedient servant,

[THOS. M. JACK.]

Assistant Adjutant-General.

COLONEL: I have just learned that General Hill intends to withdraw Breckinridge from Glass' Mill this morning. If so, I would suggest that he be withdrawn at a crossing as low down as may be found practicable, in order to cover my left, which would otherwise be exposed, there being several crossings between my left and what is called the Glass' Mill road.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
