General BENHAM:

The train of eighteen boats is needed to cross the army over the Appomattox. This is the train I alluded to.

ALEX. S. WEBB,

Brevet Major-General and Chief of Staff.

ROANOKE STATION, April 30, 1865.

Major General A. S. WEBB,

Chief of Staff:

Your orders to move just received. Major Van Brocklin placed one pontoon bridge eight miles below this at Moseley's Ferry yesterday for General Sheridan, and I presume he has been taken on with him. The bridge which reached me on Friday is now down near the railroad, the bridge of which road I expect will be completed, or nearly so, to-morrow. The pontoon bridge I now have down will, I think, be very useful for General Wright's command, if his wagons are to return by this route; but unless I hear otherwise I shall presume it is wished that the bridge shall be taken up at once, and shall so order. While writing the last words I have your second telegram, and will order the bridge to be taken up and to start to-night. Perhaps the general will think it best if Vana Brocklin can be reached that he should be kept with his bridge for General Wright.

H. W. BENHAM,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

ROANOKE STATION, April 30, 1865-5.25 p.m.

Major-General WEBB,

Chief of Staff:

I have just learned that General Sheridan has passed, ordering Van Brocklin to report to me. His bridge, the longest one at Moseley's Ferry, I will order to be taken up at once, and to march on to-night. Folwell's I propose to retain till I start and then to leave it for General Wright, if I am so authorized.

H. W. BENHAM,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,April 30, 1865-6.20 p.m.

Brigadier-General BENHAAM,

Roanoke Station:

Obey the order to send the bridge with you-Folwell's-at once. Do not wait for any other. The order is explicit. Send the bridge sent with General Gibbon to this point at once.

ALEX. S. WEBB,

Brevet Major-General and Chief of Staff.
