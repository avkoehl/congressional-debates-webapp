This will be done on the prescribed muster-in rolls (muster and descriptive roll of recruits). These rolls will be made out from the re-enlistments and descriptive lists of the men. (See section 4 of this paragraph.) The following remark will be made on the muster-in rolls, over the signature of the commissary or assistant commissary of musters: "Remustered from six-months" service for three years or the war, under authority from the War Department, 1863."

6. Regimental, battalion, or company commanders, under the direction of their immediate superior commanders, will select and appoint a recruiting officer for their respective commands, and charge him with their re-enlistment of the men thereof. The re- enlistments will be made in duplicate, and on the blank for "Volunteer enlistment." A descriptive roll of the men will be made out at the same time. The duplicate re-enlistments and descriptive roll will be forwarded or taken by the recruiting officer to the commissary or assistant commissary of musters who may be in charge of the musters for the organization to which the men belong. The mustering officer will countersign the re- enlistment papers and file the descriptive roll with the records of his office. One copy of the re-enlistment will be delivered by the mustering officer to the paymaster to assist him in the examination and verification of the accounts; this copy will be forwarded with the said accounts to the proper accounting officer of the Treasury. The second copy of the re-enlistment will be returned by the mustering officer to the regimental commander, and by him forwarded to the Adjutant-General of the Army with the monthly recruiting return required by paragraph 919, Army Regulations, from superintendents of regimental recruiting service.
