General Gordon sends the following information, received through a deserter from the Twenty-fourth Virginia Cavalry, who reports that the position which he occupied at Weldon afforded him a good opportunity to observe the amount of supplies passing through that place, the sources from whence they came, and their final destination: All of forage for General Lee's army passes through Weldon. It is brought there on the Seaboard, Raleigh and Gaston, and Weldon and Wilmington Railroads. Forage very scarce. All sugar and coffee lately issued to General Lee's army has been carried through Weldon, and most of it came via Murfree's Depot. Four hundred bales of cotton stored in Weldon when informant left. Cotton seized by Confederate Government is turned over to commissary of subsistence, who appoints agents to carry into our lines and dispose of it.
