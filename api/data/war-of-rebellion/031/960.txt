Lieutenant-Colonel WHIPPLE,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Baltimore:

I forward the papers to you to-day in regard to General Milroy. It will not do to leave Cluseret in command at Winchester. May I suggest to the general commanding that if General Lockwood was ordered to Winchester, Milroy might be permitted to go? Not otherwise, safely.

Brigadier General E. P. SCAMMON, Fayetteville:

Your dispatch, addressed to the commanding general in regard to forces at you front, received. Communicate with General Crook in relation to sending an expedition to cut the railroad, if you think this can be done. Make inquiries as to what forces are at mouth of New River, and report this, and also whether you and Crook together can form any plan for an expedition. If the railroad can be cut, it is, of course, very desirable to have it done.
