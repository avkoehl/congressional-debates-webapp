APPENÜIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

26th Cong.- "2nd Sess.
is all very fine, it sounds well and may succeed, it
it is at least plausible, but will not bear much scru-
tiny- It is not a mere question of a tax on wmes
and  ilks There is much more in it than at first
meets the eye. I cannot but regard the preposi-
tion as designed to spring a tariff on us before We
are aware of our danger; and I think so, notwith-
standing the many disclaimers that we have heard
over the way. Sir, one would almost conclude
there were no tariff men in this House—'judicious
tariff-—moderate tariff—just tariff," is all they
want; but what would be just, moderate, and judi-
cious, is about as hard to find out as is the delicien
cy m the Treasury. It might vary, like that, from
7 to 40 per cent. All these disclaimers come too
from tariff men, and if they were cross-examined a
little as to their understanding of the compromise
act, the end and object of Ihis movement would
perhaps be put "in a clear point of view " Sir,we
have nothing to fear from an open tariff question
Presidential aspirations will prevent that It is
against a high tariff for protection m disguise that
we must guard, for here lies the danger. But I do
not intend to ge into the question of laying a tax
on wines and silks. My colleague has done that in
a much abler manner than I can, and, as I intend
circulating his speech, it is unnecessary.
As my time for speaking is limited by the rule
adopjed this morning, which takes this bill out of
the committee m some twenty or thirty minutes, I
must avoid a regular batt'e, and be content to fire
a few random shot, intending to write out what I
have no chance of speaking here This much,
however, let me say, that ihe question is an impor-
tant one, demanding more consideration than it
can receive during the present secsion of Congress,
if the whole time were appropriated to the «ubject
If increased taxation is necessary, take up the
whole question of the tariff, consult all sections
and interests, and act openly and deliberately Let
us know what you are about, and let your legisla-
tion be general, not partial. Why this haste?
Month's will elapse,"if you adopt the motion, before
the duties will commence—not until October next—
too late entirely to relieve your Treasury of its pre-
sent embarrassments I have no objection to tax
Iwnmes, if you will relieve necessidej from taxa-
tion I will go with you to tax the rich man's
silk garment?, if you will go with me to take off
your enormous tax on the poor man's blanket and
coarse woollens and cottons I will tax wine if
you will take off your tax on salt I have no ob-
jection to imposing a moderate duty on silks and
wines for the purposes of revenue, but I have no
idea, as a Southern man, to stand by quietly, and
see luxuries for which we exchange our produce
heavily taxed, while those exchanged for Northern
manufactures come in free of daty I do not want
to force a poor man's wife to give up her silk
gown, and compel her to wear coarse Northern cot
tons at ihe same price Why not tax your spices,,
dye-stuffs, teas, mahogany, &c as well as wmes
and silks? But ihe cry i*, the Treasury it, empty
and how are we to supply the deficiency' Sir, 1
would advise you, instead of doing this, bj mcreas

and reform, to practise what we have se zealously
proposed I would say to Gen Harrison, as a
friend, study this book, (holding up the blue tcok )
I would advise him to act on the precep's con-
tained in the speeches of the gentlemen from Ohio,
(Mr Bosrn,) from Pennsylvania, (Mr Ogle,) and
others of our party, which inculcate reform Let
him abolish all useless offices By a judicious
reform in New York alone, from 500,000 to

the revenue, the cost of collection in a few years

show, when plain structures will answer every pur-
pose.
Reduce the contingent expenses of Congress and
the Executive Departments.
Cut down your overgrown civil list, both at home
and abroad.
Look into the administration of the military and
navy departments, your commissaries, contractors,
and the vast number of agencies over the country,
enough here may be saved, by judicious manage
meat, to terminate the Florida war without further
draughts on your empty coffers
Modify or repeal your bounties and drawbacks,
which take hundreds of thousands from the Trea
sury to no useful purpose, and which, m many
cases, have become crying abire.;
Revise your pension systt m, for it is connected
with enormous frauds, and has been pushed by
Congress far beyond the hmitb of justice and pro-
priety
The gentleman from North Carolina [Mr
Raynek] read us a wholesome lecture on economy
and frugality, but, strange lo say, labored hard to
persuade u-> into the notion of an extra session,
which would of itself cost the country some four
hundred thousand dollars for pay and expenses of
Congress This is practising what you preach with
a vengeance' To begin your system of retrench-
ment by incurring an unnecessary expense of four
hundred thousand dollars, when the gentleman
himself admits that our funds are exhausted, and
that we should bonow the very money to carry it
through It may be, sir, very practical economy in
North Carolina, but does not square with our "ab
stract" notions in Virginia
Pursue, then, I say, a vigorous system of re-
trenchment and there can be no doubt tint Gen
Harrison will soon save money enough to pay all
the debts of this Govern nent Mr Adams ave
raged about thirteen millions per annum for per-
manent and extrarrdmary expenlttuns, and the
great interests of the tountry were in quite as
flourishing a condition as when we expended
thirty or forty millions It is not so much the
amount of appropriations, as the manner of t'is
bursing them, lhat does good to the country I
found iault with the manner as well as the amount
under Mr Van Buren, though some of our Whig
fnendb now do not seem to regard the amount as
so enormous, and argue a« if twenty million- per
annum was not enough I repeat, sir, the decla-
lation that, with a careful adminisiration of the
civil, naval, and military departments, and that
of Indian affairs, such a retrenchment may be car
ried out, with >ut the passage of a single law, as
will enable us to pass through the present year
without serious difficulty or embarrassment
But, at the same tim that th  cry of deficiency'
deficiency1 is sounded in this Hall, and comes buck
to vn from all parts of our widely extended country
— tt the same time that the proposition is pending
in this wing of the Capitol to increase the taxes and
burdens of our constituent*-, an eff rt is strenoonsly

mt us deb's at home in i abroad The corrupting
and injurious tendemy cf this distribution scheme,
the fatal blov it would inflict on the independence
of the States, making them "pi n íoneis on the
bounty" of the Federal Go/eminent, is so happilv-
illustrated in the «peecu of my colleague that I sha 1
«ay but little on the subject Whatever arguments
might be u*ed in favor of distribution w th abun-
dant resources, surely no man can, m the credent
state of our finances, for a moment entertain such
a thought, unless, through us instrumentality, he
seeks to inflict on us a high protective tariff Tney
ara parts of the same policy the adoption of one
as a necessary consequence, leads to the other A
loan is mtfndel i" the basis ot a national bank,
distribution of the proceeds of the public lands as
the entering wedge tor the assumption of State
debts, and a high tariff as providing the mears of
payment They all go hand m hand together, they
are links in the same chain of consolidation, and,
if not broken, will bury the sovereigntyof the States

H. of Reps.
The question of distribution at this <i me is a very
different one from former pr posit ons of this cha-
racter Now it is propo ed to take nearly one
quarter of the whole revenue of the United States
and give it 'o the several State', when lhat revenue
is admitted on all hands, especially by those who
are in favor of this scheme, to be inadequate to our
wants Whereas, when the subject was before un-
der consideration, the Treasury was burdened with
an enormous surplus, alike inconvenient to the Go-
vernment and dangerous to the well being of the
country Many, therefore, who approved it when
we had a "vicious surplus," may now, without in-
consistency, oppose it with a barren Treasury.
Conscious of the absurdity of "distributing a
deficiency," (as my colleague, Mr. Wist, properly
terms it,) and of the fatal objection to the propo-
sition to be drawn from a deficiency in the Trea-
sury, the advocates of the policy gravely maintain
lhat it is an assumption of power on our part to
use this money for the ordinary purpovesof Go-
vernment, and rely on the deeds of cession to the
United Stales m proof of their position But there
is no expression to be found in any of these in-
struments which warrant* this construction, and
certain I am, no man can be hardy enough to
maintain that it is in accordance with the spirit
and intent of the deeds, and that the parties thereto
contemplated at the time any such purpose. But
this argument has been blown to the winds, it is
utterly indefensible A  to the constitutional
power, I have but a smgle observation to make-
Can this Government derive power from any other
source than the Constitution? Can a Republican
of the State Rights school look tor power for the
Federal Government in any other quarter without
destroying the fundamental article of his creed? In
the conclusion of his eloquent address, the gentle-
man from North Carolina [Mi Raynek] endorsed
his old cre-d oí nullification Sir, I am glad to
1 hear him, claim still to be a nnlhfier, for, if the
doctrines of his speech be earned out by the in
coming Administration, it will mt be long, in my
humble judgment, before he wi'l again nave to re-
port tol nul ífication as the rightful remedy ' 1
listened to hii speech with much attention—it was
a handsome affair—but I must say, it was the b°st
tariff speech that has been made during the whole
debate
But I have another objection to the distribution
scheme of 'till greater force, representing, as I do,
the most important naval station in the United
Stites I believe a more fatal blow to the navy
could no be given than lo adopt this policy Once
begin the system, and you will find every effort
here in vain to obtain an appropriation for this
branch of your service adequate to its wants and
the exigenoiev of the country In toe «cramble

all well enough, it is an evidence of the great fa-
vor in which the navy Is held by the people, when
politicians are lavish in expressions of their attach
to l's interests, and of admiration for the heroic
achievements of its sons Daily ísitrunp m our
ears that the navy is neglected, that, compared
witn that of France, England, Russia, even with
Turkey and E¡ ypt, it is contemptible as to numeri-
cal force, and that, should war ensue with England,
our commerce must be swept from the ocean All
