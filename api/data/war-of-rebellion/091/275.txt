I have just returned from within four miles of Culpeper Court-House. There are no troops there or in that vicinity. They are making no preparations to advance in this direction. There are no troops at Gordonsville or it approaches, this side, except at Gordonsville a portion of a regiment guarding a recruiting camp for disabled horses, a provost guard conscripting, and a few conscripts. Early has been re-enforced by about 5,000 men sent forward with Longstreet, who has been sent to take command in the Valley; also Pickett's division and Rosser's brigade of cavalry.

COLONEL: I have the honor to report my return to this point this evening. I telegraphed the substance of what I had to report this morning from Catlett's Station. I omitted to say that one wood since Kershaw's division left Culpeper Court-House for Gordonsville,a nd a few days since left Gordonsville to join Early. It was his division which attacked us before near Culpeper Court-House. It had just come down from the Valley there the day previous to my arrival, and was on its way to join Lee at Richmond. I have this information from the Honorable John Minor Botts, at Brandy Station.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
