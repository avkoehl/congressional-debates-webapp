HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT Number 2,Tupelo, June 26, 1862.

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General:

GENERAL: I have to acknowledge the receipt of a telegraph dispatch from the Secretary of War, dated the 21st instant, touching the completion of the railroad connection between Meridian, Miss., and Selma, Ala. That connection is one of such vital military necessity, and so immediately affecting military operations in the department intrusted to me, that I feel it my duty to communicate frankly my views for the information and consideration of the department.

The papers accompanying,+ marked A, B, and C, will show conclusively how little the company, unfortunately invested with the privilege of completing this all important work, have done toward the execution of their contract. Since the passage of the act there has been ample time, under a vigorous management, for the construction of the railroad
