Seuate.
would be a w oik of some laboi, and w ithout it an
opportunity is not affoided to decide how large or
how small it> the amou it of the specalat on of those
who hold the residue of the stocks of these banks,
but it maj be safely assumed, that where a large
propoition of the capital stock of a bank has been
purchased in by the institution, there has been
gross mismanagement of its affairs It is impru-
dent for a bank having notes in circulation to own
oi loin largely on pledges of its own stock, aud it
ii indubitable, that large amounts of the stock of a
bank, skilfully conducted, would not be so far be-
low par that no purchaser could be found foi it,
when pledged to secure the payment of a loan at
six per cent   but th° bank itself
" From the tes'imon) ol a respectable broker, to
be found m the appendix, it appeals that the tack 
of two or these banks have hold as low as fltty per
cent below par
"There weie four banks in the District which sus-
pended specie payments m 1834, one of them the
Bank oí Alexandra, has not applied for a rechai-
tei, and consequently, no means have been taken
to ascertain the extent ol the depreciation of the
various obligations in the hands oí the holder At
the time of its failure, its capital wa, £,500,000, oí
■which jpll5,565 had been taktn by the bank in
payment ot debts lis notes in cuculation, its
public and pnvate deposites, amounted to #152,1G7
As this b ink Ins not j et scaled with the holders ol
lt^ obligations it c-mnot be said with celtunty how
much of this amount of piopirty has been lost to
the public, but we íeel w irranted m estimating
that it least sixty per cuit of it, sav §3jO,000,
may be added to the large sums heretofore named,
which have been taken irom the profits of laboi,
and been absorbed by advcnluiers and speculatois
in currency and Me-c s What amount ot the
stock or paper oí the other three banks which sus-
pended specie payments changed hands at a dis-
count cannot be slated fully It appears from the
testimony of several witnesses who have been ex-
amined, and whose testimony is appended to this
report, that laige amounts ol the stock and notesot
these three banks changed hands at a discount ol from
fifteen to sixty per cent Ami the committee íe-
grel to disunei that sevtial ot the directors, of
those institutions, some of whom had, by their own
acts, depreciiteci their obligiUons, enteicj the
maikct, and puiohised friely the '-tock indncles
of the banks ot which they weie lireclors, it i di
count, and then paid tht paper thus outlined into
the biuk at par in dischaige oí the debts due by
them thereto
"The extent of these and oiher speculations m the
currencj oi the four banks may be measitiaUly es-
timated, from the fact that they had in circulation
and in deposites, at the time of susprnsic n, six
hundred anil ninety-six thousand four bundled and
seventy one eloliars, more than one half of which
obligations, tigether with their stocks, changed
hands in sixty davs after the suspension, at an a\e-
rageofthirtj per cent discount to the original
holder A considerable propoition of the proiits ot
which operations were mide by the duectois of
those institutions, whose speculations were certain-
ly reprehensible, as they were largely indeuted to
the several b inks committed to their care, at the
time of their respective failures, and hid it in their
power, by pajing in current funds their own roles,
to have postponed, and, m all probability, to ha\e
prevented entirely those disastious speculations by
which they piofited so much while the community
suffered so senousl} "
Such, sir, appears to have been the conduct of
the four banks now asking for a recharter, which
stopped payment in 1834 By their ow n ac t, by
their gross mismanagement, it not fraudulent con-
duct, they dtprcciate the value of their stock, and
notes in cnculauon, and then go into the market,
and purchase in their slock for the benefit of the
institutions at a large disconn , and the notes are
in like manner bought up by the directors at a dis-
count, to pay their dc' ts to tnc bmks
And these opeiations ha/p not been to a ¡united
amount onl), it appears that the entire capital of
the seven banks was 3,279,629 dollars, and that
nearly one half oí the whole was purchased in or
pledged  to the banks in 1836,   that is to say,
1,464,37b dollars This amount of the stock of
t1 ese banks has been bougnt in at a discount in
soma instances of fifty per cent and we are now
called upon to recharter the institutions, and raise
it to its pir value What must be thought of a
bank which suspends payment and then bujs in its
own notes and stock1 By their o« n misconduct
they depreciate the value of their stock and notes,
and then take advantage of then own wrong The
directors and officers of these banks knew then real
condition, they knew the value of their notes and
stock, but no body else could know The stoppage
occasioned distrust and alarm, whether the bills
would ever be paid, or whether the stock would be
worth any thing, were questions «Inch no one but
thedaeetors and officers of the banks could decide,
and taking advantage of this secret knowledge,
they speculate m then own stock and bills at the
expense of the rest of the community Stock be
longing to widows and orphans was puichased up
in this way He could not trust himself to speik
of such conduct as he thought it deserved to be
eharacteuzed, as ne should have to ust languag 
«Inch he did no' wish to use Contiacts like thest,
it is well known, would be set aside in a court ot
equity as fraudu out and dishonest
Mr N said he would now call the att"nnon of
the Senate to the testimony in the repe rt m pioof

the bank, I so'd them again to individuals to pay

"I made frequent sales to the directors" [this wit-
ness, said Mr N appears to make a distinction
between officers and directors] "of the banks, at a
small profit Some was sold, I recollect, to Mr.
Ingle, a dnector of the Patriotic bank, Mr. Edward
Semmes, a dnector of the Batik of Washington,
William A Bradley, President of the Patriotic
Bank, Jonathan Prout, and Samuel J. Todd, direc-
tors in the Bank of Washington, and Raphael
Semmes, a director in the Farmeis and Mechanics
Bank of Georgetown I kept no recoids, I speak
only tiom recollection when our transactions were
veiy heavy To some of the above gentlemen I
se lit these notes, and took m payment their indi-
vidual notes, at long dates without interest I re-
collect that Mr Smith, President of the Farmers
and Mechanics Bank of Georgetown, and William
A Biadley, President of the Patriotic Bank, ofler-
cdto exchange bills and notes discounted, or pro-
pel ty of the bank, for any amount of their paper
that I might piocure In the transactions between
Mi Bradley and Mr Ingle, and myself, I thmk,
though I am not certain, that there was no money
pissed They gave me in exchange for Patriotic
Bank paper, scrip of the Chesapeake and Ohio
Canal Company, and due bills of the corporation
of Washington The scrip and the due bills were
selling at that time for about eighty-five cents on
th. dollar "
Mi N said he had had but little time to examine
this report, which he believed contained a mass
of information tending 'o show the mismanage-
ment of these banks in 1834 It he was not mis-
in ormed, it would appear in some part of the
report that the bills of some of these banks were
put into circulation after their suspension, and then
bought up by d rectors at a large discount
Mr N said, that m view of the conduct and
mismanagement of these banks in 1834, and their
piesent condition,he thought the better course would
be to extend their charters for one or two years, to
enable them to close up their concerns, and to esta-
blish such number of new banks as may be re-
quired for the wants of the District
On the motion of Mr Buchanan to amend the
bill so as to requne one dollar in specie for every
four dollars of circulation and deposites, instead of
cuculation alone, Mr Niles said the questisn raised
by the amendment rendered it necessary to examiae
the principle already contained in the bill, which
íequired a certain proportion of specie as the basis
of the cuculation. The soundness of this princi-
ple, and the reasons on which it rests, would, he
thought, go far to decide the question of the
amendmenf This principle is not only one of
great importance, but one about which there ts great
diversity of opinion This diversity of opinion is
not confined to those who essentially dissent m re-
gird to the paper system, it is not a difference of
opinion only between the ultra paper money men
and the ultia hard money men, but it prevails
among the opponents of the banking system There
are those, decidedly hostile to our existing banking
and paper s)stern, who íeel the full force of the
evils of our curiency, and describe them in the
strc ngest possible terms, who appear to look for a
remedy for these evils by breaking down the mono-
poly principle, and removing all restrictions They
propose to apply to banking, in their utmost lati-
tude, the principles of free irade The free trade
pnnciples he was not disposed to controvert, (al-
though he thought they had their limitations,) but
the question i*, how far are they applicable to bank-
ing so far as that consists in manufacturing or
coining monej, puttm  it into cuculation, and thus
supplying thp curiency of the country1*
Trade will regulate itself, and never flóunsfcea
well as when left open lo general competition, and
is free from all reduction But will the manufac-
ture and emission of money regulate itself, and
especially when it is only a form of credit, and of
no intrinsic value1 Money composed of gold and
silver, was it not for the facility oí a fraudulent
