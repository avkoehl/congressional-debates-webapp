Let me also, in this moment of compliance, suggest that Mr. John F. Scott, of Fredericksburg,, who was captured while performing the offices of mercy to a wounded Federal officer on the battle-field of Fredericksburg, be sent to us. If any case in this war could appeal for clemency it is his. He was arrested under the circumstances I have mentioned. He is, or was, in the Old Capitol Prison. I have not waited for your acquiescence to this request before I agreed to send the members of the Sanitary Commission to you. I send them because I am satisfied they have at one time or another done offices of mercy to our people.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

RO. OULD,

Agent of Exchange.
