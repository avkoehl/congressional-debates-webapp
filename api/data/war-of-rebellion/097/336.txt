HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,March 31, 1865-10.23 a. m.

(Received 10.28 a. m.)

Major-General WEBB,

At General Grant's Headquarters:

General Grant's dispatch to General Meade as to sparing no exertion in the execution of orders to get rations forward to Warren received. The chief quartermaster has given such instructions, and to take the rations on pack-mules if the train can't be got up.

GEO. D. RUGGLES,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

GRAVELLY RUN, March 31, 1865-11.50 a. m.

Major-General MEADE,

At Fifth Corps Headquarters:

Humphreys should not push to the front without a fair chance and full determination to go through.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,March 31, 1865-12 m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Generals Crawford and Ayres have been driven back on Griffin. Griffin is about to resume the offensive, supported by an attack of Hymphreys' left. Humphreys will withdraw from his right all he can spare to attack with Miles. Since the enemy are trying to turn our left I deem it important to attack with Sheridan and to let Ord assume the offensive if practicable.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.

GRAVELLY RUN, March 31, 1865.

(Received 12.40 p. m.)

Major-General MEADE:

It will take so long to communicate with Sheridan that he cannot be brought up in co-operation unless he comes up in obedience to orders sent him last night. I understood General Forsyth to say, however, that as soon as another division of cavalry got up he would push it forward with Merritt. It may be there now. I will send to him again at once. I will also direct Ord to keep the enemy busy in his front and go through if he can.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

BOYDTON PLANK ROAD, March 31, 1865-12.45 p. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Tell General Humphreys that Miles is driving the enemy. A brigade is moving out to support him and to push him; another is held in readiness to move out. Fire in front of Warren is receding.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
