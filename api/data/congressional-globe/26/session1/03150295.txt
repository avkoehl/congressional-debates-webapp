tan Iv present in the Hou^e and voted on that occa-1011, and vo
ted in the negative He asked permission 01 the House, there
fore, to have the journal corrected by the insertion ol his name
in the proper place
Mr CRAIG submitted to the gentleman whether it would not
he better to submit to this slight inconvenience than to set a
dangerous precedent It the omission had occurred only a day
or two ago, there woul 1 be no nicon>cnience in correcting the
journal but lie thou ht that goins «o far back to mike a corree
tion would be liable to serious objections

The *PE AKER stated that the first business in order was the
question on the appeal taken by the gentleman from New
York [Mr Barnard] from the decision of the Chair that the
petition presented by that gentleman on praying that Florida
should not be admitted into the Union so long as its < onstitu
lion tolerated the institution of slavery, came within the rule
in relation to Abolition petitions, and c >uld not be received
Mr ANDREWS said the time was when I e should hive
been pleased to have an opportu lty aftir led him to discuss the
question of Abolition, but as he was fully satisfied with thede
cisión «f the House upon tins subject, and asa discussion would
be very injurious to the public business, he moved the pre
viousquestioo on the appeal   which wasseconded, and
The main question having been ordered which was, "Shall
the decision of the Speaker stand as the judgment ol the
House¡" it was determined in the affirmative So the decision
of the Chair wasaffirmed
