SUBSISTENCE DEPARTMENT, C. S. ARMY,

Richmond, Va., March 11, 1862.

Mr. R. T. WILSON,

London, Roane County, Ten.:

SIR: Your letter of the 1st instant reached here on the 8th. My report to the resolution of Congress showed that a due regard to the possible contingency of injury from the enemy was entertained, and our consultation and schedule of places before you left Richmond exhibit the intention as soon as the meat was ready to be received that it was to have been distributed to various points of the interior. This precaution was determined on, although the commanding general had preferred a reserve at Bowling Green. In face of this fact, known previous to your departure from Richmond, it was not reasonable to risk the injury of moving meat not ready. I am happy to find by your letter that on your return and before the fall of Fort Henry you, concluding that the meat at Clarksville and Nashville was sufficiently salted to bear removal, and that the roads preferred taking it in packages, had begun to put it up for transportation southward; also that the fall of Henry caused you to change your proceeding, and at once resort to the most rapid removal in your power. You will please endeavor to collect all further information possible respecting the quantity destroyed or abandoned and communicate thereon. I am sorry that your private loss has been so heavy, and glad that your attention has been devoted to the care of the public property. When you write give details on this feature of the affair.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

L. B. NORTHROP,

Commissary-General of Subsistence.
