HEADQUARTERS,Saint Louis, September 20, 1861.

Colonel JEFFERSON C. DAVIS, Jefferson City:

How many carbines and how much ammunition can you furnish?

J. C. FREMONT,

Major-General, Commanding.

JEFFERSON CITY, September 20, 1861.

The guns I have are those issued to Colonel Nugent's Missouri cavalry. I don't know the number, but I can arm a regiment some way or other. The colonel, when he left, told me there was a full supply of ammunition.

JEFF. C. DAVIS,

Acting Brigadier-General.

Major General J. C. FREMONT.
HEADQUARTERS OF THE WESTERN DEPARTMENT,Saint Louis, September 20, 1861.

Colonel JEFFERSON C. DAVIS, Jefferson City:

Concentrate a force strong enough, in your judgment, at Georgetown, and push forward to relieve Mulligan. I trust that you can take provisions for two days with the means of transportation which you have. Order back your boats to Jefferson City, and send provisions and troops by them to Lexington. Two hundred wagons will be sent from here to-night to Syracuse, which will follow you. Troops are going from here. Answer.

J. C. FREMONT,

Major-General, Commanding.

JEFFERSON CITY, September 20, 1861.

I will send on the troops as fast as possible. Two days' provisions from Syracuse won't answer to reach lexington and engage an enemy. I will attempt it, however.

JEFF. C. DAVIS,

Acting Brigadier-General.

Major-General FREMONT.
HEADQUARTERS, September 20, 1861.

Acting Brigadier General JEFFERSON C. DAVIS, Jefferson City:

Dispatch received. Take as much provisions as will answer. Never let the men go into action without food. We, on our part, intend to move promptly from here. Use your judgment for details.

J. C. FREMONT,Major-General, Commanding.
