LA GRANGE, December 1, 1863.

(Received 2nd.)

Major-General HURLBURT,

Memphis:

Colonel Hatch is just in with his force. The Seventh Illinois is now out toward Ripley. Do you want the balance of cavalry all here but one regiment? I can move with greater facility to have a train here, which will leave men and animals in much better condition.

Do you expect me to take the garrison from Saulsbury and Middleton, &amp;c., as I go? Hatch suggests that he be sent to attack the flank or rear of column moving on Pocahontas.

J. M. TUTTLE,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS SIXTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Memphis, Tennessee, December 1, 1863.

Colonel EDWARD HATCH,

La Grange:

Mizner is at Ruckersville hard pressed, and must fall back to Pocahontas to-morrow. Tuttle is ordered forward as soon as there is light to travel. Leave a few cavalry with Morgan at La Grange, and move up to support Mizner until the infantry come up. Confer with General Tuttle on this subject freely. You can cover his march and yet aid Mizner materially.

Grierson is here while I send this.

Brigadier-General TUTTLE,

La Grande:

Mizner has been driven back to Ruckersville. Move toward Pocahontas to-night as soon as the moon gives you light enough. You must keep the connection with Corinth; to do that you must be at Pocahontas in time to check him there. Take up your garrisons as you go along. Leave Morgan at La Grange.

S. A. HURLBUT,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SIXTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Memphis, Tennessee, December 1, 1863-10.30 p. m.

Brigadier-General TUTTLE,

La Grange:

Take your troops up as you go; you will want them all. Hatch has his orders and will consult you. I cannot send trains for your batteries and you cannot do without them. I can send a train for a single regiment, but if any portion marches the whole should.

S. A. HURLBUT,

Major-General.
