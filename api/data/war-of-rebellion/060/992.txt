FORTRESS MONROE, VA., April 26, 1864.

(Received 12.15 p.m.)

Honorable GIDEON WELLES,

Secretary of the Navy:

Will you please order by telegraph that all Farragut's tugs which were ordered to the Gulf last Sunday from New York be sent here as early as practicable; also, the Canonicus at New York and Saugus at New York and Eutaw at Washington? All the double-enders and tugs at New York should be hurried to this point.

G. V. FOX,

Assistant Secretary of the Navy.

CULPEPER, VA., April 27, 1864.

(Received 3 p.m.)

Major-General HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

Cannot the bridges between Bull Run and Rappahannock be held when we move from here by troops from Washington? Block-houses have been built, so that 2,000 men would be sufficient whilst the army is in front. They should be supplied with thirty days' rations, so that there would be no necessity of sending cars over the road.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

[Indorsement.]

Copy to General Augur April 29.

ROBERT N. SCOTT,

Aide-de-Camp.

CULPEPER, VA., April 27, 1864-1.30 p.m.

(Received 3.20 p.m.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

There are rumors brought in by deserters that Longstreet, re-enforced by Beauregard's troops, will move down the Shenandoah Valley. Should they do so, throw all the force as necessary. If such a movement is commenced by the enemy after we start from here I will follow him with force enough to prevent his return south.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

CULPEPER, April 27, 1864-8.30 a.m.

Major-General MEADE,

Headquarters Army of the Potomac:

General Burnside's command leaves Alexandria this morning to take position between Bull Run and the Rappahannock. You can give orders to your troops to move to the front as soon as relieved and guards posted.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
