Major General A. E. BURNSIDE,

Cincinnati:

Thanks for your promptness. You have done more than I could have expected or asked. Any help you send will be more likely needed from Parkersburg this way than at Wheeling. Scammon may soon need up the Kanawha aid which I cannot give him. My trouble on the railroad has been want of cavalry.
