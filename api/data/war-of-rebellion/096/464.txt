HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,February 7, 1865. (Received 1.15 p. m.)

Bvt. Major General A. S. WEBB,

Chief of Staff:

General Willcox reports that, from a careful observation this morning, he is inclined to think that the reported gap in the line of chevaux-de-frise is owing to a depression in the ground; that the points of the stakes seemed visible near the surface. No unusual camp-fires or other evidence of increased force on his front.

JNO. G. PARKE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,February 7, 1865-12.40 p. m.

General HARTRANFT:

GENERAL: In the event of its being absolutely necessary, I shall draw from your line about 1,500 men to support General Warren, or my left. There is no probability of any attack from the enemy where you are. Please be prepared to answer such a call as the above promptly.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General, Commanding.

Major-General GREGG:

When ordered by the major-general commanding to take two brigades of your division to Rowanty Post-Office, this point is designated as the most suitable for the purpose of watching the Halifax road and the road to W. Perkins'. You can post your command in what you consider the most suitable position to accomplish this end, and should you find it difficult to supply your command at this point you are authorized to move back to vicinity of Fort Dushane, watching these roads. Report the position chosen to Generals Warren and Humphreys, and to these headquarters.
