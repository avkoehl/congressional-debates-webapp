HDQRS. OF THE ARMY, ADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE, Washington, February 18, 1862.

Major General JOHN A. DIX, U. S. Army,Commanding, &amp;c., Baltimore, Md.

SIR: Your letter of the 14th of February inclosing a number of the newspaper called The South was submitted to the Secretary of War. I now inclose an official copy of his order in the case sent by telegraph the receipt of which you have already acknowledged. I am directed by the Secretary of War to say that he was not a little suprised you should have waited for specific orders under the circumstances stated in your letter. There is a strong desire among the Union men of the city to have the print suppressed, which desire is certainly most consistent with a proper view of the public safety if the leading editorial of the number forwarded by you is a fair sample of its original articles. You are not likely to err by any vigorous effort to suppress treason of so malignant a nature as is manifested by that paper.

I am, sir, &c.,

L. THOMAS,

Adjutant-General.
