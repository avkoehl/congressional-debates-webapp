Major General W. S. ROSECRANS,

Saint Louis, Mo.:

Will you please inform me whether General Smith's troops have all embarked and started for this place, and if so when they left. I can hear nothing of them at Paducah. Have you received my dispatch relative to remounting of Winslow's cavalry at Saint Louis? Please answer whether this can be done immediately, so that I can have them here at an early day. I am much in need of all the troops I can get, and await their arrival anxiously.

Have sent you 4,000 men from this department, and will do everything to aid you. All our troops were entirely broken down in the Price raid; Winslow worst of all. Rosecrans temporarily absent.
