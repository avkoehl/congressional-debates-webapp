Since General Sheridan's last dispatch I have received yours. Shall I remain here, as directed by Sheridan, or return, as directed by you, probably before you received his last?

RECTORTOWN, VA., October 13, 1864-9.35 p.m.

Major-General HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

I have just received the following dispatch from the cavalry at the front:
HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY BRIGADE,Piedmont, Va., October 13, 1864-7.15 p.m.

GENERAL: I have the honor to state that one of Mosby's men just captured reports that a detachment of infantry, cavalry, and artillery from the Valley forces of the rebels advanced yesterday morning to within about eight miles of this place, near Rixey's farm, at the lower end of the Cobbler Mountain, southwesterly from Salem, with the intention of interfering with the further construction of the line of railroad. This force fell back, as is reported, in consequence of Federal cavalry from the Valley appearing in their rear. This Federal party drove off some cattle, burned Chancellor's mill, on the Rappahannock, but, as it is reported, were driven back to the Valley. All quiet here at present.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. S. GANSEVOORT,

Colonel, Commanding.
