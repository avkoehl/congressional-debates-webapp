No. 7. Report of Captain John Fisher, Sixth West Virginia Infantry, of operations November 28.
HDQRS. COMPANY A, SIXTH WEST VIRGINIA VOL. INFTY.,Piedmont, W. Va., November 30, 1864.

GENERAL: I have the honor of making the following report of the engagement at Piedmont, W. Va., on the 28th of November:

About 1 o'clock I learned that New Creek was surprised and captured. I was confident that the enemy would send a force here for the purpose of destroying the railroad shops and machinery. I ordered my detachment of twenty men from Bloomington here, which made my force number thirty-five effective men. The enemy, no less than 300 strong, under Major McDonald, approached the town about 2 p. m., on the New Creek road. I commenced skirmishing with them on this road, but finding that I was greatly outnumbered in force, I fell back across the river on the hill, where my position was more safe. This position gave me a good command of the town. They attempted to cross the river twice, but were repulsed each time. I fought them three hours, when they retreated on the Elk Garden road. They only succeeded in burning one of the round-houses of the shops. They left one man killed and one mortally wounded. I cannot give you the true number of wounded, but I think they had ten or fifteen wounded.

My command fought well and deserves the greatest praise. A large portion of them were recruits, and the first time they were under fire.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN FISHER,

Captain Company A, Sixth West Virginia Volunteer Infantry.
