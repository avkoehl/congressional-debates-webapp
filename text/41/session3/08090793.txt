THE OONGRE SS ION A L GLOBE.

object; and to his administration belongs the
glory of its consummation and the immense
and immediate expansion of our commerce
that ensued.
Let me pause for a moment to ask why the
fathers of the country were so anxious for the
privilege of direct trade with the West Indies,
and why the European Powers who had domin-
ion over the archipelago so persistently refused
to accord us the privilege of direct commerce
with our neighbors, of whose productions we
have ever been such large consumers ? It was
because those Governments saw, as clearly as
the statesmen of our country, the importance
to the American Republic of unrestricted trade
with the islands of the Caribbean sea, whose
waters wash our shores.
The fathers of the country having been forced
into armed rebellion by the restrictions imposed
by the Parliament of Great Britain upon the de-
velopment of our natural resources and manu-
facturing and commercial power, had learned
that international trade conducted exclusively
along parallels of latitude, and consequently
between nations producing the same commodi-
ties, could not be generally profitable to the
people of both countries, and must, if left to the
government of the laws of trade, uninfluenced
by a tariff of compensatory duties, be ultimately
beneficial only to those countries whose mines
had been opened, industries established, tools
and machinery paid for, in whole or in part., by
past profits, and who, with skilled and discip-
lined laborers and artisans, were also in the
enjoyment of capital; and must prevent or
restrict the progress in the arts of the younger
competitor, whose mines were to be opened,
factories built, machinery acquired, industries
organized; and all this with inadequate capital,
as was the case with the United States.
The only commerce in which, in theif condi-
tion, our fathers could hope to engage with ad-
vantage was with non-manufacturing and trop-
ical countries, from which they could obtain
those articles of food and raw material for manu-
facture which our country does not produce, and
whose people would require the productions of
the fields and workshops of our colder country.
To prevent the young Republic from carrying
to and from the West Indies was to deprive it
of the power to establish a commercial marine,
such as might provide and man a navy in time
of war, and to add the cost of transportation,
first to the mother country and thence to our
ports, with profits and commissions to foreign
merchants and bankers, to. the tropical food
and raw material its people might require for
consumption as food or in the arts. Hence
it was that every American patriot saw that
direct and even unrestricted trade with the
West India islands would be a blessing to the
country, and every European statesman per-
ceived with equal clearness that our maritime
and manufacturing power must be greatly re-
stricted, and we continue to be producers of
raw materials only, so long as this boon could
be withheld from us.
Nor, sir, are these considerations less potent
to day than they were in the infancy of the
country. The treachery of our great com-
mercial rival has swept our commercial marine
from the sea, and her ships are largely engaged
in bringing the productions of the West Indies
to our ports. Meanwhile the export duties laid
by ihe Governments of the islands, including
the Dominican republic, upon mahogany, fus-
tic, logwood, satin-wood, lance-wood, coffee,
cocoa, and other articles, and the import duties
which, although they do_ not compete with
our industries, but enter into our food or are
consumed in our manufactures, wo impose
upon them, are taxes upon our industry, banal-
cupping it in its race with the manufacturing
nations of Europe.
The fathers also saw the incompatibility ot
maintaining, under the simple Government
they had founded, a large standing army and
regular liavy. They perceived the necessity
of preparing for war in time ot peace, but they
felt themselves unable to bear the cost, and
clearly pereeived the danger to republican
institutions of maintaining great armies or a
great navy during peace, and wisely determ-
ined to rely upon the militia for the exigencies
of war. As to lahdforces, there was nodifficulty
in executing this purpose; but if they were to
rely upon the people for ships, officers, and
sailors in war, they must establish and main-
tain a commerce sufficiently extended to make
ships profitable and create a constantly aug-
menting commercial marine. Looking at Our
extended coast, they saw that if we were to be
prepared to defend it and to maintain our flag
upon the sea we must have ship-yards at many
points along the coast, skill and capital to use
them to advantage, and the trade in which to
profitably engage the vessels they would con-
struct. They believed in the constitutional
right to promote these great national objects
by special legislation, and did it promptly and
successfully. Denied the privilege of trading
with the West Indies they secured to American-
built ships, owned by American citizens domi-
ciled within the country, the entire carrying-
trade between the ports of the United States by
the provisions of the act of September 1, 1789,
for regulating the coasting trade, and for other
purposes.
This beneficent act, preceding which but
ten laws had been signed by Washington, and
which British ship-builders are imploring us to
repeal, limits the carrying between any ports
of the United States to vessels bearing an
American register, and denies such register to
any vessel not built within the States, and be-
longing wholly to a citizen or citizens thereof,
and, by section five, denies any part of our
domestic carrying-trade even to a "ship or
vessel owned in whole or in part by any
citizen of the United States usually residing
in any foreign eountry, unless he be an agent
for or a partner in some house or copartner-
ship consisting of citizens of the United States
actually carrying on trade in the said States."
We have to thank the prescience which or-
dained these wise provisions in the earliest
days of our national existence for the mag-
nificent results kchieved upon the ocean and
lakes by our Navy in the war of 1812, for the
commanding proportions our commercial ma-
rine had assumed when the unhappy rebellion
enabled England to drive it from the sea, and
fof the ability of our merchants to furnish the
Government promptly with adequate transport-
ation for troops and taunitions of war arid to
maintain a substantial blockade of more than
two thousand miles of coast.
The acquisition of San Domingo would bring
the territory of that republic within the influ-
ence of this venerable and wholesome law, and
thus do more to stimulate ship-building and
expandthe eommefceof the country than could
be done by giving effect to the wisest sugges â€¢
tions upon the subject that have been brought
befora the House by bill or report since the
close of the r^Jiellion.
No gentleman who has not given special
attention to this question can have any idea of
the proportion our commerce with the West
India islands bears to our entire foreign com-
merce. Whethei1 tested by the amount we im-
port frotn each country, or by the total of our
imports and exports to and from each country,
our trade with the West India islands stands
second; that with the United Kingdoms of
England, Scotland, and Ireland alone exceed-
ing it. It is true that our exports to France
exceed our exports to the West Indies; but our
imports from the islands are more than fifty per
cent, in advance of those from France. The
countries having dominion over these islands
are careful to so regulate their trade that while
the American people may be the chief consum-
ers of the raw materials produced by their
colonies, their own fields, factories and work-
shops, and not ours, shall supply them with the
cereals and productions of agricultural and
manufacturing skill and industry. In order
that gentletnen may have the subject fairly and
fully before them, I present a statement of the
commerce of the United States with all other
countries for the year ending June 30, 1870, as
shown by the report of the Secretary of the
Treasury on commerce and navigation. It is

Some of my friends who remember the
energy with which I have hitherto opposed the
acquisition of southern territory may deem me
inconsistent in advocating earnestly, as '
the acquisition of San Domingo; but it they
will listen for ft moment they will, I tnink, per-
ceive that I could not maintain my consistency
and do otherwise, Believing, as I have lonj
doiie, that commerSe, to be generally and en
duringly profitable to both parties, must cross
parallels of latitude and not run upon them,
I have believed that it would add to the com-
pleteness of our country to iicqnire tropical
or semi-tropical territory with the people of
which we might exchange, under our own rev-
