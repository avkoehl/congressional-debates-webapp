Major H. BALDWIN,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Fairfax Cour-House:

Force sent to White Plains returned. Party by way of Warrenton met small squad at Salem that escaped toward Waterloo. Party by Hopewell Gap and Middleburg met several small squads that fled, after a little skirmishing, to the mountains. Party via New Baltimore and Georgetown met nothing. Force sent to hold Thoroughfare Gap had pickets driven in from this side, but held place until arrival of the united columns from Plains, when a sharp skirmish ensued, resulting in our dislodging and dispersing them in every direction. The enemy numbered sixty. Fight lasted twenty minutes; 2 rebels known to be killed; 3 wounded, 1 mortally. We brought in 6 prisoners. Our loss, 2 horses killed and 2 wounded. The various parties brought in 15 horses. This expedition demonstrated no considerable force from Warrenton to Middleburg, but Mosby is said to have now, somewhere in or about Aldie, a piece of artillery taken in yesterday from way of Waterloo. All quiet this way.
