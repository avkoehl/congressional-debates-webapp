Chief of Staff, Army of the Potomac:

I have the honor to report that a scouting party sent last night to Temple's, on the plank road, found in that vicinity about seventy-five of the enemy's cavalry. The enemy generally have a picket-post at that point. The officer commanding the regiment on picket, from which the scouting party was sent, reports that the rebel pickets were driven off and his party remained at Temple's until after daylight. Nothing new on any other portion of the cavalry line.
