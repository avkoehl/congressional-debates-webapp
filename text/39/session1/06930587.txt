THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
I appeal to the revelations of the census.
My statistics do not include the former
slaves, but the white people of the South
and the few freed negroes found among them
in 1800.
In the first place I would quote the following
very complete table, furnished' me by the Cen-
sus Bureau, and giving the total results upon
this subject for the whole United States: .
Persons over twenty years of age unable to read and write, eighth census, 1800.

It appears from this table that the adult male
while and free negro population of the United
States, in I860, over twenty years of ago, who
could not read and write was but little short
of half a million. In other words, that in the
last presidential election, if the entire popula-
tion oftheUnited States had voted, halt'a mil-
lion votes would have been cast by men who
could not read and write.
When we recollect that upon our presidential
elections depend the great interests and the life
of the country, and remotely the cause of all
mankind, we may well stand appalled before
this vast force of half a million ignorant men
deciding the destinies of the world.
But if we look exclusively at the southern
States we find still greater cause for surprise
and alarm.
The following table shows the number of illit-
erate male whites in seven southern States; also
the total vote of those States in 1800, and the
vote given in each State in the same year for
Breckinridge :

i If we examine this table, we find that in the
seven States named the number of illiterate
is about one fifth the total number of voters,
and nearly one half the total vote for Breck-
inridge, the representative of disunion and
| secession.
! If, however, we add to each man entirely
illiterate one other who, while able to read and
: write his name, derives no practical advantage
from these mere rudiments of education in form-
, inghis opinions, we will find the total to be more
; than one third of the total vote and five sixths
of the vote for Breckinridge.
j The total number of illiterate in the south-
ern States in 1800, over twenty years of age,
exclusive of the then slaves, was 545,177. In
these, with the comparatively ignorant associ-
ated with them, we see the upholders of {lie
rebellion at the ballot-box and'in the field.
Without these it could never have been in-
augurated, or if inaugurated could never have
) maintained itself for six months against the
mighty levies of the Union.
But, it may be said, these evils will correct
themselves. Thetestimonvis all Ihe other way:
From 1840 to 1800, a period of twenty years,
the number of illiterate over twenty years rose
from 549,093 to 1,218.811 : in other words, an
increase of considerably more than one hun-
dred per cent. !
At the same ratio of growth it would be
2,074,472 in 1880; 5,823,700 in 3900; and in
1920 it would amount to the enormous total ot
" 12,590,088.
11 In other words, in fifty years from the taking
of the next census, the illiterate in the United
States over twenty years, exclusive of the freed-
mcn, will be 12,500,000, four times the number
j, with which the nation commenced its career.
I' nearly one half the total white population in
1800, and representing a voting force one third
greater than the total vote at the presidential
election in 1800; that is to say, over 6,000,000
voters!
Who will pretend that with such a mass of
ignorance the Government could survive? It
would be buried in the most disgraceful anarchy
the world has evcr'seen.
But, Mr. Speaker, even these appalling figures
do not tell the whole story. These figures do
not include the then slaves, nowfreedmen. We
must add to the ignorant population 'of the
South the 4,000,000 blacks just released from
slavery.
The figures would stand as follows:
NUMBER OF ILlITKltAlE.
Year. 11 Inte. Black. Total.
• 18S0  2,674,472 3,309,175 5,983,647
1900   5,823,700 4,765,212 10,588,912
1920 12,596,688 5,994,812 18,591,500
| So that in fifty years from the next census,
: a very short period in the life of a nation, when
it is supposed that the total population will be
120.000,000, the illiterate will be one fifth of
the'entire number and nearly one third of the
entire vote.
I trust, then, that no sentleman will doubt
. the propriety of the amendment I have submit-
! ted. We are interfering in behalf of the negro;
' let us interfere to educate him. We thus strike
out at one blow a large proportion of the igno-
rance of the South; we shame the whites into
an effort to educate themselves, and we prepare
thus both classes for the proper exercise of the
right of suffrage.
■ Nor shall it be said that the ignorancc re-
vealed by lliese statistics is an exotic, that it
results from foreign immigration. While it is
j true that in the Nortli a large proportion of the
i illiterate are from foreign lands, in the South
