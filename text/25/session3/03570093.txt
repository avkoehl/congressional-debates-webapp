25th Cong....3d Sess.
Defalcation of Samoel Swartwout—Mr. Toucey.
Ho. of Reps.
found that two of them, at least, had gone with
him generally m most of the votes which he had
no ground to distiust the correctness of, and he
doubted much whether ihe impartial judgment of
the country, if ever brought to bear upon the pro-
ceedings of that committee, would not find more
to blame in his votes than those of some of tne
other four membeis He said he had failed to
taKe that ground m the aigument, because it wis
unnecessary to do so, that without a he had
shown a most tnumphantjusufication
He said he had heard a remark made by the
gentleman from Kentucky,[Mr U\dfhwood,] that
not only suipnsed, but mortified him 1 hatgen-
tlemanhad said that he now looked for better times
than heretofoie under the administration cf Gen-
eral Jackson, that this expectation was justified
in the fact that the people had ceased to fire guns
on the 8th of Januaiy Great God' (said Mr
M ) has it come to this, that honorable gentlemen
upon this floor can consider it an evidence of the
approach of better times, that the people cease to
celebrate the victories of the nation's armies' He
considered it the most conclusive evidence that the
spirit of patriotism was departing from the re¿ion
in which the feelings which induced such rejoic-
ings are not felt upon the arrival of that glouous
day
Mr. UNDERWOOD here asked leave to ex-
plain, which was accorded Mr TJ said the gen-
tleman from Alabama had misunderstood his re-
marks, that he meant only to say that, since
General Jackson had gone out of power, those
who rejoiced at his achievements h ietofore, had
ceased to rejoice, he having no office to bestow
upon them That he (Mr. U ) rejoiced as much
at the victories of our country as any gentleman
upon this floor
M- MARTIN resumed He said he was glad
that he had misunderstood the gentleman, for he
could not suppose that one who had borne so
honorable a part in the defense of the country,
during the last war, as the gentleman from Ken-
tucky, could ever meet the dawn of that glouous
day, the 8th of January, without the warmest
glow of exultation and patriotic pride, and that,
when thia feeling shall cease in our land, for one,
he should despair of the Republic
Mr M said he deptecated the range which this
debate had taken Gentlemen had discussed this
question, involving simply the mode by which the
committee should be appointed, as if theieport of
a committee presentingall of the facts of the trans
action were before the House for consideration,
and they were making eftbits to convict some
officer of high crimes and misdemeanois This,
he said, he consideied highly improper How
could gentlemen know who would be placed upon
that committee5 And was any gentleman willing to
be placed in the situation of a judge, aftei having
prejudged the case' Although he was exceed
wgly desirous to have the case investigated fully
and strictly, yet he desu ed that it should be fairly
and impartially done, and in a manner, too to in-
spire this House and the country with confidence
in the result The debate (said Mr M ) was
improper in another point of view, the tune in
which the investigation must be made is short,
and this length of discussion is wasting it most
unnecessarily If gentlemen 'eel what they profess,
they must see that their end will be best attained
by taking the vote without furthei delay He said
he trusted that that course would be taken by the
House, and that the committee will, withoutdelay,
enter upon their labois

On the Resolution providing for the appomtmert I
of a Committee to investigate the Defalcations  '
of Samuel Swartwout
Mr. TOUCEY said                                                  |l
Mr   Speaker    I congratulate the gentleman  I
from Pennsylvania who has just resumed his seat '
on the distinguished success wi* i which he has
redeemed his piomise to mtioiuce refreshing nov-
elty in'o this deba'e by sticking to the question,
especially in tha part of his speech whicn lelated
to the piactice of purchasing books for the use of
members
The subject principally involved in the resolu-
tion now before the House is the Jefa cation of the
late collector of the port of hew Yoik     It has
indeed been so modified as 1.0 emb ace the defaults
of otoers, of Geneial Giatiot and of William M
Puce, the one an of ponuit, the other a friend of
the piesent Administration      But these ire com-
paratively unimportant     It has been said that the
Government ultimately , willlose nothing by either
of them     Perhaps so     Ce tainly the amount will
be comparatuely small    The principal subject of
tne investigation, therefore, is, what it was origin-
ally intended to be, the immense and extraordi-
nary defalcation  of Samuel Swartwout, the late
collectoi of the port of INew York, who nai em-
bezzled more than a million of the public moi ey
This is the subject, the defalcation of this man, i
now, and for years, the political opponent of the
piesent Chief Magistrate, one who opposed his !
election to the Presidency in 1836   one who now
is, and long has been, identified with the Opposi-
tion as a zealous political partisan     And theques
tion is, whether the appointment of a tonmittee
to investigate this matter shall, by the extraordi-
nary action of this body, be taken away fiom its
Presiding Officer, and transferí ed to the friends of
this defaulter     Political friends, I mean, foi none
vindicate him      Su, the argument of the gentle
man  from  Mississippi, [Mi    Prestí"; ,]   uigel
also by the gentleman fioii Pennsylvania, [Mr
BirDLi.,] on the other side of the qiestion,anphes
with veiy great force—that an offender ¡should not
be put into the h inds of his friends if the object be
to bring the trutn to light, oi the offender to jus-
tice     " Shall the cult nt airaignedat thebai htve
the privilege of putting his own friends upon the
bench,orín thejmy box5"    Shall the Oppi si ion
here reveise  the   long   pract ce  of this   Hou e,
which has been  sanctioned  by all parties  for si
many years, to take the investigation of the mis
deeds of one of their own friends into th°n own
hands'    Shall this plunderer of the public money-
have the boon of such a scrutiny'    I ins  is the
question, this is the contest, this is the strug¿ie
which we have witnessed for so many days
Sir, I do not discovei, in this state of things, a l|
sufficient reason   for  departing  fiom   the  usual
course     We have organized the House by tne
choice of our own Speaker, and by the appoint
ment through him  of tl a usual committees   we   I
have confided to them the most impoitant   iftairs
of this nation—suljrrfs of transperdent interest—
the great questions and measures which agitate the
country, and in doing so, w have only conformed
to the established usage of this  Hiuse, and of
anular legislative bodies      Shall we now, in a
matter which, tnough important, is much le«s ím
portant, disrobe the Speaker of the ptoner powers
of Ill's oficial station, m wlu< h he has  acquitted
himself with distinguished ab uty anJ ltnpurtialitv,
to put the investigation of tne frauds and embez
zlements of a great p=e uator into the hands of
his political friends >    S r, 1 see i o suffic en   rea
son for this most extraordinary course    Tne argu
menta  of the gentlemen  fiom   Mississippi  and
Pennsylvania are, to my mind, conclusive against
it
The gentleman from Virginia, who sits before |
me, [Mr G\ria\d,] has offered an amendment,
that the committee shall be appoirted by ballot    '
Now, sir, I know that that gentleman is opposed
to the seaet ballut     I know him to be an advocate   '
of the ittd voce Mile      The pract ce of his State
requnes it       His own judgment dictates it       I
would then ask, how he can insist on this an end   I.
ment, which is the same ii ng precisely as to
declare m terms that ihis committee shall be ap-
pointed by secret ballot      Sir, I am against the
amendment     I am against the secret ballot in a
repiesen'ative body     It is opposed to the princi
pie of our Government—to the genius of the Con-
stitution     It is utterly unwor I y of this Ho ise
that the official action of theRepresentat \eenouid
beseciet   The close o«llotfor the people may be right  1
fot the ultimate sovereignty is m them They are
not accountable for then action to any other body
Bat we, as public agents, as representatives of
tne people, exercising sovereign powers m their
name and light, are directly and immediately ac-
co mtable to them for cseiy act done by virtue of
the delegated authoiuy, and, therefore, our action
should be open, public, known without being
sought aftei All the arguments which have been,
or can be, urged against it, would, if followed
out in then legitimate consequences, require us to
seal up our Journal, abonsh the right to demand
the yeas and nays, ciose our doors against re-
porters and against the public, and sit perpetually
in secret conclave Piibiic ty is the basis of it-
sponsibiht;,, not to the members of this bony, but
to the country—to the people who sent us here
| There is no argument against the one, which does
not go equally to the destruction of the other
Oui action should be open, known to our eonstit
uents, known to the whole country, not for the
purpose of creating any undue dependence any-
where, but to secureand enforce tne just responsi-
bility of the public servant, the just right of the
constituent body, and the just power of public
sentiment
The gentleman from Kentucky [Mr Uhder-
VvOodj has inquired why such defaults have not
occurred under former Administrations' Su,I
have listened to this debate, I have observed the
tone of defiance and the extravagance of declama-
tion which gentlemen have indulged in If any
one, casually present here, were to judge from the
speeches on that side of the House, he would sup-
pose that such i thing as a defalcation of a public
ofeei was unknown m this Government until
President Jackson came into power What would
be his surprise, his astonishment, tobe informed,
at er such reckless boldness of accusation, that
the Government had ne\er been more fortunate
or more fiee fiom these losses, than since the
arce o on oi that honest and heroic man to the
Pieai ienoy a id that the late and present Admin
istiations, for the prudence the skill, the energy
and success, with which they have conducted the
finances, might justly challenge a comparison with
all foimer times '
Sir, I call the attention of the House and of the
countiy to th" fact that, when the late President
came into oftice, in 1829, the past losses of the
lieasury exceeded seventeen nulli ms of dollar ,
while the actuil loss during the eight years of his
Administration was less than a million, not one
fourtn pan of the average of all former Admmis
trations The whole imount of the losses of the
Tieasurv, fiom the yeai 1789, when the Corsti
tution was adopted and tne Government estab-
lished, to the 4th of March, 1837, when Geneial
fachson retned fiom ofhce, exceeded eighteen
mil'ions of dollars Dunng the same time, the
aggrezate of revenue collected was a thousand
millions Of that sum rnoie than one fourth part,
more than two bundled an I fifty millions of do!
lars was col tcted dunng the Administration of
General Jackson If I is Administration had been
no more eucees ful than those whicn preceded it,
i1- the liases of th" Treasury had been as gren
undei him as they weie under his predecessors,
the/ would have amounted to folk millions and
a FiLr But, sir, they were llss than a mil-
lion, and if you add all the losses which have
sirce occurred under the Administration of Mr
Van   Buien, they  will  still í,ot lulal the
4VFR\CL, \OR HALF THAT  SLM
On the 4 hof March, 1837, the Government had
losf, since the formation of the Cor stitution, more
than six millions by banks si t millions and a half
by merchants'bonds foi du íes near a million ard
a half by collectors ai d receivers (including mar-
shals and attmneys ) an 1 about four millions and
a quarter by disomsing ofHceis All these losses
grew out of the system, which has long been m
torce with lit le \arution, and which we are en
deavonng to reform I include five millions of
losses by depre la ed and worthless bank paper
Without that, the amount would be thi teen mil
lions And now, su , by tne rale of equality, the
late Adrmnistntion should have lost fo ir millions
ard a half, or, n anv view, tnree millions and a
qiarier, to bang it down to the level of       se
