THOMAS 1). ELTOT,
WILLIAM D. KELtiEY,
Manager? on the part of the House,
CHARLES SUMNER,
J. M. HOWARD,
Managers on the part of the Senate.
Mr. DAVIS. I will state several objections
that I have to the adoption of this report. The
first is to the reception of the report itself. It
begins in these words:
That the Senate recede from their amendment to the
said bill, and the committee agree to the following as a
substitute.
According to parliamentary Taw and the rules
of this House, I think the proposition is true that
a committee of conference cannot decide any ques-
tions whatever except those that are in issue be-
tween the two Houses and upon which they have
disagreed. This question was made formal! y some
two years ago, and the Senate then solemnly ad-
judged in favor of the proposition which I have
laid down, if I remember right. I had hoped that
thehonorable Senator from Massachusetts whose
name is signed to this report [Mr. Sumner]
would have explained to the Senate the points and
matters outside of the issues between the two
Houses that are introduced into this t '11. I should
like the honorable Senator to make that expla-
nation before I proceed further in my remarks, if
it is agreeable to him.
Mr. SUMNER. Very well, I can do so now.
Mr. President, the Senator from Kentucky [Mr.
Davis] raises a question of form, or rather of
order. He suggests that the committee have erred
in reporting a new.bill. The Senator is mistaken.
This was done in the case of the difference be-
tween the two Houses on the confiscation bills,
and also in another difference on a tnuflT bill. I
have in my hand the Journal of the Senate for
August 2, 1861, where may be found the report
of a conference committee, which was followed by
the committee on the present occasion. A new
tariff bill, from beginning to end, was reported as
a substitute, and the report was adopted. This is
all that 1 think it necessary to say on the ques-
tion of form.
Mr. POWELL. The Senator from Massa-
chusetts will allow me to ask him if there was
any objection made to that report in 1SC1.
Mr. SUMNER. It does not appear that there
was any objection.
Mr. POWELL. That was the reason it was
passed m that way.
Mr. SUMNER. I think if the Senator reflects
he will see that there could be no objection. There ,
was no objection, I think, certainly none that was
sustained,to the report of theconfereneecommit-
tee on the confiscation bill. I trustthat there wi.il
be no opposition to this mostimportant, and, asl
solemnly believe, most beneficent measure. But
I shall be happy to make any explanation with
regard to it.
Senators have not forgotten the bill to create a
Bureau of Freedmen, which, after careful debate
for several days, was passed by the Senate at the
close of the last sessio.n as a substitute for a House'
bill on the same subject. For some-time the dif-
ference between the two Houses has been under the
consideration of a conference committee, whoso
report is now before you. This report embodies
substantially the Senate bill, including various
propositions moved by different Senators; among
others the proposition relating to the forfeiture of
estates, moved by the Senator from Illinois, [Mr.
Trumbull;] that relating to the care of freedmen
unemployed on the lands, moved by the Senator
from West Virginia, [Mr. Willey;] and that
relating to trials by courts-martial, moved by the
Senator from Wisconsin, [Mr. Doolittle.] AU
of the Senate bill, in substance, and generally in
language, is preserved, with one single exception.
By the Senate bill a bureau was created in the
Treasury. The committee of the two Houses
unite in recommending a separate Department,
holding directly under the President, and there-
fore free from the control of either the Treasury
or the War.
In point of fact, the only substantial difference
between the two Houses was on the place where
the bureau should be. Each was for a bureau;
but one was for it in the Treasury and the other
was for it in the Department of War; and there
were strong arguments in favor of each. There
$vere also strong feelings expressed againsteach.
Sometimes it was compendiously said that the โข
freedmen could not be trusted to ii the harpies of
the Treasury,Mand then again it was said, with โข
equal point, that they could not be trusted to " the
blood-hounds of the War." These were the ex-
aggerations of opposite opinions; but they serve
to disclose the irreconcilable discord on the sub-
ject. In attempting to avoid Scylla we were car-
ried to Charybdis.
If the freedmen could have been provided foy
without reference to the lands, the question wouid
have been relieved from much of its embarrass-
ment. But it was the conviction of the commit-
tee, in which they were sustained by all most
familiar with the matter, that the care of the freed-
men and the care of the abandoned lands ought
to be in the same hands, and that they could not
be separated without exposing the freedmen to
all the mischiefs of two conflicting jurisdictions.
But the War Office was not ada-pted to manuge
the lands, as many insisted that the Treasury was
not adapted to manage the freedmen.
There was another consideration which was not
without influence. It was felt that each of these
great Departments of the Government was already
so severely burdened, so weighed down with
manifold duties, that it was hardly in condition
to assume a new trust, so grave and onerous as
that now under consideration:
For such reasons, sir, and yielding to such in-
fluences, the committee, after most careful and
conscientious deliberation, determined to recom-
mend a new Department, not unlike that of agri-
culture, which should not be subject eitherto the
Treasury or to the War. It was foit that in do-
ing this they were doing the best for the cause,
and they were not insensible also to the consider-
ation that in "this way they should be able to se-
cure a high order of'talent and of chaiacter for
this branch of public servicc. Men fitted for
Treasury agents, or fitted for War, might not al-
ways be the best for the care of freedmen. The
man for thishumane servicc should be humane by
nature, and should sympathize especially wUh
that race which has so long been neglected and
outraged. They must be versed, if I may so
express myself, in the humanities of the ques-
tion.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. It becomes
the duty of the Chair to call up the special order
for one o'clock.
Mr. SUMNER. I hope I may be allowed to
go on, at least to finish this statement. I can go
on informally.
Mr. CHANDLER. I am informed by the
