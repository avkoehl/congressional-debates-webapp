the maneuver for want of it. I respectfully ask that the Quartemaster-General be directed to take measures for the immediate purchase of a large number of wagons and teams. Agents should be sent to different parts of the State and wherever else may be deemed expedient. This need is urgent. Our enemies are exerting themselves to the utmost.

Your obedient servant,

Hard bread and bacon most needed. Six hundred barrels of flour purchased-to be delivered to-morrow. Beef and cattle abundant. A regular supply of flour may be had on favorable terms from neighboring mills.
