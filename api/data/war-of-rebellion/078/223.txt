HDQRS. DEPARTMENT AND ARMY OF THE TENNESSEE,Before Atlanta, Ga., August 4, 1864.

Major General C. C. WASHBURN,

Commanding District of WEST Tennessee:

GENERAL: In sending you the inclosed order, which places you in command of the District of Vicksburg, I am directed by Major- General Howard to state that much to the regret of this army in the field, Brigadier General Morgan L. Smith has been compelled to retire from the front, in consequence of his old wound, which has entirely disabled him for the present. General Smith has tendered his resignation but the interests of the service will not admit of its acceptance, and the general commanding trusts that rest will soon enable him to take command of some post or district, and makes the suggestion that he would make an excellent commander of the District of Vicksburg. He will be ordered to report to you. Until the close of this campaign shall afford time to effect a reorganization of the corps of this army it will be necessary to continue all reports as heretofore from the District of Vicksburg, which is occupied by the troops of the Seventeenth Corps.

I have the honor to be, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. T. CLARK,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
