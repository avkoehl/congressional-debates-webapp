HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DISTRICT OF HARPER'S FERRY,Harper's Ferry, November 19, 1864.

Lieutenant Colonel J. W. FORSYTH,

Chief of Staff, Middle Military Division, In the Field:

COLONEL: Two of Captain Bazer's men came in this morning, Privates Harris and Johnson. They report that Mosby, with 300 men, attacked Blazer near Kabletown yesterday about 11 o'clock. They say that the entire command, with the exception of themselves, was either captured or killed.

I have the order out Major Congdon, with 300 Twelfth Pennsylvania Cavalry, to Kabletown, to bury dead and take care of wounded, if any, and report all facts he can learn. Shall immediately furnish report as soon as received.

Respectfully,

JOHN D. STEVENSON,

Brigadier-General.

Major-General HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

Dispatches from City Point making it evident that much of Early's force is going to Richmond, I think it advisable to send the Sixth Corps there at once. One division of cavalry should also go, unless they can get through to cut the Central road and canal.
