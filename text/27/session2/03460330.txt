more miserable spectacle of vacillating and imbecile legislation
on asubiect most deeply affecting the ciedit of trre States, than
passing a law deciding that the proceeds of the public lands
should be divided among ire states and then repealing it m one
year? The gentleman horn Maiyland [Mr W Cost Johnson]
had sa d that two hundred thousand dollars of the proceeds of
the sales of the public lands were now in the Treasury, and the
gentleman from South Caiolina bad recommended that the Go
vernment of the United Sues should lepeal the law, having
neithei money norcieditto wag one step further without taking
back thetwo hundred thousand dollars that had been distributed
not twelve months ago, and that m Treasury notes, asa friend
su^ested If the gentleman from South Carolina carried these
principles he (Mr M ) must be allowed to confers his "scorn,"
his utter scorn and loath ng, for the imbecility which such a
couise would demonstrate
Mr PICKENS heie inquired if the proceeds of the public lands
wei e set aside to pay this very loan, if there would be any need
of the amendmeit of the gentleman fiom New York, proposing
to oUtn the public stock below parí
Mr MARSHALL said if the gentleman asked him, he could
answer if, mstea 1 of 8*00000 there were $10,000000 fiom the
proceeds of tne public lu Us in the public Treasury, after the
passage of the actofla«t session, 01 $20 000 000 on that side of
the Exchequer aid not a dollai on the Federal side, he, for
one, would not touch one stn er Would to God it was so1 If
this $20,000 000 could be distributed and they could raise the
revenue by a revenue law  of all the measures which the wis
dom of Congi ess could r'e vise, this would be the most effectual
m sustaining the pub icctedit—by which he meant the credit of
tne whole country Talk of set axatmg the public credit of the
Government from that of the people' He never did and never
could do it ihe States wrf individuals repudiate their debts,
andt en the General Gov rnment was to come in, and amid
the mm of private a 1 corpoiate credit among the United
States, «us im uscredi How? By taking back $200 000, and
holdng saeied and ui touched the puneip es of the compromise
act That was the most g irgeous scheme of finance thathadever
been pre eated to his imagination1 The moment a revenue bill
was proposed, looking to aí\ increase of duties, the gentleman,
with 'ome others on the floor, would take the alarm, and see a
piotective tariff staling him immeliately in the face Ac
cording to these views, from what souice weie they to de
rive revenue Was it from direct taxation? Our ports,
under this policy, weie ¡o be thrown wide open, our com
meice to be carried on in the most unequal terms and mode
in which it had been earned on for the last ten or twelve
years and winch was the cause of the confusion that now
prevails m the United States Onesided commerce' It
was a strange system He understood the gentleman from
South Carolina tu be in favor of a loan bill m preference to
Treasmy notes if they could only get the right sort of a loan
bill And what the right thing was, was the hardest thing in
the woild to determine 'hey agreed on principles, but al *
waysdifi red in deiatls The gentleman fiom South Carolina w
and hirme f ha 1 differed befoie 0 1 this loan bill When it was
firstpiop) el 1 w satoanfo eight yeais—the loan bill, as
I assed, was fot tí ¡ee y wis The geutlem n had diffeied with
hm on this snbiect but a°reed perfectly on the principle on
which he (Mr M ) contended foi a twelve years loan—the great
pnnuple on which turned the superiority of the public credit
over puvatecre it There were two mam and leading reasons
which in meed capitalists to prefer pubbc credit to pnvatecre
die The first inducement wasthe superiority of security, and
another was. the permanency of the investment On that prm
ciple he wentfoi prolongirg the loan He had then expressed
the opinion that, in thi«sUteof things, the Government would
fail in (btaiung a loan f 01 a short time and the gentleman from
SjuhCaioli rta^iee hat he was rig tm this, and jet went
fortheshii p-amue     Wh)? 1o defeat the loan al ogether

Mr MARSHALL I hen tne gentleman was unfriendly toa
loan, and advocate the veiy proposition to defeat it, and went
for the shoitest time lhe gentleman's explanation was, that
they should p y the public ieb not by a loan, but by retrench
ment T 1 s mattei of ie trench men t m a public debt already
contracted, he did not undersian 1 exeept it was hy payment or
by a gereiat aikrupt law [A voi e, llBy repudiation"
Lau,htei ] ihe ovjecr was to pay an existing debt, left as a
charge by the Adn migration just gone out of power
Mr FlCKEN ,(Mr M yielding the fiooi ) Dd not the gen
tleman I elieve that this loan bill wa& pressed now with a view
to ir a ease the tariff* That was the reason why they pressed
the loan bill before the tariff bill                *
Mr MARSHALL sail what miglu be the motives of other
gentlemen ne did not 1 ot know b it if [ less ng the loan bill
now would 1 ave the effect of expediting the action of the
House on the surject of V e revenue bill he would avow that it
woull be Lsuihci n motive to pre«sit The Tieastiry was
empiy It was 1 ever contemplated by the genius of our mtsü
tutions that theGoveinmei should have a large íevenue on
hand The molern doc rme ^a-> that the best Treasmy up to
the time of the demand foi money was the pockets of the pee

per oiise hey coul 1 su tain fu'lv before the whole world its
ciedit and n u He 1 ared the measure before them was one
ol a senes which wo ild 1 ave the effect of wounding our credit,
not beciu^e we had not ediund m le^ources both in the credit
an 1 iaitl of the people, but it would sink the public credit
