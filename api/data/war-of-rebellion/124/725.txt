adopted, in the execution of which we found the people much excited, considerably scared, and not all disposed to fight. We arrived at Chilli at about 9 a. m., where the men were breakfasted and the horses fed; after which, feeling confident that the deserters had either left the country, or so did themselves as to make their capture almost impossible that day, I determined to return to Coshocton and await a more favorable opportunity to take them.

I think this fight will have a good effect in this county. Loyal men are fully aroused now to the importance of having the deserters captured, and the deserters and their friends will have learned that arresting parties carry guns and are not afraid to use them. I shall be after them (the deserters) soon again. They have got to come in now or leave the country.

Very truly, yours,

WM. A. JOHNSTON,

Deputy Provost-Marshal for Coshocton County.

P. S.- I must have arms, or an armed party, to do my work with.
