Be it therefore resolved, first, That we, the officers of Breckinridge's division, call the attention of our Congress to the facts, confidently hoping and urgently asking that they may in their wisdom adopt such measures as are necessary for our subsistence, by providing for the issuing to officers rations free of charge.

Resolved, second, That while we are willing to make all needful sacrifices for the sake of the glorious cause in which we are battling, and while we intend to endure unmurmuringly to the end all necessary hardships and privations, we feel that it is not asking too much of our Government to require subsistence at its hands as a remuneration for our services, and we hope that our action will not be viewed as dictatorial, but as an earnest appeal to the wisdom of our legislative department upon a subject which materially affects the welfare not only of ourselves but of the whole country.

Resolved, third, That a copy of these resolutions and preamble be at once forwarded, through the proper channel, to the Senate and House of Representatives of the Confederate States.

At the present prices of provisions the pay of company officers is worth less than that of privates.

ADJUTANT-GENERAL:

I believe a law was passed allowing rations, which I hope will remedy the evil.
