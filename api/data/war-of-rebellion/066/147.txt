The admiral thinks that a combined attack is meditated by the rebels with their iron-clads from the inside, and the Alabama, Florida, &amp;c., from the outside. Their object, he thinks is to cover the exportation of a large quantity of cotton from Darien, Ga. He therefore wishes to go down at once and destroy this cotton, or capture it. This would, of course, secure a large amount of prize-money, but I prefer to cut the railroad first, and then make the other military attempts before attending to the cotton, and I think it will be done in that order.

I am rejoiced to hear the cheering news from General Grant. He certainly will get Richmond now. Lee will retire to the westward as soon as his supplies of ammunition and provisions run low. I am expecting news every hour. Whatever the orders are, whether to send more men to the north or to make active demonstrations with them here, I shall obey them with cheerfulness and carry them out with alacrity.
