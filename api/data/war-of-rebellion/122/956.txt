communicated to you at large under the dates of the 4th and 18th of January and 3rd of February, 1862, and 23rd of November, 1861. There is nothing to present at this time in addition to or modification of them. With respect to permanent defenses on the land frontier of the State, I am not prepared to make any recommendation at present. The Engineer Department cannot recommend the Government to take now any steps involving expenditures toward providing communications to or between the coast defenses of the State. There does not seem to be any military necessity for so doing, the construction of roads being safely left to the demands of business and the enterprise of the people. The subject of floating defenses does pertain to this office.

I have the honor, &amp;c.,

JOS. G. TOTTEN,

Brevet Brigadier-General and Colonel of Engineers.
