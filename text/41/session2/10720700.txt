THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
January 24,
of the Treasury is required to pay off the three
per cent, certificates.
Bach Senator will be interested in the ques-
tion how much his own State will get of this
$40,000,000, and Senators have inquired of me
how it will be divided. There has been some
criticism as to whether or not the terms of the
bill were clear and specific enough to secure a
distribution according to existing law ; and I
have, therefore, caused to be prepared by the
Comptroller of the Currency a statement show-
ing what States will receive this $45,000,000.
In answer to that communication of mine the
Comptroller of the Currency says:
Treasury Depabtment,
Ori'ioe or comptroller of the curkknct,
Washington, I). C., January 20,1870.
Silt: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of
your communication of the 17th instant, and to state
in reply that my construction of the last clause of
section one of a bill to provide a national currcnoy
of coin notes, and to equalize the distribution of cir-
culatingnotes (S. No. 378) is that those States having
less than their proportion according to population
would be entitled to priority over other States in
the supply of bank circulation.
I inclose herewith a statement showing the amount
to which each of the southern States would be enti-
tled under the apportionment of the first $150,000,000,
the amount which has already been furnished to
those States, and the amount necessary to bring those
States upon an equality under such apportionment
with the other States of the Union, from which you
will observe that it will require $25,289,570 to supply
thei>er capita apportionment of those States—leaving
something over nineteen million dollars to be appor-
tioned according to business, banking capital, re-
sources, &c., or to be retained until a new apportion-
ment can be made under the census of 1870.
If it should seem proper to the committee to diroct
which of these courses should be pursued, I shall, of
course, acquicsoe in their judgment.
Very respectfully,
H. K. HULBURD,
Comptroller.
Hon. John Sherman,
Chairman Finance Committee United States Senate.

It appears from the statement that the south-
ern States, in order to make up their share of
the first §150,000,000, will receive $25,289,570.
That will leave $19,000,000 of this increased
circulation to be distributed under the second
clause of the apportionment; that is, to the
Slates according t,o resources, banking cir-
culation, &c., giving to those having the least
first. This will give to the western and south-
ern States, under the rule of apportionment
provided by existing law, some nineteen mil-
lion dollars. Precisely how much it will give
to each State would be difficult to tell at pres-
ent without a careful detailed examination
and comparison of their resources, business
capital, &c. At any rate, §25,289,570 of this
amount would first be distributed to those States
having no circulation at all, or comparatively
none; and the remaining $20,000,000 would be
distributed to the southern and western States.
This is all I desire to say in regard to the
first branch of the bill. The last three sec-
tions of the bill relate entirely to the coin
notes. The committee were of the opinion
that it was better in this bill to inaugurate a
simple general rule by which all associations
whenever located, in all parts of our country
without any limitation as to circulation, might
organize under the banking system to issue
coin notes. The objection may be made that
this will not be made available; but we are
assured from the highest authorities thatbanks
would at once be organized under this system
in the States of California and Oregon, and
in the cities of New York, Charleston, and
New Orleans. No banks would be organized
upon a coin basis with authority to issue coin,
notes unless coin or coin notes are in general
circulation at the place of location of the
banks. As a matter of course, where the
ordinary circulation of the country is filled up
by our national currency notes or greenbacks
<;old notes would not have a ready circulation;
but it is to be remembered that the whole
Pacific coast are now using gold and silver
coin, and they are eager and anxious to avail

themselves of the benefit of banking upon a
gold basis.
We have assurances that banks will be organ-
ized under this system at once on the Pacific
coast to a very large amount, thus unlock-
ing, if you please, a portion of the gold that
must necessarily be used now for the ordinary
channels of circulation. In the city of New
York there is now a commerce going on of
over six hundred million dollars, all of which
is carried on on the gold basis; and so great
is the necessity for paper money to represent
this gold business that they actually deposit
$50,000,000 of gold coin in the Treasury of
the United States, and receive gold notes with-
out interest, merely to facilitate the ordinary
transaction of this great commercial business.
I suppose the transactions between the first
and second dealers in New York based upon
gold notes, upon gold, and upon gold values
is more than one thousand million dollars per
annum. The speculative transactions upon gold
and gold notes have in some cases amounted
to three or four hundred million dollars a day;
but those are mere representative operations
that we do not look to. The actual business
transactions in gold now beingcarried on in the
city of New York represent an aggregate of
business of not less than $1,000,000,000. The
whole foreign commerce in the city of New
York, exports and imports, is about six hun-
dred million dollars, and allowing that mer-
chandise exported and imported passes through
two hands before it becomes assimilated to our
paper currency, the amount of business trans-
actions is probably more than one thousand
million dollars.
So in the cities of Charleston and New
Orleans, where cotton is measured by the gold
standard, they can very readily use these coin
notes, and it will there be a very convenient
agency of exchange for the great production
of cotton. These banks may be organized in
these places, and to the extent that they are
organized tfhey will furnish to the people a sure
currency based upon coin, payable in coin,
having all the requisites that it is possible to
have to provide the best national currency.
I take it, without extending my argument
on this point—for I did not intend to speak
very long, but merely to present these out-
lines—that these coin notes when issued will
present the four essential requisites of a good
currency: first, the absolute security of the
note-holder by the United States; second, the
agency of private corporations or banks to
give flexibility to the currency and to meet the
ebb and flow of exchanges; third, its redemp-
tion in gold coin on demand; fourth, its free-
dom from monopoly or restrictions, except
such as are necessary to protect the creditors
of banks.
These are the only points that are essentially
necessary for the consideration of this bill. I
might now mention a multitude of other topics
that may be drawn into this discussion that are
now being considered by the Committee on
Finance. It seems to me this bill ought to be
kept to these two distinct propositions. If you
attempt, for instance, to regulate the character
of the bonds that should be filed as a security
for the coin notes or the circulating notes you
trespass upon another great domain, the fund-
ing system. Therefore we have organized
these banks upon existing bonds ; and if any
provisions of law should hereafter be made
requiring existing banks to buy a new kind of
bonds as the basis of bank note circulation,
those same provisions of law would apply to
these banks.
So there are a multitude of other questions
that might be drawn into this discussion. The
question of a choice between greenbacks and
bank notes might be drawn into it; but we
have avoided any reference to it because I
believe the judgment of the country is gradu-
ally settling down to the conviction that a note
issued by a Government cannot be a proper
agency of circulation. Other nations as well
as our own have often tried the experiment of
maintaining a circulating note issued by the
Government, and they have uniformly found
it to fail. It is impossible to give a currency
issued by a Government that flexibility neces-
sary to meet the ebb and flow of exchanges ;
and therefore experience has shown that a Gov-
ernment note issued by a Government and
maintained alone upon the guarantee of the
Government does not form a good circulating
medium except during a suspension of specie
payments. It must nave a flexibility, an ebb
and flow which will enable it to be increased
in certain periods of the year, and enable it to
flow back again into the vaults of the banks at
others. I am convinced, although it is unne-
cessary to discuss that point here, that in time
it will be wise to retire our United States notes
and all forms of Government circulation and
depend upon notes issued by private corpora-
tions, amply secured beyond peradventure, so
thatin no case can the note-holder lose, and then
to subject these banks to regulations applicable
to all parts of the country; make them free, so
that the business of banking will be like the
business of manufactures, blacksmithing, or
any other ordinary occupation or business of
life, to be governed by general law.
Mr. DAVIS. I was unfortunately out of the
Chamber when the honorable Senator made the
first part of his remarks on this subject, and I
wish to make a single inquiry of him in rela-
tion to the gold notes. Where are the gold
notes to be redeemed, and what is the assur-
ance that the holder will always have them
redeemed when he presents them ?
Mr. SHERMAN. They are to be redeemed
in the first instance by the bank; but as a mat-
ter of course the United States is the guaran-
tor. The security is the bond of the United
States. They can only get eighty per cent, of
gold notes upon the amountof bonds deposited.
Mr. DAVIS. I understand from the honor-
orable Senator, then, that whenever a gold note
is presented to the counter of a bank, and the
bank refuses to redeem it from its inability to
