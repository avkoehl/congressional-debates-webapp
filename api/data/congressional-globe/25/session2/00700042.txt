DISTRICT Or COLUMBIA
The bul to restiain the issuing of small notes m
the District of Columbia was then taken up
Mr WRIGHT explained the object of this bill,
and suggested that thirty davs would be an appro-
priate period to fill the blank.
Mr. GLAY said that no one more ardentlv de-
sired the resumption of specie payments than him-
self, but he doubted the expediency of forcing the
banks of this District to resume at a period of un-
certainty as to when those of the surrounding coun-
try should adopt such a measure He had that
morning received new-, f>oni New Ycr? of the re-
sumpuon ot another oi the r b inks, and that, taken
in connection with information deru ed of late from
various quarters, inspired him with much strongei
hopes than he had formerly entertained, that the
banks would, at an earl} day, return to spec e pay-
ments throughout the country With regard to
the banks of this District, it was futile to suppose
thit ihey cou'd attempt to pay specie, when those
with whom thty weic so ml maiely connected did
not do so He thcughtthe wisest, as well as the
most prudent step, would be to postpone ihe matter
to an eady period in January—say fust oi second
week—when there might be a similar movement
on the pait of the Baltimore and Richmond banks
Congress could then with mop ecitaint} fix the
line si hen these banks must resume, or ha/e their
charttrs revo fed He thought it wrong for Cun
gress to legislate too hastily for a p°op'e undei its
immediits(bai2 withiut leier-nce to the position
in which they s ood to their neighboring popula-
tion As tht hu'ylajs «ere apnnaohing, (a period
when Cnn¿ie«s w is n it piesim  d to be «nbiect to
anj very grave legislation,) he tnought the banks
mignt be longei indulged, and he hoped, theiefoie,
theie would be little or no oppts 'ion to bis sug-
gestion
Mr WRIGHT remarked, that the District banks
werenevei auihonzed Ly the r charters to issue
notes of a less denomination th¿tn five dollars
Now, however, it had become their hab t, in com-
mon with mdiv duals, to issue notes liom twentj-
five to mx and a fourth cents "Shin plasters" (a
distinguishing term, and o le he disliked as much
as any one eise) had been r<"ce-~sanly Used for
change, beoause the people had in a measure been
forced to do so, by the suspension of these banks,
but this small money business he believed was car-
r:jr               i   ■      ,     "          .....,,„^,'«..u;   '    niinut
ned to a greater extent in this district than in any
other portion ot our country The honorable Se-
nator from Kentucky, in his remarks, thtew
out the idea that the banks of this ¿is-
tuct were dependent on their relative position
with/tho^e in Maryland and Virginia for resump-
tion' Suppose the ca3e was reversed, and the Le-
gislatures of those States depended on the action of
Congress to force the banks of this District to re-
sume, uader forfeiture cf their charters at what
future period should we look for so desirable a result.
Mr. W had review ed this subject m his own mind,
in every light, and had come to the conclusion that
the banks here should resume on the 1st of May
next, or be made to suspend operations altogether.
He could see no reason why it should be longer de-
ferred Should the action of Congress be postponed
to a future day, when the period fixed by ¡awshould
arrive, the banks might ask Why was it postponed?
Here we have only some thuty or forty days' notice
given us, whereas, had the law passed at a proper
time, we should have been prepared
Mr CLAY said he could see no good reason why
Congress should not extend a corresponding cour-
tesy to the District banks, with that of the Legisla-
tures of the several States to ihsir moneyed institu-
tions Would it not be better to postpone the day
11 a later period, when the Legislatures of Virginia
and Maryland would be in session, and an oppor-
tunity afforded of witnessi-g the action of those
bodies on the matter?
With regaid to thesp small bills, if immediately
suppressed, what was to be done' There was no
silver to supply the vacuum, and members of Con-
gress had found this small money very convenient
on many occasions Hackmsn, waiters and others
could not be dispensed with, and without this kind
of change, how could their servics be requited?
Ano her objeclioiable fi^tuie in the bill was, that
it impose I a pena t} <Ji .t o i ihe stranger
and citizen, for the passage of these bil's, whe-
ther issued here, or brought from abroad He
had m rm purse notes from one dollar down
to six cents, originating m the different places
through which he had parsed from Newport, Ken-
tucky, to Washington city, m the Dis'rict of
Columbia, in fact, business could not progress
without them And would it not be a legal impo-
sition on a stranger to pass this bill with such
provisions'* Could it be expected that a stranger
pacing through this small space of ten miles
squar , could stop lo mqune into our laws'* nor
wculd a traveller once suspect the danger jn offer-
ing a note, tne iasue of a neighboring Stale, in
change, of being pursued by a constable, and
arrested on a writ
If the chauman of the Committee on Finance
could onlv throw into the District a sufficient sup-
ply of silver change, he (Mr C ) w ould go with
him hand and heart m the annihilation of these
substitutes, but it was rather hard, after the experi-
ment had deprived us of our suostantial currency,
that we should be deprived also of tne only substi-
tute Mr C thought great caution was necessary
in pursuing this subject, and he hoped it would be
postponed until the second week m January, and
made a motion to that efT=ct
Mi BENTON objected to the postponement
The argument was to postpone both bills.—the
shin planter bill, and the bank bill,—and that not
to i certain day, but mdefi utely, and until adjoin-
ing States shoult fust act upon the same subjects
Th s was the argument of the Senator fiom lien-
tuck} (Mr Clay) His notion was- foi a post-
ponement until the second Monday m January,
but the argument was for indefinite postponement,
and for contingent action, and it was evident, from
the two speeches just made by that Senator, (Mr
Clay,) tnat if the postponement < as granted, that
another w ould be demande 1 when it w-s out, for
the w hole tenor of h s tv o speeches was, that the
shin plasters wc-s  not to be suppressed, nor the
bank m this Dis'rict required to resume, until the
adjacent States had first led the wa} in the same
work This was in iefinite postponement, and
contingent action. It was the attempt to do here
precisely what had been effected by the party op-
posed to resumption in the bank convention St
