hi idled—after having ptostrated every branch of industry and
enterprise, the commerce and credit of the nation, by practising
wild and visionary exoetnnents—cuts loose from the people,
and tells them it h is no power to grant them relief, or interfere
with then concerns1 They are to be dismissed with a lectuie
on economy Yes, sir, they are con emp uously tu'd that they
arc to look to then own ludustiy an! frugality i n íehef, without
the aid of the Government' Sir, this reminds me of the Ian
guage of Job's comfoitcis We read m Holy Writ, thaton a
ceitam occasion Satan was permuted by the Almighty to try
an "experiment" upon the firmness and integrity oi "Job, a
peifeet and. an upright man one that feared Goi and eschewed
evil," that when, by th" power of this arch enemy of the peace
and happiness of man, J  b's fot tunes and his children, and
every th ng that w is c<*lcui ted to rende i him hippy, had been
driven to the four winds, and ho was i educed to beggary and
rum, when, m ad htion to this, " he was smittc i with sore boil3
from the crown of his he id to the sole o! his font," aid was
gioamng under the bi terest asomes of human affliction, when,
in short, by one calam ty upon the heels of another, lie had
been rethicad fiom the highest stale ot piospti uy and happi-
ness, to th-1 lowest depths of degiadatrou an I ninety, and wis
wont to roll himstlf m the ashes upon his hearth, there was but
une íesource left upon earth he tould 'onk for consolation and
solace—and that was, his wife \.nd when he cried out to her,
m the bitterness ot histoid what washer reply* bhe toll him
hehadbettei "curse God and die'' And, sir, pretty much in
keeping with this is the President's, consolation to the peop'e in
their afflictions
Sir, do you imagine the people expected to hear such Ian
guajeas this from those to whose interests they have shown
so much devotion'' Did they expect then rulers to mock at
their calamities, which they themselves have been mst.ru men
tal in bringing upon them? No sir, ihuy looked to those whom
they had place! in power to device some means *n relieve
them fiom their c tlamtues The proclamation ol the President
was hailed with j iy by thousands a"! a lavoiabie omen They
hugged to their bosoms the dc'usive hope that then j uiers had
seen the folly of then course, and weie ibout to retíale men
steps Su, although the President was pledged to(tieadgenerit
ly in the ioo stepsorhiy illustr oub predecesor, 'yet, I imagine,
no one believed hedosigiel to dead speci illy mm ío)tstpp«¡
And it was hoped ihi if hedid tieal m his footsteps at all he
would take his ' ba< k tiack," (if Í may be allowed to use a him
tec's phrase,) at least m relation to thecuiieney and the le
venue But, m all this, how saJiy aie we disappointed' So
fat fiom this, we fiid him disposed to plunge still nJ epei mto
new a^d untried expeiirneEitís' Su, what do we behold"* The
wh >le country involved m on p wide- pical nun, and the Go
vernment itself bankrupt, and we are yet to haveauo hci 'ex

Sir, wc find that the ex Piesident is not content with having
dictated to the people whom they s lould choose to be his sue

I had hoped Mr Spealvir, that, as*the President had attained
the summit ol his wishes, he would kut fiom undei him the

V>arbaiity Indeed sn, I look upon commerce as the nam
source and fountan from which all our prosperity and sreaE
nees flow    Where, sir, is an instance of a i ation attaining te
any tUtinctitm oi gieitness, where Commerce has not been
eneouid^ed'i If theie is one, it has escaped ray observation
Why, then, snould we not afford the facilities necessary to sus-
tain this enterprising clabs of our citizens? It isa fact, umvej
s dly conceded by a'l who know any thing ofcommeicial opera-
tions, that t ie men hints do not beai the loss sustained foi want
of these ficiluies, an I tli it it ultimately falls upon the laboring
clasps H cinnot be expected by any reasonable man that
the merchants can buy and sell goods lor nothing They aie
compelled to make a moderate pioftt, and, consequently, all
expenses mcuned by them for want of proper commercnl
facihtie , they iuuu of necessity charge upon the goodb, and
ultimately iheconsumei pa)sit So we discover that it i¡> the
1 ihonns clas&es, ' tne democracy of numbers,"so muck talked *
off in this House, whose interest demands a sound and uniform
currency thiou t\ out the Un ted States
The powet of Con^ie^s to supply the country with some
sort of national cu.iejcy that isumfounthionghout ti 6 Union,
m oidei to assist the domestic exchanges of the country, Í he-
heve ha& been admitted, and even insisted upon, by eveiy
Administration, irom the foundation of the Government down
to the last The fust chaise which Geneial Tackson ever pie
feired ag mist the United States Bank was, that it had failed to
fulfil the expectations ol the people and the object of its ciea
tion, viz tft lutiush the countiy with a sound and uniform cur-
rency, but in this I think h° was mistakeu The present Chief
Migistrdtc, however, 'with the lights now before him," has
determined that ConsiesH hoo no such power But, sn, I think
he must have read through magic spectacles, and will have to
readagain He suiely will not be sustained by the r< presenta
uves of the people m a position so unprecedented and absuid
Admitting then, as it study must be, that Congress not only has
the power, but that it is om indispensable duty, to supply the
countiy wi h a national cuirency and medium of exchange,
the question naturally arises, how is this to be accomplished^
Did any man ever s~uoiis|y believe that the commeice and
trade of thi& gieat nation could be cairied on by an exclusive
metallic currency? I answer, no, this question is too clear to
admit of controversy In the next place, sir, aie the State
banksable t> furnish audi i cunency? Of this I shall leave
evdy man to be his own ludge, but, judging for myself, if there
be any thing m past experience, I should say it is most clcai
an 1 manifest they cannot, Then, sn, the great and important
question comes up What will accomplish this end? By one
set of pohticims, sn, a national bank is said to be the only
institution capable of supplying tins cuuency, and past expe
ríen e is qu >ted as nuomcsiable evidence in support of this
po&Uion, while on the other hind, it is most vehemently d<*
nouncej as both unconstitutional and dangerous to hbeity
These, ¡sil, ai ft grive md weighty objections, ii well founded,
an 1 if iny o lu m^ans can be devised t > accomohsh tUi° end
\rihln ill h in ti mi c( ,snt!i i >ni| ob|ectun arllc*sd n
guous to lnei j I wi 1 most gially einbiacc   'Vnd, sir, I
toncuc witli the konoiable gentleman ,iom South Carolina,
(Mr Rhett,) that, unless the country be supplied with such a
currency by other means, it will not take the people Jong to
lemove all constitutional scruple  out of the way oía national
bank As foi myself, sir, Ido not believe that either ofthe ob
jections to a national bank is well founded I have nevei
dmbted the power of Congress to charter su<*h an institution
But if I had, I should considei myself a most egregious bigot
weie I to set up my judgment against all the piecedentb on
this point Indeed, sn, I believe this is a question that cannot
now be raised ¿vith anyptopuety It has been twice deter
mme l, aftei the most deliberate investigation oy eveiy depait
ment of this Government, Legislative, Executive, and iudicial
And I am one of those, sir, whobepeve that the Constitution in
as susceptible of h nig reduced to fixed md settled principles
as any othei I iw ol the land If it is loi ever to remato an un
settled text, and is to be one thing to day, and another to mm
iow, and another again the next day, just to suit the whim anl
capuce ofthe powers that be, I think we had better surrender
the instrument We had bettei have no Constitution, than to
have it the merecreatme of those m power, to administer as
they may choose to understand it
And is to the other objection, I thmk it is equally futile Sup
pose we admit that the late Butk of the United States had been
guilty ol th„ neatest etime with which it was charged—that of
¡ntei meddling m elections, and using Us means toacquuc politi
ral powet *sii, does that luimsn anyargument why anothei
shonl 1 not b cnaiteicd, with such guards and restiletions
thiown aiouni it asm prevent a recunence of those evils?
Most ceitnily not We might wi h as much propriety say
tn tt, because the late Piesideutoi ihe United Statesmteifeie I
in the elee km of his sucees oi ni i hi ought the power and
pattoiider of his ofhee into confín t with the fieedom of^iec
tions, we ought theieiore to abolish the Executive Dep irimem
of this Government buch an aiguinent is absurd and pie
poste rous
And sii, I avail myself of this o casion to express my firm
behtf that a national b ink, based up-iu coneet principles, i&
die (tnlv institunon ipab t ot giving the countiy sucha cur
renev as is cs enti il to its prosperity And I am sustained in
this minion by this lemaikable fact, that dunng the space of
about, forty yens while t,uüi an institution was m operation m
h s < ountiy there was never, it my time, a material derange

it from mgh authority, and from different sources too, that a
