undersigned have had presented to them from time to time various claims for settlement, which they could not, under their sense of legal duty, allow, but which nevertheless were not without merit. These they will submit hereafter in a special communication. They ask an examination of their expenditures, and for this purpose their books and vouchers are subject to inspection. They are of opinion that as the Provisional Army has been turned over to the Confederate Government, together with all the supplies on hand, there is no longer any necessity for a military and financial board, and that it can and ought to be dispensed with for the future. They respectfully suggest that a commissioner be appointed without delay to settle with all the various officers who have been charged with the expenditure of the money. It is important that this be done speedily, in order to expedite a settlement with the Confederate Government and to reimburse the State. The books of the undersigned show to whom money was paid from time to time, and all that remains is for the persons to whom the sums were issued to furnish vouchers for the expenditure.

In conclusion, the undersigned cannot forbear to acnowledge the prompt and generous response made to their appeal by the people of the State in furnishing supplies of clothing and other necessaries to the soldiers in the field. Aside from the consideration of the timely and material aid to those who are fighting our battles and struggling with disease, it has inspired new courage and confidence in the hearts of all true friends of Southern independence. Who can doubt the success of a cause that finds such ardent and universal support among both sexes and in all conditions of life? When a free people can rise up to the sublime height of not only professing but practicing the motto of "All for the public and nothing for selft," they can never ben conquered. A continuation of this same spirit is respectfully and solemnly invoked during this momentous struggle. Lrces, physical, moral, and intellectual, be brought to bear by one mighty effort against the enemies of our rights and of American freedom, and it will require no gift of prophecy to predict a speedy and glorious termination to this unhappy conflict. The undersigned submit their action to your inspection and judgment, with the consciousness of having endeavored to do their duty to the utmost of their power, but with a regret that they could not be more useful in preparing and sustaining the State in her great hour of trial.

With high respect, your obedient servants,

NEILL S. BROWN.
