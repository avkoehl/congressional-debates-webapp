burned by our troops last night. Your body guard-Ford's cavalry-are reported to have run in the most disgraceful manner. Have ordered McKean to send a brigade to sustain the Chewalla command and feel the enemy if he comes in sight.

Major-General.

CORINTH, October 1, 1862.

General GRANT:

Report from Chewalla, 4 p. m., infantry and cavalry force of rebels appeared south of Tuscumbia, at Young's Bridge. If they advance on Bethel, Stanley, from position near Kossuth, can cut off their retreat; or if he should be wanted with me, Hurlbut can do the same.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.

CORINTH, October 1, 1862.

General GRANT:

Du Bois withdrawn from Rienzi to Danville. Cavalry regiment camped at Ruckersville, between Clear Creek and Jacinto. No news from Lee's reconnaissance supported by two regiments of infantry. Stanley not yet reported himself in position. Hamilton's division concentrated, and Davies and McKean on Chewalla road, except Crocker, who is near here. How far are the rebels advancing? Demonstration on Chewalla amounted to nothing.

HEADQUARTERS FIFTH DIVISION,Memphis, October 1, 1862.

Honorable JOHN PARK, Mayor of Memphis:

SIR: Your letter of September 29 inclosing two letters from John P. Trevesant, clerk, dated September 12, is received.* I prefer not by any action of mine to complicate the machinery of government, and therefore will not sanction the imperfect collection of county and State taxes by a deputy or clerk.

If the county authorities return to their allegiance and duty I will be willing to assist them, but to empower a deputy to collect State taxes, even if these taxes be paid into the city treasury, will give a man in whom I have not full confidence the power to disturb the merchants and business men of the city without extending his collections on the county. I prefer that the city authorities should execute their powers vigorously, not timidly; suppress crimes, keep your streets guarded, lighted, and cleaned, and to extend this authority to all who enjoy the advantages of the city.

If the founds derived from the taxes hitherto provided for are insufficient report to me, and I can levy any species of military contributions. I think it better to have the taxes due the State and county in the hands of the people till the government of the county and State resume their appropriate functions. I return to your the letter of Mr. Trevesant.

I am, with great respect, your obedient servant,

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
