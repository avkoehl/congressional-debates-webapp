The Board of Survey, Captain J". II, Strong, Chief
Engineers B.F. Garvin and Edwin Fithian, reported,
April 26, 1869, that they estimated the cost to the
contractors to complete the contracts to be the
amounts which would be due them on completion of
those contracts, except the sixty-inch engine, which
would cost about fifteen thousand dollars.
As Corliss delivered the engines in exactly the
same condition they were in when the board ex-
amined them, according to report of the board, the
department should have settled with Corliss as
follows:
From the above sum which would have been due
Corliss on the completion of the one hundred inch
engine $177,068 25
Should have been deducted wnatit would
have cost him to complete it  140,000 00

inch engine -  37,068 25

inch engine on completion...$126,549 15

recommended in the report.. 15,000 00

ty-inch engine  111,549 15
143,617 40
Deduction as above  929 40
1 Amount for which Corliss should have
received a certificate  147,088 00
Amount for which Corliss actually re-
ceived a certificate, which he now holds,
and to pay which Congress is asked for
an appropriation  257,088 00
Gratuity which Corliss will receive from ^
the United States  $110,000 00
The correctness of the foregoing statement
is more fully proved by examining the report
of tlie board of officers appended to the reply
of the Secretary to the Senate resolution. The
report of the board contains the following:
"The following is a list of the engines and the
amounts due on contracts and reservations upon
completion:
Daniel McLeod, balance on reservation for one pair
60-inch by 36-mch engines    $30,000 00
John Roach, balancc on reservation for
Corliss Steam-Engine Company, balance •
three pairs 60-inch by 26-inch engines.. 90,000 00
on contract for one pair 60-inch by 06-
inch engines 
Extra bills on same  11,d49 lo
Corliss Steam-Engine Company, balance
due on contract for one pair 100-inch
engines  Si-
Extra bills on same  7,vW 2d
Total      &378.617 40
"We estimate the cost to the contractors to com-
plete the contracts to be the amount now due them,
except upon the 00-inch by 36-inch engines at the
Corliss Steam-Engine Company, which would cost
about $15,000. i A a *
"Should these contracts be completed as fa-r as
thev can be, with a view to storing them in navy-
vards, there would be a deduction on each ol the 60
fcv36-inoh engines of about $15,000, and upon the
100-inch engine of about $50,000, making a total re-
duction of $125.000; leaving a balance, after deduct-
in" the cost of extra work in erecting the 100-inch
engine, of $299,063 40 to be paid by tne Government
for storing thorn."
The meaning of the report is unmistakable.
As applicable to the one hundred inch engines
of Corliss, it declares :
1. That there would be due Corliss, upon
their full completion and erection in the vessel,
according to the contract, the sum of $140,000.
2. That it would cost Corliss the a mount
that would be due him on completion; namely,
$140,000, to complete the engines.
3. That should the engines be completed^ so
far as they could be without actually erecting
them in the vessel, and then delivered and
stored in the navy-yard, there should be de-
ducted $50,000. lo/ii-v
It is not disputed that after April 26, 1869,
when this report was made, the Navy Deparfc-
mert received the engines in the same condi-
tion they were in when the board examined
them, and gave Corliss a certificate, which he
now holds, for $257,688. To arrive^at these
figures the Department deducted from the
$700,000, which would have been the fall price
on completion of the one hundred inch engines,
only $30,000 for non-completion.
According to the reportof the board, clearly
the Department, receiving the engines in the
same condition as when the board examined
them, should have deducted $140,000—tac
amount which it would have actually cost Cor-
liss to complete them. These conclusions seem
too plain for argument.
But there are additional facts which further
conclusively prove that $140,000 or more should
have been deducted:
First. Since the adoption of the Senate reso-
lution, Commodore Strong and Chief Engineer
Garvin, members of the board, being recalled
by the Department, have reported that it was
their intention so to deduct in their first report.
This second report the Department has not
seen fit to send to the Senate.
Second. In settling with the other two con-
tractors for engines, mentioned in their report,
the Department received the engines unfin-
ished and deducted the full amount reported
by the board as the necessary cost of their
completion. Only in the case of Corliss's one
hundred inch engines is a less deduction made.
Third. By the original contract, Corliss, for
$700,000 and an allowance of $30,000 for
transportation, was to complete and erect the
one hundred inch engines in the ship. By
delivering the engines to the Government in
the state of completion in which the board
found them, Corliss actually saved himself the
expenditure of $250,123 19 accurately com-
puted, as follows:

The foregoing facts so clearly prove that
either through mistake or fraud a settlement
was made involving a loss of $110,000 more
or less to the Government, that until the reply
of the Secretary it was not to be doubted that
the Navy Department, upon attention bemg
called to the error, would promptly rectify it.
Such was evidently the first intention ot the
Department. After the passage of the Senate
resolution the Department called upon Corliss
to return the certificate for $257,688. This
Corliss has refused to do, and by some repre-
sentations has induced the Secretary to send
his reply to the Senate indorsing the settle-
ment and stating that the Department feels
bound to pay Corliss the $257,688.
This reply of the Secretary is full of erro-
neous statements. Its fundamental aud most
important misstatement is this: that it takes
the amount which the board reported would
be due Corliss if he "finished the engines and
erected them in the vessel," instead of _ the
figures applicable to a delivery of the engines
at the navy-yard in the condition they were in
when the board saw them, and in whicjji con-
dition they were actually delivered tjpthe Gov-
ernment.
Such an artifice ought not to have^ been
expected from any official source. It is un-
worthy of the Secretary of the Navy. It will
deceive nobody. After reading the reply of
the Department examine the extracts which I
have given from the report of the board, par-
ticularly the three lines preceding the quota-
tions given by the Department, which Knesare
improperly and unfairly omitted by the Depart-
ment. The board estimates the cost to the con-
tractors to complete the contracts to be the
amount which would be due them on comple-
tion. Could there have been any doubt as to
the correct mode of settlement with Corliss if
the Department agreed to receive from him the
one hundred inch engines, as stated in his offer,
" in their present state of completion?" Evi-
dently the Department should have deducted
at least $140,000, the amount which the board
reported it would have cost the contractors to
complete them; and, according to the figures
which I have given, they should have deducted
$250,000 if they did not want to pay Corliss a
profit on work not done.
