the result of your expedition. You will procure what information you can of the enemy and the condition of the crossings of the Chickahominy. You will take the usual supply of rations and forage.

H. C. WHIPPLE,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.

WINCHESTER, VA., January 29, 1865.

Honorable EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

The following dispatch just received from Loudoun County, where Mr. Foote now is. I have declined to receive any communication from Mr. Foote on the subject of his mission:

LOVETTSVILLE, January 29, 1865.

Brevet Brigadier-General FORSYTH,

Chief of Staff:

Would it be improper or advisable to inform Major-General Sheridan by telegraph of the special nature of the proposition Mr. Foote desires to make to the authorities of Washington, and also the parties for whom he is authorized to speak? Mr. Foote insists that if this should be done it would have some influence on his detention.

THOS. C. DEVIN,

Brigadier-General.

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington, January 29, 1865.

Major-General SHERIDAN:

If Mr. Foote desires to transmit any communication to any person at Washington he may place it under seal, and deliver it to any officer of your staff whom you may designate, to be delivered according to its address at Washington, Mr. Foote remaining in custody where he now is until further orders from the President, but holding no communication with any one upon his business.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington, D. C., January 28 [29], 1865-12.30 a. m.

JOHN W. GARRETT, Esq.,

Baltimore:

I have received a letter from the Secretary of the Treasury urging that something be done to keep the gas-works supplied with coal. There is much alarm lest the light be stopped for want of coal. Please prevent this, if possible, and, if necessary, cut off all but military transportation.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.
