his flanks and trains, which should be harassed. We have more than a month's provisions and a large well-appointed army, and can operate from this point. General Grant has ordered large reserves to Nashville, and General Thomas is there to manage them.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

ROME, GA., October 1, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN:

No infantry force discovered yet. I send in every direction and obtain no authentic information of any large of either cavalry or infantry within twenty-five miles of this point. Hood not arrived at Blue Mountain day before yesterday. Cars still run there.

JNO M. CORSE,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

ROME, October 1, 1864-10 p. m.

Major-General SHERMAN:

I have had two or three spies in to-day from Villa Rica; came through Buchanan, Cedartown, and Cave Spring, and say no great force at those points, only a few scouts. They could learn nothing of Hood's moving on Blue Mountain nor of infantry at Carrollton. Reports through the country, they say, are very conflicting; in fact, no one knows where the army is or where it is going. Another spy reported to-day that a cavalry force was moving around WEST of me, as if to strike the railroad above Resace. They all agree as to the fact of three being no large force of troops at or near or north of Blue Mountain. They all seem to be puzzled as to Hood's movements, and some, I am confident, are honest in their ignorance. I will have more in to-morrow and let you know further. I am ready to co-operate with Smith in the event you speak of.

JNO M. CORSE,

Brigadier-General.
