The number who were lcilled in action or
died of wounds received there aggregate ex-
actly six thousand commissioned officers and
seventy-four thousand three hundred enlisted
men, making in all eighty thousand three hun-
dred brave men. Glorious eighty thousand
three hundred! The American people should
plant evergreens upon your graves and water
them with tears of sorrow for your fall. It is
due here to saythat Congress provided a fund
to enable the War Department to gather from
all places where they could be traced the
bodies of our fallen comrades, and under its
excellent management they have been raised
for more decent interment in gravps prepared
for that purpose in well-assigned and closely-
guarded eemeieries.

Many, indeed most of these, had served in
battle, but after passing safely through the
dangers of the lield, fell in that much more
dangerous spot, an Army hospital.
If this mclancholy mortuary record could
stop here, I would congratulate you that,
severe though it was, it was not too much for
what it saved to mankind. Nor do I intend
to say that all it did cost was not well spent.
But when we are traveling on a long journey,
in which sorrows and misfortunes are pressing
us on every hand, the miles seem lengthened
and their numbers multiplied. So it is with
this recital. But it eannol stop here. On
and on it goes with numbers added painful to
contemplate; yet it is just fo consider, and
worthy oar closest attention and most solemn
and sacred respect and remembrance.

Nor is this all that death demanded. We
now enter upon the fifth record, more dismal
and drear. Such cases occurring in our neigh-
borhood touch us with sorrow. This record
has awakened in me a feeling of deep sorrow.

Thus the mortuary records of the Union Army
may be summed up. Between the 12th day of
April, 1861, and the 30th day of April, 1865,
being fori r y ears and eighteen days, there were—

Making 9,314 commissioned officers and
385,102 enlisted men, in all, 294,410 martyrs
to civil and religious liberty and equal rights
to all persons before the law—a terrible mar-
tyrdom, but voluntarily made. It has been
said that " the blood of the martyr is the seed
of the church." It may be as truthfully as-
serted that the blood ot these martyrs is the
seed of the Republic.
This day our glorious banner, with its stars
and stripes unsullied and undiminished, floats
to the breeze in the full light of heaven, with
every stain of nationalized oppression washed
out of it in the warm life-blood of the nation's
devoted children, who became a voluntary
sacrifice for her honor and defense.
The deaths in the Union Army may prop-
erly be classed by the character of the troops
in this way:

Passing from these general statistics to
speak of the personal treatment of prisoners
of war by the rebel authorities I will first
give you—
1. The number of Union prisoners captured
by the rebels.
2. Those who died in captivity.
3. Those legally paroled and exchanged.
4. Those illegally paroled.
5. Those who escaped.
0. Those recaptured by our forces.
7. Those who abandoned our flag and joined
the rebel army.

The Secretary of War suggested that the
number of deaths, as drawn from the books to
the date of his report, March 1, 1869, being
26,828, was too small by twenty per cent, on
that amount. But it fully justifies the increase
to thirty-eight per cent, on his figures, for the
reason that the burial parties sent by the War
Department have discovered, raised, and re-
interred 36,401 bodies of Union prisoners of
war in the sixty-eight places of burial; and
even this number should be increased, as the
records when completed will sho#. At least
this number cannot be too large, though it
may be too small.

7. The number who joined the enemy.
This brings me to the most unpleasant part
of this record. It is to give you the number
of those prisoners who, in the hour of their
extremity, abandoned our standard and joined
the rebel army. Of these there were nine
commissioned officers and 3,161 enlisted white
men, making in all 3,170. There was not one
colored soldier who, while a prisoner of war,
joined the enemy. It is just to state this,
for, though uneducated, they were universally
loyal, and could always he trusted to the full"
extent of their inforniation.
Ill treating upon the subject of Union pris-
oners joining the enepiy, our censure should
go out well seasoned with charity. We must
not forget this" was a civil war. Many north-
ern soldiers had friends and relatives in the
South—fathers, mothers, brothers, and sis-
ters and when captured were thr@wn among
them and thus induced to join the enemy.
Again, many had been raised in the South
and were still laboring under those prejudices
which attach to less informed men. Some
were recently from foreign countries, not fixed
in their devotion to either side of the contest,
and were raoie inclined to accept the one
presenting at the time the fairest prospect;
like a traveler caught in a storm, seeking the
first shelter which offers hito protection, with
little inquiry as to title. With such persons
the cruelties ,of rebel prisons would soon com-
