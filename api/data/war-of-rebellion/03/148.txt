insulting of citizens, searching of houses, except you may find it necessary, and then let it be done by persons specially detailed for the purpose. Keep four days' provisions at least on hand, and be ready to move the column at any time it may be ordered. You will not probably leave where you are until General Prentiss has gone to Saint Louis, and maybe until his return. Should the cavalry horses or mules require shoeing, have it done while you are lying still.

Lieutenant S. L. PHELPS, Commanding Gunboat Conestoga:

Heavy cannonading being reported south of here, you will proceed with all dispatch, and render such assistance as your disposable means can afford. Should the alarm prove false, you will return immediately and report.

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

CAIRO, ILL., September 4, 1861.

On advice of Commander Rodgers I have ordered the withdrawal of troops from Belmont until such time as the column from Jackson may move. I have no accurate information of the strength of the rebels at Sikeston, but hope to have to-day.

U. S. GRANT,

Brigadier-General.

Major General JOHN C. FREMONT, Saint Louis, Mo.

CAIRO, ILL., September 4, 1861.

SIR: The prompt execution of your plan by the troops under my command having been defeated by General Prentiss' withdrawal from the command at Jackson and delaying the movement of that column, and the representation of Commander Rodgers as to the efficiency of the rebel inland navy, coupled with the impossibility of making a retreat from Belmont, except by falling back into the country as far as Charleston, and the weakness of the force at Belmont, makes me deem it advisable to withdraw the troops from that point until the command assumes shape for concert of action. Orders have been given accordingly. From information gathered from the rebel district I inclose you reports of Colonel McArthur* and Colonel Waagner,# reserving copies. As fast as information is received I will keep you informed by telegraph.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

U. S. GRANT,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Major General JOHN C. FREMONT,

Commanding Dept. of the West, Saint Louis, Mo.
