manufactured in sufficient quantity and that it is properly distributed. As the contest is now daily going on, our success depends as much upon the active operation of our troops and the expenditure of ammunition as it every does on a field of battle. Daily casualties are reducing both armies, and our object should be to cause double, treble, or quadruple the number of casualties in the enemy's lines that they cause in ours. I feel satisfied I can do this on my line if I am supplied with ammunition; at least, if supplied with ammunition, I shall be able to bring to bear a great amount of human energy and activity which now lies idly wasting away under the enemy's fire. I may also be permitted to state the fact that whilst we husband our ammunition and the enemy are thinning our ranks with comparative impunity-our men being compelled simply to suffer and endure-a moral effect is being produced which may prove very detrimental to our future success. I hope and implore that all the human energy in our workshops may be at once brought into successful action, and I think we can confidently and securely answer for the result in the field. I would also suggest that our artillery, guns and mortars, so far as employed, inflict loss and annoyance on the enemy's front line. While we see within our reach their troops resting securely in the rear, or engaged actively in firing or other measures of attack on our lines, we need ammunition to be used freely on all lines within our reach.

The following list of casualties is respectfully submitted: Elliott's brigade, killed, 2; wounded, 3. Ransom's brigade, wounded, 4. Wise's brigade, killed, 1; wounded, 10. Total, 3 killed and 17 wounded.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

B. R. JOHNSON,

Major-General.

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS JOHNSON'S DIVISION, July 16, 1864.

COLONEL: Colonel Goode, commanding Wise's brigade, relieved the two left regiments of Elliott's brigade at 8 p. m. yesterday; he reports nothing of interest during the night. Colonel Faison, commanding Ransom's brigade, and Brigadier-General Elliott report no change in the situation, and only the usual amount of sharpshooting and shelling. General Gracie feels confident that the line which the enemy have been running toward his line has not been extended more than fifteen feet from their rifle-pits. The Yankee officer of the day requested permission to bury three of their dead last night. The men were killed in their advanced skirmish line. The Yankee pickets told General Gracie's last night that Baltimore was in possession of the rebels; they still decline to exchange papers.

The following casualties are respectfully submitted: Elliott's brigade, killed, 1; wounded 5 (1 shot accidentally). Ransom's brigade, killed, 1; wounded, 2. Gracie's brigade, killed, 1; wounded, 5 (4 of the 5 wounded were shot by carelessly exposing their persons). Total, 3 killed and 12 wounded.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,B. R. JOHNSON,

Major-General.

Colonel G. W. BRENT,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
