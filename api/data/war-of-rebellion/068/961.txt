ON PLANK ROAD NEAR BROCK ROAD, May 6, 1864-1.30 p.m.

Lieutenant General R. S. EWELL,

Commanding Corps:

GENERAL: General Lee bids me say that he has received your note mentioning the cavalry raid. He hopes you can repulse it, but wishes you to communicate with General W. H. F. Lee, if possible, and though he has a long line, he may be able to send something on your left to prevent such movements. One of our lines is now parallel to the Orange plank road, and fighting with the enemy. The enemy are said to be passing back from the east.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. S. VENABLE,

Aide-de-Camp.

MAY 6, 1864-10 a.m.

Major-General STUART,

Commanding, &amp;c.:

GENERAL: Your dispatch is received, and the commanding general directs me to say that he approves of your designs, and wishes you success. General Ewell has repulsed all attacks this morning, and Longstreet holds our line of yesterday afternoon. The enemy is making no headway.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. MARSHALL,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Aide-de-Camp.

MILFORD, May 6, 1864.

General STUART:

I move with Gordon's and Wright's toward Shady Grove. Will be near Bethany Church to-night.

WADE HAMPTON,

Major-General.

MAY 6, 1864.

Major-General STUART:

I have no good reason for thinking I was fighting infantry, save from the number and manner of firing and reports of officers.

Respectfully,

J. B. GORDON,

Brigadier-General.

ON THE OLD TURNPIKE, May 6, 1864-2.30 p.m.

General GORDON:

GENERAL: Ramseur reports that the enemy is withdrawing from his right flank toward our left, and it is thought they may be massing there. General Ewell directs me to ask for any information you can give.

Respectfully, &c.,

A. S. PENDLETON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
