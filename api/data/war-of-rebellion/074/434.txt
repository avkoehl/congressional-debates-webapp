a position on the right of Sixty-sixth Indiana Infantry in a dense thicket of pines. As directed, ordered Company C to deploy and advance to cover the right flank of my command. Second Iowa Infantry being assigned a position on my right, I immediately recalled Company C and sent out Company I, Lieutenant Doty commanding, to cover the front of the regiment. This company passed through the pine thicket to the edge of an open field and soon became engaged with the enemy. Having a fair view and good range their fire was effective. No other portion of the command became engaged, although more or less exposed to the enemy's five while getting into position, sustaining a loss of 2 wounded. In twenty minutes after getting into position the command had constructed formidable rail-works, behind which the men could take cover. The battle over, men continued to strengthen the works until they were made strong and formidable.

September 1, regiment remained in works. Company I remained on skirmish line until 1 a. m., when relieved by Company K. During the advance of skirmish line early in the morning Company I captured and delivered to my headquarters 10 prisoners and 3 Enfield rifles, which I delivered to your headquarters. In compliance with your orders I made a detail to bury the enemy's dead in my front. Sergeant in charge reported that he buried 3 commissioned officers and 14 privates. During the advancement of the skirmish line on the morning of September 2 Company K, Captain Barto commanding, captured 3 prisoners, 1 lieutenant and 2 privates, all of whom I sent to your headquarters. Captain Barto also reports capturing 15 stand of arms, which he destroyed; being under orders to advance he could not remove them from the field. The regiment marched late, morning of September 2, following Captain Welker's battery, to Jonesborough, rejoining brigade at that place. After a short tarry at Jonesborough the march was renewed toward Lovejoy's, where the enemy was found in force. Bivouacked in rear of Seventeenth Army Corps early in the afternoon. Remained in this bivouac until 2 p. m. September 3, when the regiment marched to the front line on the right of Seventeenth Army Corps, and was then assigned a position on the left of First Brigade, connecting with the right of Second Brigade; men immediately commenced to construct breast-works of rails and earth.

Throughout the entire campaign the conduct of both officers and men under the most trying circumstances has been commendable and truly praiseworthy. Without making particular mention of any I am free to acknowledge that the cheerful manner in which the arduous duties of the soldier has been performed, and the spirit of forbearance manifested in sharing the privations of so tedious a campaign has far surpassed my anticipations.

With the exception of the following named officers, absent with authority, all the officers of the regiment were present on all occasions detailed in this reports.*

During the present campaign the regiment has expended 46,500 rounds of ammunition in skirmishing with the enemy, and constructed 2,885 yards of breast-works.

The regiment has marched (including the distance from Pulaski, Tenn., Larkinsville, Tenn., [Ala.]),
