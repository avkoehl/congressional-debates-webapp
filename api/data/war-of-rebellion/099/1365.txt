GOLDSBOROUGH, March 10, 1865.

Lieutenant Colonel ARCHER ANDERSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

(Care General Johnston, Raleigh, N. C.)

Your instructions of yesterday have been obeyed about trains intended to be delayed for a short emergency. Superintendent of North Carolina Railroad was very much mistaken in his telegram reported by you. Last of Stewart's corps passed to Kinston this morning. Skirmishing there last night.

Assistant Adjutant-General.

GOLDSBOROUGH, March 10, 1865.

Lieutenant Colonel A. ANDERSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

(Care of General Johnston, Raleigh, N. C.)

Colonel Roy, assistant adjutant-general, telegraphed yesterday Sherman's advance very near Fayetteville. Scouts' reorts and citizens' seem to indicate Twenty-third Corps moved northward from Wilmington on Monday, destination either Kinston or Goldsborough, marching rapidly. If for Kinston, it probably reached there yesterday evening; if Goldsborough, it is near here. Wehther we are successful or not at Kinston, I suppose we soon move toward Fayetteville. I respectfully submit that all trains sent hence to Greensborough cannot return on close schedule time without accient or detention, under four days after the issue will probably be decided at Kinston. This suggestion made in General Bragg's absence and on account of the emergency.

JOHN B. SALE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
