Tvmch tins road was cjmmenced Aiguments, at
this time applicable, have, flora the altered condition
of the country, now lostthfii force In illustration
of this, lie would state that the report of the co n-
mittee of the Sena'e in 1805, recommending an ap-
propriation to form a communication between the
Ohio mei and the Atlantic States, concludes with
the fodovv mg argument
"Politicians have generally agreed that rivers
unite the interest and promote the Ir endship of those
w ho inhabit their banks, while mountains, on the
contrary, tend to the estrangement of those who are
sepai attd by then intervention In the present
cast, to make the crooked ways straight and the
lough ways smooth, will, in effect, remoie the in-
tervening mountains, and, by facilitating the inter-
course of our Western brethren with those on the
Atlantic, substantially unite them in interest, which
the committee believe to be the only effectual
cement of union applicable to the human lace "
S r, (said Mr G ) these objects have beenaccom-
pliMifl The crooked ways have been made
stia g^t, the rough ways smooth, the intervening
mountains have been scaled—not by this road only,
but oy numeious communications that owe their
ex istenee, not to Go\ ernmental patronage, but to m
divi lull eritei prise, to enterprise prompted bv en-
1 ghlened v evvs of oommeicial advantage, and the
stumg slimuhntaiismg from the hope of individual
wealth
Other argument, applicable m 1805, have now
1 st their foice Formidable tubes of ravages at
that time hung upon the skirts of our infant settle-
ments on the western side of the Alleghany moun-
tains, for whose defence it may have been proper
to form a communication by th s road with the At
lantic border How changed is the prospect1 The
magician has waived his wand, and the transitions
ha e been as rapid as the shifting scenes of a mov-
ing panorama' Those infant settlements have
sprung up into flourishing communities, the ex-
•ended foiest that then reposed in the deep so'itiulc
of primeval silence, is now a cultivated countiy,
v hose fields teem %vith fertility, whose towns and
v ihages and cities resound with the hum of busy
multitudes Over a country, it that time umrod
den, a\e by the foot of the untutored Indian or
solitary tripper, independent States now hold sway
over a population, numerous, mltlligf >it, patriotic,
brave, a population that, except on the cxtitme.
Irontiti, is so far from requinngdefenee fromothers,
we mustloo'c to with pride anil pleasure as being
not on!} ab'e but willing to afford effectual assis-
tance to their Atlantic biethrsn should they ever be
invaded by a foreign foe
The Cumberland road is completed continuously
•or some distance bejond the Ohio nvei, and Ins
been woiked upen in different places as far west
as Vandalia, in Illinois, within less than 100 mile*
of St Louis, and moie than 400 on the line of the
load beyond the Oh o uvei Mr C acknowledged
the foice of the aigument that might be used in
Javor of ap¡ ropiuiuous to connect the different
parts of tin road, and thus to lender what his
already been expended available But loik, sir,
sa d he, to the condit.cn oi the Treasury The re
pcrtmadi a few days since by the Committee of
Way and Mens shows tnat on the first of Janu-
ary list, i'lfie ti/BS less than file hvndred thousand
do'lais in the Tieasury of the United States appli-
cable to public expenditures In the same report
the estimated íesoimesof the present year, includ-
ing fe7,000,C 0 of Treasury notes, are placed at
5,31,000 000 Of which $,13,000,000 are es imated
Is the receipts from c istoins, and $3,000,000 from
public land--, bo h of which resources are admitted,
an the present condition of the country, to be un-
certain
Mr C had not, nor did he suppose that any gen-
tleman, e.'her m the House or out of it, possessel
the data that would enable him to form a satisfac-
tory opinion of the amount of duties that would
probably be p«id into the Treasury on the importa-
tion of foreign commodities, for the expei ence of
former yeais will afford no criterion by which to
iud"e of the present It must, however, be obvious
to all, that the lever of land speculation, which,
nder the influence of credits easily obtained, had
6Sfi stimulated almost to delirium, is rapidly sub-
siding, and that the purchases of the public land
willfoi the present year be limited almost evelu
sively to the demand for settlements This last
demand will be diminished at the public sales, fr< m
the strong and pernicious tendency of your pre-
emption laws to induce emigrants to seize upon tne
best pmttoni of the public domain not yet hi ought
into market He observed some of the íepresenta-
tives Aom the new States smile inciedulously at
this asseition But with the most respectful defe-
tence to those who advocated this system, he could
not but think that it held out an induce nent to ava-
rice that opeiated unfavorably upon the morals of
our pioneer population Mr C wished not to be
misunderstood, he made no cbaige against that
population, whose hardy entcrpnse had conquei d
the wilderness Among them you will not find the
íude unfeeling boot, that " against the houseles*
stranger shuts his dooi," but a population as much
distinguished by generous hospitality as by a love
of liberty and hardy enteiprise—i population
which, although peihaps destitute of some of those
minor advantages that a higher degree of improve-
mt nt will introduce, are cleai ins the way for towns
and villages md cultívale I fit Ids—a population
whose cneigies hive «-uimountcd difficulties and
dangers from which almost any otlurpeoph would
h-ivesluunk in despm, tint have conquered and
aie going on to conquer, that have laid and are now
laying the foundation for fntuie empires
Mi C would now íetuin to the subject fiom
which, he said, he had somewhat dipressed, and
admit tint the estimated receipts fiom the customs
and the public lands were not exaggerated, and
that the available moms of 1838 woul 1 amount to
§31,000 000 Deduct upwards of $16,000,000, not
di iwn from the Treasutv on the 1st of January, of
pievious appiopmtions, and upwards of $2,000,000
of appropnation-. under peimanent laws, and theie
lemams less linn <il 5,000,000 ipplicable to the an-
propri itions of the pieseiu yeai Deduct from this
amount upvv uds ot ^0 000 000 for Indi in his lh-
ties and upw aids of $000,000 lor the Canadian
fiontiei, and theic rem mis /<•« than •scvenmillions of
dolíais for the txpenditures of the Government, in-
cluding >he civil an I diplomatic list, the army,
navy, Jollifications, aimoues the survey of th"
coast andhubors, the ereclion of light-houses, and
ill «hci expenses It is true that the report of the
committee estimates that there will be $11,000,000
of unexpended appropriations on the 1st of January,
1839, but Mi C co tended that this did not
weaken the force of the argument, for appropri-
ations unexpended this year will remain as a tax
upon the next, and the $10,000,000 Treasury notes
that must be redeemed either towards the conclusion
of Ihe present, or early after the commencement of
the next yeai, is more than equal to any temporary
convenience that may be supposed to arise from
the estimated unexpended balance of appropriations
on the 1st of Tanuary, 1839
We are as careless, sir, as if we were sailing un-
der a cleai skv, with propitious breezes, over a
summei sra But do you see no speck on the po-
litical hon/on'i It is no longer a speck, a cloud
has anseii, whose d nk shadow is thrown upon the
prospect lefore us "Where js the faithful pilot'
Why does lir not vv arn us of tne breakers on v. hich,
with evciy sul spread out to the deceitful bie ze,
we are madly dnving' Where is the honorable
chanman of the Committee of Ways and Means,
[Mr Camerlm ng,] or the ehairman of the Com-
mittee of Claims, [Mr Whittusfy,] those faithful
guaidians of the public treasure? Why do they
not warn us of a national debt, as the inevitable
consequence of unnecessai y and extravagant ap-
propriations'
Mr C warned gentlemen of the consequence of
a national debt If we contract a national debt,
the " compiomise act of 1832," which brought
peace to a distracted country, w ill prove but a rope
of sand to an mocase of duties Yea more, the
veiy next revolution of the political wheel m?y
bring those into power, who will not h-sitate t)
direct the duties upon importations, constitution illy
mposed only as a means of raising revenue to
p?) th*5 leg ¡irrate expeadit ires of the Government,
to objects of protection
Scenes would then return, upon which he could
not look  back wtthotit feelings of unutterable dis-
gust     Piotection and anti protection would again
become   the  watchwords of parties   divided   by
geographical lines   Local prejudices and individu-
al avanre would again usurp m the halls of legis-
lation places that should be consecrated to patrio-
tism and vtitne    The clamorous importunities of
partial inteiests  would again intrude upon  our
tleliberations, and the Ametican Congress be again
conveikd into an arena for the most bitter contests.
If we would avoid this, we mus, if possible,
avoid contracting a national debt    A debt to some
extent, from the present prospects,cannot be avoid-
ed    But it is  our duty to refuse all appropria-
tions,  whethei constitutional or olherxvisc, that are
not abso'utely necessary to defray the expenses of
the Government No gentleman can doubtthatalarge
national debt will inevitably lead either to an increase
of the  tanfT, or to recalling the instalments from
the  States     To say nothing of the consequences
(of which we  have recently had bitter experience)
of .suddenly diveitmg, by an act of legislation, a
laige amount of money from the chañéis m which
it was employed, he doubted w hether there would
evet  be  found sufficient firmness in Congress to
adopt the latter alternative     Even if the instal-
ments should b" recalled from the States, he doubt-
ed wnether it would not prove to be calling "spirits
fiom the vasly deep "   You may, perhaps, recall
them,   "but will they come at  your bidding!"
Mr   C intended to make no insinuation against
the honor of the States, but, from the debates at
the extra session upon the proposition to withhold
the fouith instalment, he thought it probable that
many of the States looked upon the deposites that
have  been made with them as legitimate'y their
own property,  and, under this impression,  they
wi'l not willingly tax the industry of their citizens
to comply wuh what they may believe to be an ar-
biii ny and unauthorized demand
Within the las>t two hours we have passed a bill
cont lining appropmhons fi r an exploring expedi-
tion, for the employment of naturalists, geologists,
botanists, to examine the animals, soils, and plants
of distant lands, sUbje< ts with which tins Govern-
ment has as much to do as with the "vespertilio
homo," or man bat of the moon. In such appro-
pi íations do we give evidence of our sympathies for
the condition of our constituents, or afford a revela-
tion of the calamities that await them from our legisla-
tion'1 Do gentlemen not see that, by unnecessary
appropriations, they are sowing the seeds of bitter-
ness between the different sections of this Union'?
That they are digging a mine, which, when it is
filled, as it will be, with the elements of wrath, a
protective tariff, and fired by the collision of sepa-
rate interests, will produce an explosion that may
shake our political fabric? If public opinion does
not rise against unnecessary appropriations, and the
voice of economy be heard in this hall, he would
not say that the ruin ef the country, but he would
say that the oppression of the people, so far as an
increase of taxes is oppression, will be the inevita-
ble consequence
The present is an auspicious, time to commence
a reduction m that system of extravagant appro-
priations, which '■rrtainly received a great acces-
sion during trie time of a laige surplus revenue,
and theie is. no subject upon which we can with
more propriety commence than the Cumberland
read It it has long been a favorite object of Go-
vernment appropriations, and, if we recommit the
bill, with the instructions proposed, the people will
at once be convinced of our sincerity, and that they
must rely, at least while the Treasury is in an em-
barrassed condition, upon their own energies, with
the assistance of the States, to effect sack objects as
an enlightened view of their interests may induce
them to undeitake Individual and State enter-
p ise ?re, in leed, the on v legitimate, safe, and
economical agent? that can be employed in the con-
's rui ion oí internal improveme <^¡¡et immediately
connected with the foreign comriBftee or military
defence of the country.
He appealed particularly to the public spirit of
those gentlemen whose constituents were more im-
mediately interested in the passage of the bill under
consideration. No distinction, no honor arising
from place or power, can afford, to the jatnot tfte
