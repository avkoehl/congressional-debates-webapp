say that their purpose was to cross near. Florence in their transports, which would meet them there. Their pontoons have not yet arrived. I have sent a courier to Colonel Roddey, informing him of his movement. I think the two regiments of cavalry that have been ordered here can be supplied with oats and wheat for their animals in this valley for two weeks, when roasting-ears will be ripe, but it will be impossible for the men to subsist without the salt meat which I have asked for, and also some self.

I would suggest that as a means of transporting prisoners who may be captured below, and also of transporting supplies, that the boats running between Rome and Gadsden be ordered to make two or three trips, a week, instead of one, as now. This will be the most expeditions route of communicating with me in the future, and I request that the general will so order it. I recomb the present line of couriers in the most expeditious mode of transmitting dispatch, I am satisfied the enemy intend crossing the river if he can possibly do so. His attempting to cross near Florence indicates his intention to attack General Johnston's rear, and I therefore renew the application that the General Johnston's brigade be sent here. This is the best point for protecting his and your own rear.

Respectfully,

GID. J. PILLOW,

Brigadier-General, C. S. Army.
