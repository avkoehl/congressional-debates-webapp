can spare in the direction of Clinton. See to it that this command moves promptly on the 1st of March, properly equipped and not burdened with any baggage. The officer in charge must act according to circumstances. The object is to draw the enemy's attention and cause his force to be gathered to meet this movement. Report what force is ordered to go, and also as soon as they have actually started.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Chief of Staff, Washington, D. C.:

Your telegram of 15th received. Fort Smith was not entirely evacuated. The commanding officer and most of the troops have been changed. We now have supplies therefor at least six months, and the Arkansas River is navigable. Gaines' Landing will be occupied as soon as practicable.

Major General N. J. T. DANA,

Commanding, &amp;c., Memphis, Tenn.:

A cavalry expedition will move from Vicksburg on the 5th proximo for the purpose of cutting the railroad and telegraph lines below Jackson, and striking the Mobile and Ohio Railroad at or near Winchester and destroying as much of it as possible between that place and Mobile. A detachment of the same force will destroy the communication between Jackson and Meridian. Co-operative movements will be made from Baton Rouge on the 1st and from Memphis on the 3rd, and I desire that as large a demonstration as possible be made from the latter place in the direction of Grenada, to distract the attention of the enemy from the main expedition and for the purpose of cutting the railroad and telegraph lines as far as they can go, and of otherwise inflicting as much damage on the rebels as possible. Be pleased to take the necessary measures at once to have the movement made promptly and effectually.
