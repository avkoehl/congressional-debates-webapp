HARPER'S FERRY, September 26, 1862.

General MARCY,

Chief of Staff:

Just received the following:

I arrived at this point on the Charlestown road. Two miles from Charlestown I find the enemy's pickets scattered through the country. I have driven them before me thus far. My advance guard report artillery in front of Charlestown, and the scout I sent out on my right from this point reports a large body of the enemy-infantry, cavalry, and artillery-about 1 mile. I don't deem it prudent to advance farther with my command, and shall fall back to within about 1 1/2 miles of your camp. Please sent this on to General Pleasonton.
