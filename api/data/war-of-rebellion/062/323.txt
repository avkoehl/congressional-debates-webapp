Lieutenant Colonel BRUTSCHE, Commanding, Lebanon, Mo.:

COLONEL: The passengers arriving in the stage this morning inform me that the stage was robbed yesterday near Waynesville. I desire you to sent at least 60 men of your command east of the Gasconade and scout the country thoroughly on all sides of the stage road, moving into the region where the enemy are., I think that they would accomplish more by moving at least a portion of them on foot. Have them go prepared for a forty days' scout; let them draw their rations at the Gasconade. For the purpose of field operations, Captain Wilson will report to and receive orders from you. The section of country between the Gasconade and Waynesville must be cleaned out. Do it if you have to put a man under every bush.
