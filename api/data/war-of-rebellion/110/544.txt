EXECUTIVE OFFICE,

Macon, Miss., October 15, 1863.

General JOSEPH E. JOHNSTON,

Commanding Department:

GENERAL: The bearer, Colonel Jones S. Hamilton, adjutant-general of the State of Mississippi, desires to raise a command for the obstruction of the navigation of the Mississippi River, and his proposition has been approved by the President. This service, if efficiently performed, would be most valuable to the Government. To facilitate the organization of the command I have authorized him and Colonel Rives to take such unattached State trooops as are now mounted as or willing to accept the serfice and bemustered into Confederate service for the war. These gentlemen have been in the Confederate and State service since the commencement of the war, and thei success will be gratifying to me. Any assistance you may be able to give them will place me under renewed obligations.

Very respectfully,

JOHN J. PETTUS.

EXECUTIVE OFFICE,

Macon, Miss., October 15, 1863.

General J. E. JOHNSTON,

Commanding Department:

GENERAL: His Excellency the Governor directs me to say to you that he has no objections whatever to turning over to you all the State troops, except about 1,000 men under the immediate command of Major-General Gholson, which he desires to retain in the northeastern portion of the State during the session of the Legislature, which convenes on the first Monday in November, for its protection from raids, &amp;c. All other State troops will be turned over to your command. The Governor desires me to say, in addition to the above, that he has been informed by Major-General Gholson that Captain Wallis' company, Second Regiment Mississippi State Cavalry, Lieutenant Colonel W. L. Lowry commanding, mutinied and deserted their regiment, reported to General Ferguson, and were mustered into the Confedeerate service; and that upon demand General Ferguson refused to give them up to Colonel Lowry. His Excellency desires that you will order this company to be returned to its original status. sIn turnign over the State troops it will be necssary that some satisfactory arrangement shoujld be made in relation to State property in their possession--horses, wagons, &c. The only reason for retaining General Gholson's immediate comamdn is that the Executive may have esome troops at his disposal during the session of the Legislature. If this command were turned over now the State would not have one bayonet with which to protect its own Legislature.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAMES H. RIVES,

Colonel and Aide-de-Camp.
