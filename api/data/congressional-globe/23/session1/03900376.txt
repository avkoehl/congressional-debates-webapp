manner in the present case He hoped the affairs
of the Navy would be taken into the serious con-
sideration of the House, and unless we suspend
our action on this subject till the next session,
there would be no use in printing the extra copies
Mr REED said, many of the officers had wiit-
ten to membeis of the House for copies of the
proposed regulations, and he thought they ought
to have them The object was important and the
expense small
Mi WILLIAMS was as anxious, he said, as
his colleague could be, to pieient unnecessary ex-
pense, and would concur with him in opposing the
exercise of legislative authority by the Executive,
but this was not now the question It was neces-
sary that eveiy officer should have a copy of these
rules, and it was improper to put them at the
expense of printing them for themselves " They
weie not yet adopted, but it was piobable that
they would be, without much further alteration
He felt that he could discharge his duty better on
the subject, efter learning the opinions of the offi-
cers of the Navy.
Mr WHITE read the act under which the rules
and legulatiore had been proposed
Aftei which, the íesolution was agreed to, with-
out a division

l ng the Military Academy, for consideration, when

tleman fiom Kentucky, [Mi   Johnson ]

which had not been acted upon

« toms, two thousand dollars per annum"—
The yeas and nays were oidered
The question being taken, it was determined in
the affirmative   Yeas 85, nays 79.
So tin  clause was adopted
Mr VANCE then withdiew the remaindei of

Mi WHITE, if Florida, moved to amend the

sation of «hejudgesof Florida Territory, for special

the act of May, 1828, for the years 1833 and 1834,

Ayes 84, noes 48.

adding an item appropriating $1,000 to defray the
costs of certain suits against the United States
After some explanation between Messrs Mc-
KAY and WHITE, the amendment was adopted
without a division
Mr SUTHERLAND moved that the following
section be added to the bill
" ilnd be it further enacted, That the Secretary
' of the Tieasuiy be, and he is hereby, authorized
1 to pay to the collectors, naval officers, surveyors,
' cleiks, gaugers, weighers, provers,maikers, and
' measurers, of the several ports of the United
' States, out of any money in the Treasury not
' otherwise appropnated, such sums as will give
' to the said officers, respectively, the same com
' pensation in the year one thousand eight hundred
'and thirty-four,according to the importations of
1 that yeai, as they would have been entitled to
' receive, if the act of the fourteenth July, eigh-
' teen hundred and thirty-two had not gone into
'effect "
Mr S felt that a few remarks by way of ex-
planation were necessary, after the vote which
had been given this morning He was able to
satisfy any gentleman that, unless this provision
was made, the collectorof Philadelphia, instead of
receiving $3,000 per annum, to which he was re-
stricted by the amendment which had been adoptsd,
would, in fact, be more than $3,000out of pocket.
That collector was allowed by law a commission
on the duties of three-eighths of one per cent.,
which amounted the past year to $6,300 The
official fees amounted to $2,900. These together
amount to $9,200 Now, the collector is obliged
to pay m clerk hire $12,200, and $700 for station-
ery Unless, theiefore, this provision be adopted,
the collectoi of Philadelphia would not get any
compensation whatevei He mentioned this as an
illustration of the necessity for the amendment
It has been the desire, for some time past, of the
Committee on Commerce, to arrange a general
system of regulation on this subject. A mass of
materials had been collected for this purpose, which
had been unfortunately burnt Papers weie now
in the progiess of being obtained, which would
shed the necessary light on this important branch
of our íevenue system, to enable a proper law to
be fiamed
Mr CLAYTON said, it was well known that
the House had raised a committee m consequence
of a resolution introduced by himself.for the pur-
pose of inquning into the piopnety of reducing
salaues and abolishing offices During a recent
visit to New Yoik, he was infoimed of certain
facts relative to the collection of the customs
theie, which induced him to warn the House not
to giope m the dark There had been a great
met ease of officers there since 1828 Mr C gave
way to
Mr SUTHERLAND, who said that more care,
vig'lance, and circumspection, was necessary to
be exercised, when part of a cargo consisted of
goods fiee of duty The officers of customs, in
this county, were men of high character and
respectability He hoped no measures would be
taken, which might, by any possibility, tend to
lower this standaid, and place them on a footing
of those in Earope Unless a fair compensation is
given them, they cannot dischaige their duties. If
the revenue is not collected, there will be no occa-
sion for inquiring where the Treasury is Mr S.
went into a detailed statement showing the pro
pnety of the amendment
Mi POLK requested that a letter from the Sec-
retary of the Treasury, dated 30 h Apnl last, on
the subject of the compensation of custom-house
offcers, might be lead, which having been done
Mr. P   said, a provision or this subject would
have been introduced into the bill, had this letter
been received in sufficient season.
Mr CLAYTON said it was impossible to fore-
see the consequences of adopting this amendmen t.
There had been a great increase of custom house
officers in New York since 1828, which he enu-
merated The annual expense had increased from
$150,000 to $300,000. Before any such measure
as tins 13 adopted, there should be a full investiga-
tion on the subject.
The additional section proposed by Mr Suth-
erland was so modified as to apply only to col-
lectors, naval officeis, and surveyors
Mr. S said he would vote for the amendment in
its altered state, though it was not in the shape he
desired It was, nevertheless, better than no pro-
vision on the subject
After some remarks from Mr. J. W HUNT-
INGTON in opposition to the amendment as
modified—
Mr GORHAM said he was opposed to the
amendment as it originally stood, extending, as it
did, to the officers appointed by the collector, as
well as to those appointed by the President and
Senate But,as modified, he saw no objection to
its adoption Unless something of this kind was
done, it was unceitam whether the three officers
now included in the amendment would receive any
compensation whatever The amounts had all
been limited by the vote upon the amendment by
the gentleman from Ohio At the principal ports
he was m favor of compensating them up to the
amount of the limitation, indeed, going beyond it,
for the limitation adopted this morning had not
received his vote
Mi. HARPER, of Pennsylvania, went into a
statement of the compensation of certain subordi-
nate officers of the customs under the amendment
as it omginally stood
The CHAIR apprized him of the modification.
Mi H intimated that he had no objection to
the amendment as it now stood
After some remarks from Messrs SELDEN
and JARVIS relative to the emoluments of officers
of the customs—
Mr VANCE moved ah amendment to the
amendment, directing a certain proportion of the
officeis of the customs of New York to be dis-
missed                                                    
Mr V. said, after these officers had been dis-
missed there will have been an increase since 1828.
The gentleman from New Jersey [Mr. Parker]
had stated a few days since that the tariff of 1828
had given rise to so much smuggling as to render
an mciease of custom-house officers necessary.
If the high duties were a sufficient reason for
increasing the officers, the reduction of duties
should be a sufficient reason for cutting down their
number.
Mr. CAMBRELENG said he must be permit-
ted to say this was an extraordinary mode of pro-
ceeding upon a subject which requ red so careful
an examination of facts The gentleman from
Georgia [Mr Claytov] had íeferred to the in-
crease of officers at New York He hoped that
gentleman would do the collector the justice to
ascertain the number of vessels which entered and
cleared at that port, examine into the amount of
the revenue collected, and satisfy himself whether
it was collected so economically at any other port
of the United States He was entirely willing to
support any well digested and practicable arrange-
ment of these offices. The amendment, as it had
been originally moved, was the same as was pro-
posed at the last session by the then chairman of
the Committee of Ways aid Mean*—a gentleman
who resided in the city of New York, and who
had also drawn the report in favor of the United
States Bank
Mr PARKER said the amendment to the
amendment did not go far enough It only pro-
posed to dismiss a part of the custom house offi-
cers It should have gone to dismiss the whole
He had frequently had occasion to go to the cus-
tom-house n New York He was entirely con-
vinced that the officers there employed could not
be dispensed with He had never seen in his life
individuals more busily employed. Gentlemen
appeared to suppose that because the rate of duties
had been lessened, there was less employment for
customhouse officers He would infoim those
gentlemen that everything required before to be
