APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

41st Cong....2d Sess.
Reduction of the Army—Mr. Logan.
Ho. of Reps.
unless he has been a paymaster in the Army, or
a paymaster's clerk, or drawn pay as an officer
himself. I venture that assertion because of
the general want of knowledge on the subject
of the amount paid to Army officers. The mili-
tary laws of the-United States have been com-
piled by one of the clerks of the Senate Mili-
tary Committee. He gives all the laws which
have been passed by Congress in reference to
our military establishment. You will find in
that book on military laws, page 90, that on
the 3d of March, 1701, the present arrangement
for pay commenced, the only difference being
as to the amounts allowed officers. The amount
of pay has been changed and increased many
times since then. Jt was changed March 5,
1702, and changed again March o, 1705, and
there was still another change made March 1G,
1802. Congress after Congress lias changed the
pay of the Army, now increasing at one end
and then at the other. Atone session we have
a resolution or bill increasing the pay proper,
what is called the monthly pay, and in another
Congress wc have a resolution or bill adding
to the number of rations. The pay has increased
to such an extent that it. is now most extrava-
gant. In other words, sir, wo to-day pay onr
officers of the Army more than any other Gov-
ernment in the world.
Now, sir, I ask why do we spend $37,000,000
on thirty-seven regiments? I will explain
how some of the great expense arises. The
Army has a great staff, for which they have but
little use. All these staff officers require to
have houses, forage, commutation of rations—
everything of that kind. For instance, you
have a quartermaster's establishment in New
York. There are not there five hundred troops
to-day in the department, and yet they have
allowed for rent of buildings for headquarters
and other offices an amount reaching over
thirty thousand dollars a year. I speak merely
of office rent. Why it is I do not know, but
that is the fact. In some military departments
the rent of headquarters alone is $15,000. I
believe it costs a great deal more than that in
San Francisco. That is the way in which the pub-
lic money is spent for rental of offices, and for
quarters at extravagant prices for a gentleman
who is perhaps a lieutenant colonel or colonel.
Then I want to call the attention of the House
particularly to the law as it now stands on the
subject of pay. I will show the House what
the pay of each general is. The pay of the
General of the Army, pay proper, is $4,800;
and what is the pay which ho actually draws
from the paymaster? I have it certified by
the paymaster that what the General of the
Army is paid amounts to $10,278. Now, how
does that come about ? The excess over the
pay proper is on account of rations, forage,
commutation of quarters, and everything else
a man can imagine, summed up together in
such a way that neither you nor I could sit
down and figure it out satisfactorily.
Then, sir, what is the pay of the Lieutenant
General of the Army ? The pay proper of the
Lieutenant General of the Army is $3,210 a
year; but he actually draws $14,803 97, the
excess being for commutation of quarters, for-
age, and other things that no one out of the
Army knows anything about.
We comenextlothemajorgenerals. Major
General TT. W. Halleck receives as his pay
proper $2,640, but be actually draws from the
Government$9,8G2 98. Major General George
G. Meade has as his pay proper $2,640, but he
draws from the Government $9,342 05. I do
not know why there is this difference ; why it
is that they do not draw exactly the same
amount. Major General George H. Thomas
has as his pay proper $2,640, but he draws
from the Government $9,524 19. Major Gen-
eral W. S. Hancock has as his pay proper $2,640,
but he draws $0,735 60. Major General J.
M. Schofiekl has as his pay proper $2,049,
but draws $7,432 92—some $2,000 less than
the others. There is a memorandum here that
the reason of that is that he is not reported as
drawing any commutation ; it is not said com-
mutation of what. Without commutation his
pay is $7,432 92. If he had been paid com-
mutation he would no doubt have drawn as
much as the others.
The same sort of thing is found all the vvaj'
down. A brigadier general's pay per annum
is $1,493 ; but Brigadier General McDowell
draws $7,428 74; Brigadier General Cooke
draws $7,662 55; Brigadier General O. O.
Howard draws $5,055 61 ; Brigadier General
Augur draws $5,959 40.
Some of them draw over seven thousand
dollars, some of them over six thousand dol-
lars, and some of them over five thousand
dollars. Why is it that there is such a differ-
once? The reason of the difference is this;
at some places the quartermasters allow the
generals larger prices for forage and commu-
tation of quarters than at others. It depends
upon the quartermaster what price is_set upon
fuel and forage; and as the amount is increased
the general's pay isincreased. If the quarter-
master says that your fuel shall bo commuted
at so much per cord, you will get so much; but
if another quartermaster agrees to commute at
twice as much, you got twice as much. That
is the reason of the differences of pay among
the officers of the Army.
We propose to reduce all this to a system ;
wo propose to give each officer of the Arm;.,
such pay as he is entitled to ; we propose to
give it by the year, a regular fixed salary. 1
have hero tabular statements as to the pay
and allowances of officers, which 1 will pub-
lish in my remarks. And I wish to call at-
tention to the fact that these pay-rolls are
certified to by the Paymaster General of
the Army, and may be relied upon as cor-
rect. :
