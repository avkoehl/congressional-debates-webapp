HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE OHIO,Strawberry Plains, March 21, 1864.

Brigadier-General WOOD,

Commanding Third Division, Fourth Army Corps:

SIR: Your dispatch of this day is received and forwarded by telegraph to General Schofield at Knoxville. General Stoneman has been directed to have the cavalry report to you at once. The delay is as yet unexplained. Everything is reported quiet in front of Mossy Creek.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. D. COX,

Brigadier-General, Acting Chief of Staff.

ATHENS, ALA., March 21, 1864.

Major R. M. SAWYER,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Nashville:

It is reported from pretty reliable sources, but from citizens, that Forrest was at Corinth Wednesday night: that he was to cross the river some point south of Hamburg. I have sent a mounted force toward Florence.

Cypert has a regiment of loyal Tennesseans at Clifton. My mounted force, you know, is small. What I have is now feeling toward Gadsden, crossed the mountains yesterday, and passed through Somerville; as yet met no force of consequence. The gunboats on Tennessee River should notify us of any movement.

It is very probable they are going where Hurlbut suggests.

G. M. DODGE,

Brigadier-General.

ATHENS, ALA., March 21, 1864.

General SWEENY, Pulaski:

Reports are current here that General Forrest, with a large force, is crossing the river at or near Eastport. You will send the Seventh Illinois in that direction to ascertain and report the facts. Have them start to-night and report all the news to the nearest point on the railroad, to be telegraphed to headquarters.

One battalion of the Ninth Ohio Cavalry is now in the vicinity of Florence.

By order of General Dodge:

GEO. E. SPENCER,

Colonel and Chief of Staff.

ATHENS, ALA., March 21, 1864.

Major R. M. SAWYER,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Nashville:

A telegraph operator from rebel lines has come into Decatur and reports that Forrest moved from Columbus, Miss., with a pontoon bridge, and that he is crossing at or near Eastport. I have sent mounted force in that direction. The gun-boats should move up the river and watch it closely. This may be a lie to deceive us.

G. M. DODGE,

Brigadier-General.
