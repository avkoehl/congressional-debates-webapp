is moving with his command on General Grant's communications between Young's Point and New Carthage. General [J. G.] Walker's DIVISION was ordered on the 14th of April from the Arkansas River to Northern Louisiana. Owing to the distance on the difficulties encountered, they only arrived on Red River the 24th instant. General Taylor, with a force of less than 3,000 infantry, has been opposed to Banks' corps, nearly 30,000 strong. The withdrawal of Banks has made Taylor's command disposable, and, with Walker's DIVISION, he is ordered to operate on the Mississippi River opposite Vicksburg. A brigade of General Price's DIVISION at Little Rock has been ordered to Monroe, La., to co-operate in this movement.

General Taylor will keep you informed of his movements whenever practicable, and he is instructed to spare no exertions in his efforts to throw supplies into Vicksburg from the WEST bank of the river. Had there been any disposable forces, it would have been impossible to have used them between bayou Macon and the Mississippi River, as that country has been overflowed until within the last ten days.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. KIRBY SMITH.
