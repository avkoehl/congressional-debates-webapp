HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,June 29, 1863-11.45 p. m.

Major-General THOMAS:

SIR: The general commanding directs you to make a prudent and sharp reconnaissance, driving those regiments of the enemy which General Brannan reports in his front, and find out what they are about; also report your direction and position with reference to some point we know-say, Bobo's; also the character of the ground for moving troops.

J. A. GARFIELD,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS FOURTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Crumpton's Creek, June 29, 1863-4.30 p. m.

Brigadier-General GARFIELD,

Chief of Staff:

Second dispatch received. First dispatch answered, except as to character of ground for moving troops. From what I can learn, the country is not very accessible; chiefly timbered, with here and there an opening. As you near Tullahoma it becomes more open. The roads are exceedingly bad.

Very respectfully,

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS FOURTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Crumpton's Creek, June 29, 1863.

Brigadier-General BRANNAN,

Commanding Third Division:

The general commanding desires you to press the enemy as much as you can with safety. It is strongly suspected they are evacuating Tullahoma, if not already gone. The commissary train will not leave this place until to-morrow morning. It is very desirable to send some of your train back, if possible.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

[GEO. E. FLYNT,]

Assistant Adjutant-General and Chief of Staff.

By command of Major-General Thomas:

[GEO. E. FLYNT,]

Assistant Adjutant-General and Chief of Staff.
