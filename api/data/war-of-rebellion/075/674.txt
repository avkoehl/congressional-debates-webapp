HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF TENNESSEE,Dalton, May 7, 1864.

Major-General MARTIN,

Rome, Ga.:

GENERAL: The enemy are reported as having a division to-day at La Fayette, and a larger force prepared to join it and march by our left upon Rome or the railroad in our rear. Under this state of affairs, General Johnston directs me to say that the duty devolves upon to guard the road and the line from Rome to Calhoun, and, as Calhoun can be much sooner reached by an enemy from La Fayette than Rome can, he wishes you to move up the river and take position in the vicinity of Calhoun. A division of the enemy are reported to have been within eight miles of La Fayette last evening, and expected to be joined by a still larger infantry and a large cavalry force to-day. It will be necessary to keep this force under your close observation, and to keep strict watch on the fords between you and Rome. Leave at Rome the men of your command who are not effective as cavalry, with a few mounted men to observe in front and to give notice to the brigades of Loring, now marching upon Rome, of any approach of the enemy to Rome.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. W. MACKALL,

Chief of Staff.

DALTON, May 7, 1864.

General MARTIN,

Rome, Ga.:

Keep some couriers on the road from Rome to northern terminus of the Selma railroad to Rome, and report here promptly the progress of any troops coming toward Rome.

W. W. MACKALL,

Chief of Staff.

Commanding, Rome:

Send a messenger to meat General Loring's brigades coming to Rome from Blue Mountain, and give them General Johnston's orders to move on to Rome with all possible dispatch. Let your messenger continue on from brigade to brigade until he reaches Blue Mountain or meets General Loring.

Chief of Staff.

DALTON, May 7, 1864.

General CANTEY,

So soon as the remainder of the Arkansas brigade reaches Resaca from Mobile stop it at Resaca, and bring your own brigade by the cars to this place, says General Johnston.

W. W. MACKALL,

Chief of Staff.
