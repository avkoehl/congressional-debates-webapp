Mr. SCOTT. To see whether we can agree,
I will move to insert, " and to the Register of
the Treasury for signing bonds."
Mr. EDMUNDS. That I cannot agree to,
because I do not think we ought to introduce
into the statute a provision for paying a per-
son specifically for doing part of his own duties.
That is my objection. I am entirely willing
to leave it to the Secretary of the Treasury to
say whether this sum of $22,500 shall be
apportioned partly to the Register of the
Treasury as well as to other persons employed
in his office. Therefore I move, if it is now
in order, to insert in line three hundred and
ninety-six, on page 17, after the word "to,"
the words "officers and," and also to strike
out the word "office," in the same line, and
insert" department," because his "office," in
a technical sense, would not include the
Register of the Treasury; so that the clause
will read :
And for additional clerks and additional compen-
sation to officers and clerks in his Department,
#22,500.
The VICE PRESIDENT. Is there objec-
tion to this proposition? The Chair under-
stands there is no objection. The proviso on
the top of the twenty-second page is stricken
out, and the clause on the seventeenth page
of the bill, line three hundred and ninety-
six, is amended by the insertion of the words
proposed by the Senator from Vermont, the
amount of the appropriation remaining un-
The Secretary will now resume the reading
of the bill on page 22, the Senate first acting
on the amendments of the Committee on
Appropriations as they are reached in the
reading of the bill.
The reading of the bill was continued.
The next amendment of the Committee on
Appropriations was oil page 23, after line five
hundred and fifty-five, to add to the clause
making an appropriation for detecting and
bringing to punishment persons guilty of vio-
latingthe internal revenue laws the following:
And from and after tho passage of this act the
Secretary of the Treasury shall have power to em-
ploy not more than three persons to assist the proper
officers of the Government in discovering and col-
lecting any money belonging to the United States
whenever the same shall be withheld by any person
or corporation, upon such terms and conditions as
he shall deem best for the interests of the United
States; but no compensation shall be paid to such
persons except out ot the money and property so
secured.
Mr. SCOTT. I should like to have an ex-
planation of that amendment from the chair-
man of the committee.
Mr. COLE. It is understood, or was so
stated, that there were large sums of money
due the Government, from individuals and cor-
porations throughout the country who are at-
tempting to defy the law, and perhaps success-
fully doing so, so far as it relates to their duty
to pay taxes. This proviso does not make any
appropriation for the payment of services in
assisting the collection of such dues to the
Government, but only authorizes the Secre-
tary of the Treasury, if he shall see fit, to em-
ploy some additional aid to enforce the laws.
Mr. SCO IT. I notice it applies to not only
"discovering" but "collecting."
Mr. COLE. To assist the regular officers.
The amendment was agreed to.
The next, amendment was on page 25, line
five hundred and eighty-five, to reduce the
appropriation for stationery for the Treas-
ury Department and its several bureaus from
850.000 to $45,000.
The amendment was agreed to.
The next amendment was on page 25, line
five hundred and ninety-nine, to reduce the
appropriation for furniture for the Treasury
Department from $50,000 to $25,000.
The amendment was agreed to.
The next amendment was on page 25, line
sis hundred and five, to reduce the appro-
priation for coal, wood, lighting the Treasury
building, baskets, books, &c., from $50,000 to
$40,000.
Tho amendment wa3 agreed to.
The next amendment was on page 2G, line
six hundred and nine, in the clause making
appropriations for the office of the Assistant
Treasurer at New York, to strike out the words
"chiefs of division, tellers, registers, clerks,
book-keepers, messengers, keeper of building,
watchmen, engineer, detectives, and porter,
$137,942," and in lieu thereof to insert the
following:
Cashier and chief clerk, $4,200; chief of coin divis-
ion, $4,000; chief of general pay division, $3,000;
assistant chief of general pay division, $2,200; chief

four book-keepers, at $1,800 each, $7,200; five clerks,
at $1,800 each, $9,000; three clerks, at *1,750 each,
$5,250; four clerks, at 51,700 each, $6,800; one clerk,
$1,600; foar clerks, at si,500 each, £6,000; six clerks,
at $1,400 each, $8,400 ; three clerks, at $1,300 eaoh,
$3,900; one clerk, $1,200; one clerk, $1,000; two mes-
sengers, at $1,300 each, $2,600; six messengers, at 84
per day each, $7,512; onemessengcr, $St)0; one keeper
of building, $1,800; one engineer, $1,000; one porter,
$900; six watchmen, at $2 per day each, $1,380; one
watchman, $600; chief detective, $1,800; assistant
detectivo, $1,400.
Mr. EDMUNDS. I think it ought to be
stated before this amendment is adopted that
this is not increasing salaries or making new
offices. It is only segregating and separating
the total appropriation which stands in the
ITouse bill, so as to fix the name of each office
and the salary attached to it; that is all.
Mr. COLE. As it was last year?
Mr. EDMUNDS. Yes, sir.
The amendment was agreed to.
The next amendment was on page 28, line
six hundred and sixty one, in the clause
making appropriations for the office of the
Assistant Treasurer at Boston, to strike out
the words "for clerks and messengers, $23,000;
for three watchmen, $2,160;" and to insert
in lieu thereof the following :
]?or paying teller, $2,500; one interest clerk, #2,500;
receiving teller, $1,800; one clerk, $1,800; onebook-
keeper, $1,700; two clerks, atC'l.oOO each, $3,000; two
clerks,.at $1,400 cach, $2,800: two clerks, at SI,200
each, $2,400; one clerk, $1,108; two clerks, at SI,000
each, $2,000; one clerk, $800; two watchmen, at $850
cach, $1,700; one messenger and watchman, $1,060.
Mr. THURMAN. As this amendment is
one of a class, there being a number of the
same kind proposed, I should like to make
an inquiry of the chairman of the committee.
In the bill as it came from the House the ap-
propriation was, " for clerks and messengers,
$23,000; for three watchmen, $2,160." The
salaries of the clerks or the number of clerks
was not specified in the bill. The amendment,
proposes in effect to fix the number of clerks
and to fix the salary of each clerk, if I under-
stand it aright.
Mr. COLE. Yes, sir.
Mr. THURMAN. I think that as a general
rule is a very great improvement on the prac-
tice of appropriating in a lump. I have ob-
jected atformer sessions to the mode of appro-
priating in a lump, as we did at one time, I
remember, on a naval appropriation bill, ap-
propriate about three fourths or four fifths of
the whole appropriation for the Navy Depart-
ment in one lump, without anything to desig-
nate how much was to go to one purpose, and
how much was to go to another purpose—a
very bad practice, in my judgment. I think,
therefore, the Committee on Appropriations
have done extremely well in specifying the
objccts of the appropriation and the amount to
bo appropriated.
The question I wish to submit to the chair-
man is whether, putting it in this form and
without anything else, this result may not
happen: that if not so much clerical help is
needed, yet there will be ihe pay for it. As
the bill came from the House the collector
would employ so much and no more than was
absolutely necessary—although I dare say he
would employ up to the full amount of the
appropriation, for that is the custom of such
people, whether they need the help or not—
yet he could employ as much as was neces-
sary, and no more, and some of the appropri-
ation might be saved; but in the form in which
the committee have put it, it is questionable
whether he must not employ all this labor So
that all the salary will be paid. I mention this
because this is one of a class of amendments
made by the committee in the general intent
and purpose of which I very heartily concur,
and think the committee deserve well for hav-
ing been so specific.
Mr. COLE. This is an attempt to carry out
a policy which was partially inaugurated last
year in ihe appropriation bills, and which we
wish to have permanently established, if pos-
sible, by appropriating to the several officers
employed the specific salaries they will be
entitled to under the law. But I will state, in
reply to the last suggestion of the Senator from
Ohio, that there is no more obligation on tho
part of the head of the office to employ more
clerks than are really necessary under this
form than there would be if the appropria-
tion were made in a lump.
Mr. THURMAN. If that is the understand-
ing, that no obligation rests Oil the collector
to employ all the clerks who are named here,
but only to employ as many as he needs, then
certainly I have no objection, and no sugges-
tion to make, except to repeat that I think the
committee have done extremely well in report-
ing the bill in this form.
Mr. EDMUNDS. That is all there is to it.
We do not require him to employ any at all
unless they are necessary, but the evil we wish
to obviate is, first, the sweeping appropriation
of money, about which both of us agree ; and
secondly, the abuse (and I do not know but
we ought to have an investigation about it,
for I have heard of one instance) that subor-
dinate officers are tempted to commit where
there is a gross appropriation, of paying high
salaries to some of their friends and low sal-
aries to other people ; in other words, grind-
ing the face of the poor in order to pay a fat
salary to some favored person. Of course,
that is an abuse which ought not to be toler-
ated. A' sweeping gross appropriation is a
standing temptation to do that thing, to make
unjust and unfair discriminations among em-
ployes. The object of this amendment, is to
eliminate that evil, and to fix the compensa-
tion of every person who may be employed,
not to oblige them to employ anybody.
The amendment was agreed to.
The next amendment was on page 29, in the
clause making appropriations for the office of
Assistant Treasurer at Philadelphia, to strike
out, the words "for clerks, messengers, and
watchmen, $34,823," and in lieu thereof to
insert, the following :
For cashier and chief clerk, $2,700; chief book-
keeper, $2.500; chief interest clerk, $1,900; assistant
book-keeper, $1,800; coin teller, $1,700; registered
intere&tclerk, $1,700; assistant coupon clerk, $1,600;
fractional currency clerk, $1,600; assistant regis-
tered loan clerk, $1,500; assistant registered loan
clerk, $1,400; assistant coin teller, $1,400; assistant
fractional currency clerk, $1,400; receiving teller,
$1,300; assistant receiving teller, $1,200; superin-
tendent of building, $1,100; seven temale counters,
at $S0o each, $0,300; lour watchmen, at $930 cach,
$3,720.
Mr. THURMAN. I should like to make
one inquiry of the chairman for my own satis-
faction. I understand that the appropriations
for the mint at San Francisco are $20,GOO;
and for the Mint >it Philadelphia $36,323, or
$16,000 more. It is very true the Mint at
Philadelphia is called the parent Mint, I be-
lieve, and the other a branch mint usually;
hut is there really any necessity for this ex-
pense in Philadelphia beyond the expense^at
San Francisco, when the business at S:m
Francisco is fifty times what it is in Philadel-
phia?
