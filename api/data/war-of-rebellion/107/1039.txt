HEADQUARTERS,Charleston, May 12, 1863.

Colonel R. B. HAYES,

Commanding Brigade Opposite Charleston:

Your note is just received and all is right. There is, of course, great commotion in town. All will think it horrible, but they have been playing the game of teachery and must take the result. I have ordered 100 men to be brought over as a firing party. Hope the rebels will not come in, but it they do Charleston must be deployed. I have been reading the treacherus correspondence of the people here for the last thee months, and I think that our wives and children deserve as much consideration as those of Charleston.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

E. P. SCAMMON,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

CHARLESTON, May 12, 1863.

Colonel HAYES:

I have alredy given you the 'scare." Think there is truth in it. Will probably by over before morning. Meantime, I direct you to have guns in readiness to fire on Charleston. If rebels come in here Charleston shall be destroyed, for it is the work of disloyal citizens.

E. P. SCAMMON,

Brigadier-General.

SIR: I am directed by General Scammon to have all in readiness for an attack. I do not think it necessary to awaken the men at present, but you will see that sentinels are on the alert, and such preparations are made as will enable you to have your men ready for an attack on the shortest notice. Captain Simmonds and Lieutenant Austin, in case of alarm, will put their guns in position to bear on Charleston.

Respectfully,
