care of the people, and m recusing a i embarrass-
ing, entangling, and dangerous alliances with cor-
porations of any description, it was but obevmg
the great law of self pieservation Buf enough,
I can not any longer waste words on such o tac-
tions I intend no disrespect to those who have
urged them , jet these, and argument  like hese,
are mainly relied on to countervail the many and
formidable objections, drawn from the highest con-
siderations that can influence the action of Go-
vernments or individuals, none of which have
been refitted and many not even denied
The Stnator from Massachusetts (Mr Webster)
urged an argument ot a veiy different character,
but which, in my opinion, he cntiteiy failed to
establish He asserted that the ground assumed
on this side was an entire abandonmsnt of a great
constitutional function conferred by the C nst tt
tion on Congress To establish this, he laid down
the proposition, that Congress w ^s bound to tike
care of the money of the c untrv Agreed , and
with this view the Constitution confers on Us the
right of coming and regulating the value of coins, in
ordei to supply the coun ry with money of pioper
sttndard and value, and is it an abandonment of
this right to take care, as this bill does, that it
shall not be expelled from circulation, as far as the
fiscal action oí this Government extends1 But
having taken this unquestionable position, the Sena-
tor passed (by what means he did not condescend
to explain) from taking caie of the money of the
country to the right of establish ng a currency, and
then to the right it estaohsmng a bank eu""mcy,
as I understood him On both of th se points I
leave him tn the hands of the Senator fiom Penn-
sylvania, (Mi Buchinan,) who, in an able and
constitutional aigument, completely demolished, m
my judgment, the position assumed by the Senator
from Massachusetts I tejo'ce to hear such an
argument (rom such a quartet The return of the
great State of Pennsylvania to the doctrines of
ngi«i construction and State rights, sheds a ray of
light on the thick darkness which has long sur-
rounded us
But we aie told that thpre is no' gold and si vei
enough to fill the channels of circulation, and that
prices would fall Be it so What is that compared
to the dangers wh'ch menace on the opposite side'
But are uve so ceitam that ihete is not a sufficiency

true that our supply is iniuflicient at picsent Ho 
could it be otherwise1 Tne bank ng system has
degraded and evpeHed the metals—driven them to
foreign lands—closed the mines, and converted

But, Mr President, I am not driven to such al-

he kbby of th« Senate
lernauves I am not the enemv, but the fríen ! of
credit—not as the substitute, but the associate and
the assistant of the metals In that capacity I hold
credit to possess,m many inspects, a vast superior-
ity over the metals themselves I object to it m
the form which it has assumed in the banking sys-
tem, ioi- reasons ih it are neither 1 ght nor few, and
that neither have nor can be answered The ques-
tion is n >t whether credit can be dispensed with,
but what is us best possible form—the most stable,
tht least liable to abuse, and the most convenient
and cheap I threw rut some id^as on this impor-
tan* sabject in my openmg remarks I have heard
nothing to change my opinion I believe that
Government ciedit, in the form I suggested com-
bines all the requ site qualities o a ciedit circ lla-
tion in the highest degree and also that Govern-
ment ought not to use any othei ciedit but its own
in its financial operations Wnen the Senator from
Massachusetts made his attack on my s igges ions,
I was disappointed I expected ariumi 11, and he
gave us denunciation li is often easy to denounce,
when it is hard to refute, and when that Senator
gives denunciations, instead of arguments, 1 con-
clude that it is because the one is plenty, and the
other scarce
We are tokl the form I suggested is but a repeti-
tion of the old continents! money—a ghost that is
ever conjured up by all who wish to give the banks
an exclusive monopoly of Government credit The
assertion is not true there is not the least analogy
between them The one was a promise to pay
when the^e was no revenue , and the other a pro-
mise lo rece i e in tne dues of Gov ernment, when
ther  is an abundant revenue
We are also told that there is no instance of a
Governmen pape-that did not depreciate In íe-
plv I affirm hat there is none, as tuning the form
I p opose, that evrr did deprecia e Whenever a
paper icccivable in the dues of Government had
any thing like a fair trial, it has succeeded In-
stance the case of North Carolina, referred to in my
opening remarks The drafts of the Treasury at
this moment, with all then incumbí anee, are
neaily at par with gold and sdvei , and I might
add the instance alluded to by the distinguished
Senator from Kentucky, in wh'ch he admits that,
as soon as the excess of the issues of the Common-
wealth Bank ot Kentucky wtre reduced to the
proper point, its notes rose to pai I he c^se of
Russia m ght aM be mentioned In 1827, she had
a five! piper circulation, m the foirn of bank
notes, but which were inconvertible, of upwards of
§120 000,000, estimated in the metallic ri ble, and
which had for years remained without fluctuation,
having nothing to sustain it, but that it w as received
in the dues of the Government, and that, too, with
a revenue of only about $90,000,000 annually I
speak on the authonty of a respectable traveller
Other instances, no doubt, might be added, but it
needs no such support How cm a paper depre-
ciate which the Government is bound to receive m
all payments to it, and while tno=e to whom pvy-
mtnts are to be madt be under no obligation to re-
ceive if* From its nature, it can oily en ulate
when at par wi h gold and*silver , and if it cci,ld
depreciate, none could be injured but the Gov si i-
ment
But my colleague objects that it would par-
t ike of the mc e-se and decrease of the re-
venue, ard would b  subj"ct ti greater ex
pansions and contractions than ban n notes them-
selves He assumes that Government would
irtcrea. e the amount with tlie increase of the
revenue, which is not piobable, fo the ->id of Us
credit would be then le?st needed, but if it did,
what would be the effect" On the decreise of the
reve me its bi Is woul 1 be returned to the Treasury,
fi<m which for the want of demand, they could
not be re-issued and the excess instead of harg-
mg on th  circulation is m 'he case of bink notes,
and exp( smg it to catastrophes like the present,
woi'dbe gradually ard si'e it y withdrawn, without
snot k oi mpiry to anyone 11 has another and
sin! mg advantage over bank circulatio i in its su-
perior cheapness, as well as greater stability and
safe v Bank paper is cheap to those who make it,
but dea1-, \rerv dear, to those who use it—fully as
much so as gold and silver    It is the htile cast of
its manufacture, and the dear rates at which
it is furnished to the community, which gives
the great profit to those who have a monopoly
of the article Some idea may be formed of the
extent of the pioflt, by the splendid palaces which
we s°e under the name of banking house* and the
vast fortunes which hav  been accumulated m this
blanch of business, all of which mu t ultimately
be derived from the productive powers of the com-
munity, and of course adds so much to tne cost of
production On the otherhand, tiiecreditof Govern-
ment, while it would great y facilitate its financial
operations, would cost nothing, or next to nothing,
both to it and the people, anü of course would add
nothing to the cost of pro taction, wh eh would
giveeve'-y branch of our industry, agncuUure,com-
merce and manufactures, as far as us emulation
im«ht extend, great advantages, both at ho ne and
abroaJ
But there remains another and great advantage
In tne event of vvar, it wou'd open almost un-
bounded resomces to carry it on, witnout the ne-
cessity of resorting to what I am almost disposed
to call a fraud—public loans I ha\ e already shown,
that the loans of the Bank of England to die G >•
vernment, vv ere very little more than loaning back
to the Government its own credit, and thi« is more
or less true of all loans, where the banking system
prevails It was pre eminently so m our hte war
The circulation of the Government credit, m the
shape of bills receivable exclusively wuh gold
and silver m its dues, and the sales of public lands,
would dispense with the necessity of loans by in-
creasing its bills with the increase of taxes The
increase of taxes, and, of cou-se, of revenue and
expenditures, would b  followed by an increased
demand for Government bills, while the latter would
furnish the means of pay mg tnt taxes, n ithout in-
creasing, in the same degree, the pressure on the
community Tms, with a judicious sysnjm of
funding, at a low rate of interest, would go far to
exempt the Government from the necessity of con-
tracting public loans, in the event of war
I am not, Mr President, ignoiant, m making
these suggestions, (I w isn them to be considered
only in that light,) to what violent opposition every
measure of the kind must be exposed Banks ha ye
been so long in the possession of Gov ernment cre-
dit, that they very naturallv conclude they have an
exclusive right to it, and consider the withdrawal
of it, even for the u e of the Government itseif, as
a positive injury I have some experience on this
subject It was my fortune to take a stand on the
side of the Government against the banks dunng
the most trying period of the late vvar—the winter
of 1814 and 1815—and never in my life was I ex-
posed to more calumny and abust—no, not even
on this occasion It was my first lesson on the
subject I shall never forget it I propose to give
a very brief nan ative of the scenes through which
I then passed, not with any feeling of egotism, for,
I trust, I am incapable of that, but to ll ustrate the
truth of mjch I haye «aid, and to snatch from ob-
livion not an unimportant poition of our finan-
cial history Ise  the Senatois ''rom Massachuse ts,
(Mr Webs er,) anu of Alabama, (Mr King,) who
were then members of the House of Representa-
tive s, in then places, and they can vouch for the
correetnes- of my nar-ative, as far as the memoiy
of fansactions so long passed vvi'l serv e
The finances of the countiv had, at that t me,
fallen into great confusion Mr Campbell had re-
tired from the head of the Trpasurv, and the late
Mr Dallas had succeeded—a man of talents, bold
and decisive, but inexperienced in the affairs of the
Department His first measure to restore order,
and to furrish the suppl °s to c?m on the wat,

constituted almost exclusively of (be new stocks
which had been issued during the war, to the ex-
clusion of the old, wh ch h 11 been issued before
The proposed bank was utiihor zed to make loans
