TULLAHOMA, TENN., May 1, 1863.

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector GENERAL:

General Pemberton reports from Vicksburg to day a furious battle has been going on since daylight. General Bowen, commanding, says he is outnumbered terribly. He has about 8,000. Enemy's army can cross at Bruinsburg, below Bayou Pierre. Lieutenant-Colonel [C. R] Barteau, at Allatoona, telegraphs to him 3,000 enemy crossed Tallahatchee at New Albany yesterday.

General Pemberton calls for heavy re-enforcements. They cannot be sent without giving up Tennessee. Can one or two brigades be sent from the east?

J. E. Johnston,

General.

TULLAHOMA, TENN., May 1, 1863.

General S. COOPER:

Reports of our scouts in Kentucky indicate invasion of East Tennessee by a strong force under Burnside.

Cannot our troops there be re-enforced from Western Virginia or elsewhere?

J. E. Johnston,

General.

[Indorsement.]

MAY 2. 1863.

Telegraph this to General Sam. Jones. Add that if in his power to render the aid, he will do so.

He must exercise his judgment in view of the circumstances of the situation and his own forces.

J. A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War.

TULLAHOMA, TENN., May 7, 1863.

General S. COOPER:

Both General Pemberton and General Maury ask for re-enforcements, and need them greatly.

It is reported that General [John G.] Foster's troops have left South Carolina.

Cannot General Beauregard and Major-General [Sam.] Jones spare troops to re-enforce Mississippi and East Tennessee?

J. E. Johnston,

General.

TULLAHOMA, TENN., May 7, 1863

General S. COOPER:

I have just received the painful intelligence of the death of the distinguished Major-General Van Dorn which occurred this morning at Spring Hill.

J. E. Johnston.
