APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
[Dec. 2,
31st Cong 2d Sf.ss.
Report of the Secretary of the Interior.
Senate & ho. of Reps.
the probable expense of this whole service was
$1,116,000. This sum having been appropriated
for that object by the act of 30th September,
1850, (chapter 90, page 172,) no further sum is
deemed necessary now.
UNITED STATES COURTS.
The estimate*for this service exceeds that of
last year $35,210, in consequence of the anticipa-
ted increase of business in the courts correspond-
ing with the increase of the population and busi-
ness of the country. The estimates of the current
year and the vear preceding were found to be in-
sufficient, and Congress was compelled at its last
session to make a specific appropriation of §>50,000
to supply the deficiencies for this service during
those years. Taking this sum into the account,
the estimate for the coming year is $14,790 less
than the expenditure of the last.
PUBLIC BUILDINGS, PAUPER LUNATICS, AGRICUL-
TURAL STATISTICS, AND THE PENITENTIARY.
In these several items there are no material
variations between the present and past estimates,
and it is not deemed necessary to enter into any
detailed explanation of them, as the reports of the
various officers charged with their management
will supply satisfactory statements iu regard to
them.
The last item in the estimate for the ensuing
year is
MEXICAN BOUNDARY SURVF.T.
The last estimates embraced nothing on this
account, though appropriations were made by Con-
press during its last session for that object amount-
ing to $185,000. The sum which it is supposed
will be necessary during the next fiscal year is
$100,000.
I have thus presented a brief statement of the
wants of the department, Tvnd a comparison be-
tween the present requisitions and the actual ex-
penditures of the preceding year. In making these
estimates, I have instructed the heads of bureaux
to endeavor to cover the whole amount of the
probable expenditure for the fiscal year. Any
other course tends to entangle the expenditures of
one year with those of another, and to throw the
financial arrangements of Government into inex-
tricable confusion. Nothing should be asked from
Congress which the public interests do not require.
But when an appropriation is ascertained to be
necessary, the demand should be fairly made, and
the responsibility of grunting or withholding it
left with the representatives of the people. If my
instructions have been complied with, as I have
every reason to believe they have been, I hope
there will be no necessity in future for estimating
for deficiencies, unless some contingency should
occur which could not have been readily foreseen.
Having submitted these general views, I will
proceed now to present, in a condensed form, a
few remarks in regard to the operations of each
bureau separately.
PENSION OFFICE.
The whole number of persons now on the pen-
sion rolls of tjje United States is 19,758.
But many of these are probably dead. The
whole number who have drawn pensions during the
first and second quarters of the present calendar
year is 13,079.
Many, however, do not draw their pensions'
until the close of the year, and therefore the last
statement docs not show the whole number living.
Th% number of deaths reported within the last
year is 846.
REVOLUTIONARY PENSIONS.
The whole number of persons pensioned under
the act of March 18, 1818, is 30,485.
Of these there now remain on the rolls but 1,523.
Under the act of 15th May, 1828, there were
added to the list of revolutionary pensioners 1,152.
Of these there now remain but 162.
Under the act of 7th June, 1832, there were
added to the rolls of revolutionary pensioners
32,788.
At this lime there remain of these on the rolls
5,247.
And of this last number there were but 2,408
who have applied for their pensions during the first
half of the present calendar year.
WIDOWS OK REVOLUTIONARY SOLDIERS AND OTHERS.
Lnder the act of July 4, 1836, pensioningter-
i! tain widows and orphans therein described, the 1
'! number who have been pensioned is 4,984. :
11 Of these there remain on the rolls but 1,118.
Under the act of 7th July, 1838, giving pensions
x to the widows of revolutionary officers and sol-
diers who were married prior to 1794, the number
of persons who have been pensioned is 11,002.
During the first two quarters of this year pay-
ment has been made under this law to 201.
The act of 1838 was limited originally to five
years, but was extended for one year by act of
3d March, 1843; on the 17th June, 1844, it was
extended for four years longer; and finally, on the
2d February, 1848, the benefits of the law were
, continued during widowhood. There are now on
the rolls under the last-mentioned act 4,876.
Oh the 29th April, 1848, pensions were given
from the 4th March, 1848, during widowhood, to
widows of officers, soldiers, seamen, and marines
who were married prior to January, 1800. Under :
, this law the number pensioned is 686.
It will thus be seen that the beneficiaries under
the laws designed to provide for the soldiers of the
Revolution and the widows of those who were
; dead are rapidly passing away.
! But, on the other hand, the number of pension-
efs under the acts for the relief of invalids and
1 the widows of those who died in the service of
the United States has been considerably augmented
j during the past year, in consequence of the war
with Mexico.
The number of invalid pensioners is now 4,742,
being an increase during the year of 627.
WIDOWS OF SOLDIERS ENGAGED IN THE MEXICAN
WAR.
Under the act of 21st July, 1848, and the sup-
plementary act of 22d February, 1849, and the
joint resolution of the 28th September, 1850, al-
lowing pensions to the widows and orphans of
soldiers who were killed in the Mexican war, or
died from disease contracted in the service, the
number pensioned is 1,456.
AMOUNT EXPENDED.
The whole amount expended for pensions du-
ring the past year is estimated by the Commis-
sioner at §1,400,000.
There has been paid since 1st November, 1849,
on account of revolutionary service of Virginia
State troops and navy, $88,060 30; and as com-
mutation or half-pay and interest, $138,543 44.
LAND WARRANTS REVOLUTIONARY SERVICE.
The whole number of land warrants issued to
commissioned officers of the continental army
is     2,826
To non-commissioned officers and privates..9,762
Land is still due to 111 officers and to 1,993 non-
commissioned officers and privates.
WAR OF 1812.
Whole number of warrants issued to persons
entitled under various acts of Congress for services
in the war of 1812 is 28,978
MEXICAN WAR.
The number of claims presented for ser-
vices in the Mexican war is  81,373 00
And for scrip or money, in lieu of hand, 3,332 00
Making an aggregate of.  84,705 00
THE GENERAL BOUNTY LAND LAW OF SEPTEMBER 28,
1850.
The number of claims already presented under
this comprehensive law up to the 5th of Novem-
ber, 1850, was 9,418, ana the number is increas-
ing rapidly—scarcely a mail arriving which does
not swell the list.
The whole number of persons who if living
would be entitled to the benefit of that law would
exceed half a million.
The Commissioner supposes, from the best data
wftliin his reach, that one half are dead, leaving
no person entitled to claim under them. If this
estimate be correct—and I imagine it will be found
to approximate accuracy—the whole humber of
claimants will be about two hundred and fifty thou-
sand.
It will thus be seen that the act of 28th Sep-
tember, 1850, is by far the most important bounty
land law that has ever been passed, whether we
consider the number of beneficiaries under its pro-
visions or the extent of the domain granted.
Deeply impressed with the responsibility inci-
dent to the administration of a trust of such mag-
nitude, I have sought to make the necessary
arrangements to insure its prompt and efficient
execution. Forms have been prepared, with am-
ple instructions to guide applicants in presenting
their claims, and assurances given that every proper
facility will be afforded for the establishment of
just demands under the law.
Plates have been ordered to be-engraved for print-
ing the warrants, and every precaution has been
adopted to guard against fraud and forgery. These
plates will soon be completed, and there need then
be no delay in commencing the issue of warrants.
I regret to say, however, that the law contains no
provision for the employment and compensation
of the clerical force necessary for its own execu-
tion.
Under the terms of the law, as I have been con-
strained to construe them, the warrants are not
assignable. The holders of them cannot, there-
fore, make them available until they havebeen loca-
ted and patented. This process will necessarily
require a considerable time, and it is therefore pe-
culiarly proper, in order to insure the enjoyment
of the bounty by those for whom it was intended,
that no unnecessary delay should be encountered.
To avoid this evil, the Commissioner recommends
that provision be made for th e employment of two
efficient clerks, with a salary $1,700 each, compe-
tent to investigate the claims of applicants. This
recommendation (except in regard to the amount
of salary, which is unnecessarily large) meets my
cordial approval, and the only* doubt I have is
; whether two will be sufficient. To guard against
I all contingencies, I would respectfully urge the
' propriety of authorizing this Department, in the
event that two clerks should prove insufficint to
j keep pace withthebusiness, to employ oneor more
! in addition, and such temporary assistants as may
be required from time to time. Unlesgi the De-
partment has the means of adjudicating the claims
as fast as they are presented, and of issuing the
warrants when they are allowed, dissatisfac-
tion and suspicions of favoritism will inevitably
arise.
Should Congress concur in these views of the
subject, I shall esteem it no less a privilege than a
duty to see that their beneficent policy is carried
out with all practicable dispatch and economy.
! PUBLIC LANDS.
The report the Commissioner of the General
Land Office exhibits some very interesting facts.
The surveys of the public lands have been pressed
•forward with commendable activity, and, having-
been completed in several States, the archives con-
nected with them have been delivered to the State
authorities as required by law:
Acres.
The sales of public lands in the year
1849 amount to  1,329,902 77
Area located in that year in satisfac-
tion of M exican war bounty land
warrants.  3,405,520 00
State selections under the act of 4th
September, 1841   259,806 60
Improvements of rivers, &c  135,246 21
Choctaw certificates  53,935 33
Total acres thus disposed of... 5,184,410 91
During the three quarters of 1850
there have been sold  869,082 32
Located by Mexican bounty land
warrants during the 1st and'2d and
part of the 3d quarters  1,520,120 00
State selections under the act of 1841 379,805 58
Choctaw certificates   46,360 52
Aggregate thus disposed of in the
1st, 2d, and part of the 3d quar-
ters of 1850   2,815,366 42
It is shown by the Commissioner's report that
the public lands have been a rich source of revenue
{ to the Government, averaging about one and a
quarter millions of dollars per annum for the last
fifty years over and above all costs and expenses.
It is gratifying to find that the business of the land
office is actively progressing. The accounts of all
the receivers of public moneys have been adjusted
to the 30th September last. A speedy consumma-
tion is anticipated of State selections, under the
grant of the 4th September, 1841, and for various
