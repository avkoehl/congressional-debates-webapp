Major R. I. DODGE:

For God's sake do not withdraw any part of military force from this county until after the 8th, especially the cavalry.

AUGUSTA, November 1, 1864.

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

At midnight last night an attempt was made to surprise the water battery at Castine Bay by a raiding party. Sentinel fired upon, but the garrison rallied and drove them off-they escaping by water after exchanging a number of shots. Similar attempts may be expected on our coast anywhere. Have issued orders to such military companies as we have to be in readiness to repel any attack, for which I ask your authority, and also for power to organize some companies for home defense.

SAMUEL CONY,

Governor of Maine.

WAR DEPARTMENT, November 1, 1864.

Governor CONY,

Augusta, Me.:

Your telegram received. Whatever force is, in your judgment, needed to protect your frontier from raids you have power to call out and organize, and the Department will furnish arms, equipments, and supplies upon your requisition. Major-General Dix having military command of the department, it would be well to communicate with him, and report whatever occurs, in order that he may render any aid in his power whenever an emergency arises.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

RECTORTOWN, November 2, 1864.

Colonel J. A. HARDIE,

Inspector-General:

Please ask the Secretary if there is any objection to my coming to Washington for a few days. I have both public and private business there that requires attention. I can send General Slough here until I return, if it is deemed necessary.

C. C. AUGUR,

Major-General.
