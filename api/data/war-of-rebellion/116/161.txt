know that you received this. I have written to the Fourth Auditor of the Treasury Department about his pay.

Yours with respect,

MRS. A. KEFFER.

P. S. - Mr. Cameron, please let the President read this or have it read to him, and as I cannot appear in person before Congress to plead let me beg of you or some one else to plead for me and suffering humanity in this deplorable case. Do not throw this aside as of no use, but do all that lies in your power. You can show this letter to any one you choose; print it, pblish it or anything, only so justice is done to the poor prisoners everywhere through the land which gave them birth.
