Mr TALLMADGE submitted the following,
and asked for its consideration at that time
Resolved, That the use of the Senate Chamber,
between the hours of 9 and 11 o'clock, a. m on
Friday next, be allowed to Doctor Sherwood and
Doctor Dwight, for the purposes of explaining and
demonstra'ing the discovery which the former con-
ceives, he has made of the laws which regulate the
variation of the magnetic needle, and of the means
of thence deducing at any time, by a simple and
infallible process, the latitude and longitude of any
point on ¡he globe.
Mr NORVELL rose to inquire whether the
Hall had ever been opened for such purposes be-
fore1 If it had not been, he was opposed to open-
in? it on the present occasion
Mr TALLMADGE did not anticipate any ob-
jecti )n, particularly as the hours were such as
not to interfere with their duties. The machine
was a most extraordinary one, and if it turned out
to be what it was represented, would prove a great
a"quisition to the cause of science
Mr KING saw no necessity foi granting the
Hall, if it were intended for the Senate only, it
m ght not make much odds, but if it were to be
publie, it might lead to the derangement of the pa-
pers and documento with which the desks at present
abounded That the machine was a very extraor-
dinary one, he was willing to admit, still he
thought that the granting of the Hall would be of
no advantage to the inventors or the public, while
it would lead to the misplacing of papers, &c.
Mr SEVIER said he objected to it If the Hall
were once opened, they would be continually pes-
tered by applications for abolition lectures, and
other things of that kind He was for keeping the
H ill for w hat it was originally designed.
Mr NILES, presented resolutions of the General
Assembly of the State of Connecticut, requesting
their Senators to procure the passage of a law to
indemnify the citizens of the United States for loss-
es sustained by them from the French, prior to
1800  Hid on the table
Also, a preamble and resolutions relating to the
right of petition, and requesting their representa-
tives to use their best endeavors to have the resolu-
tions of tne House rescinded relative to petitions
on the subject of domestic slavery laid on the table
AKo, to use their beat endeavors to procure an
amen 'ment of the Constitution ot the United States,
so thit the nominating, appointing, or removing
any officers of the United States, except naval and
military officers, ambassadors, public ministers,
and consuls, shall not appertain to the office of
Piesiilent of the United States, but be vested and
exercised m some other manner ordered to lie on
the lable, and be printed
Also, declaring it to be the will of the said State
that their Senators and representatives vote against
the Independent Treasury bill, now pending before
Congress, and instructing them to vote accordingly
ordered lhat they lie on the table
Mr NILES offered a resolution of the General
Assembly ot the State of Connecticut, instructing
theScna'ors and Representatives of that State in
Congress, that it was the will of the Legislature
of the State, that they vote against the Sub-Tiea-
sury bill
Mr Niirs remarked, that from the impor-
tance of the measure to which this resolution
refened, as well as from the peculiar cha-
racter of the resolution itself, he considered it a
duty to detain the Senate with some observations,
in explanat 0 4 of the course he felt bound to pur-
Mi , and the considerations which had influenced
his determination It was well known that the bill
leferredto, was now under consideration in the
other branch of Congress, or the bill reported by
the CommUtee of Ways and Means of the House,
and should that bill receive the lavorable action of
that branch of Congress, it would of course come
here for the action of the Senate And from the
known sen'iments of this body on the quostion, it
was apparent that the fate of the bill would depend
on his vote, and that of his colleague In this view
of the subject, the resolution he had to submit to
the Senate had thrown upon bim and his colleague
CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
a heavy responsibility. Of the magnitude of this
responsibility, he believed they were fully sensible
Deeply impressed with it, he and his colleague had
consulted together, and calmly and deliberately re-
flected on the course which they ought to pursue
under the circumstances in which they found them-
selves placed
The msasure in question had agitated the pub-
lic mmd for more than a year, it was almost uni-
versally regarded as one of vital importance to the
currency and business of the counuy, as well in
its bearing on the financial interests of the Govern-
ment. Its fate might depend on his vote, and that
of his colleague, the country therefore, as well as
their State, may have a deep interest in the vole
they may give, their immediate constituents had
no more interest in this measure than the country
at large, and the vote he and his colleague might
give was of equal importance to the whole coun-
try as to them It was this consideration, which
induced him to double the Senite with the matter
Under other circumstances, the resolution he had
to present would have raised a question between
himself and his colleague, and their constituents
only As it is, the country, as well as the State he
had the honor to represent, have a direct and im-
portant interest in the vote he might feel it a duty
to give.
His own opinion, an 1 that oí his colleague, vveie
well known on this subject, if at libeily to act ac-
cording to their own judgments, it was apparent
what that action would be Ought this act ol the
Legislature of the State to" overrule and control
their action? This was the question upon which he
and his colleague had reflected seuously and
anxiously, and with a deep sense of the responsi-
bility of their situation The result of these reflec-
tion1-, ard the reasons and considerations on which
those results rested, he proposed to submit to the
Senate and the country If there is any punciple
of acknowledged authority by which his vote ouijht
to be controlled, then the country, as well as Ins
State, is entitled to the benefits to such principle,
which, under the circumstances of the case, would
defeat the bill referred to, should it come before the
Senate If there is no such principle, then the
country, as well as his constituents, were entitled
to his vote, to bo given accouling to his own judg-
ment Or, if there be any such principle, yet if
the resolution he had to present does not come fauly
and lully v.ithm the principle, then his consti u-
cnts and the country had a right to his vote, pccoid-
mg to his own best judgment
The resolution he presented was of an unusual
chaiacter, and not only raised the general question
of the authority and binding force of the doctrine
of legislative instruction, but other questions grow-
ing out of the peculiar character of the resolution,
and the circumstances under which it was adopted
It  phraseology was unusual, he believed unprece-
dented, and, he was sorry to have occasion to add,
bore on lis face evidence of studied and intentional
ambiguity It is neither a request, nor an instruc-
tion, in the common language, hut an instruction
of what is the will of the Legislature But, on the
passage of the resolution, anamendment was offered
expressly asserting the ughl o{ instruction, which
was voted down by the same majomy that voful
for the resolution It is a resolution coming from
a Legislature which expressly denied all ryht
and authority to pass it, which, in the very act
of its pass ige.disavows the jinncip e by which alone
it could possess any authority, or binding force
Sir, (said Mr N ) to permit such a proceeding
as this to control his vote would be to suffer him-
self to become an instrument to destroy the pun
ciple of insliuction itself It would be to give a
sanction to a gross perversion and palpable ab ise
I of a popular doctrine, which, when properly un ler
stood, and fairly and honestly applied, he sincerely
] respected The Legislature deny the right of in-
I slruction, and then pass a resolution couched in
such equivocal terms, that whether they regarded
it as instructing us or not, it is evident they in-
tended, or at least supposed, we might so regard
it. He had witnessed such a proceeding with pain
and regret, and would not speak of it in the lan-
guage it deserved It was, m his judgment, un-
worthy of an enlightened and intelligent Legis-
nl .....I ,    ii'nn.....1t i    .,    Hun......... u   1     .......   "i "^    '    ■.    '         ' "i i^ii ir>
lature, and inconsistent with that frankness and
fairness which ought to characterize every act of
legislation
To present a more full and complete view of
his sentiments and those of his colleague, he should
be obliged to trouble the Senate with reading a
response to the resolution, addressed by himself and
his colleague to the majority of the Legislature.
He was awaie that from its length it would be
tedious to the Senate, yet the responsibility which
the resolution had thrown upon him and his col-
league, and their desire to place themselves right
before their constituents and the country, or at
least fully to explain the considerations which
would influence their action, he must offer as an
apology. The letter would form a part of his
speech, and as his friend from Missouri [Mr.
Bpnton] often tells us that he will speak from a
book, he (Mr N 1 would speak from the paper he
held in his hand Mr N. then read the following
paper, making some explanations and remarks as
he proceeded

Th'S resolution is couched in unusual and awk-
ward terms, the reason of which we might have
been unable to discover, was it not for the history
of the proceeding.
We find the following report of the proceedings
on this resolution m the House of Representatives'
