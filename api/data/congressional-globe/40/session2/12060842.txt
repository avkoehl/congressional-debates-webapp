THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
January 29,
Mr. LAWRENCE, of Ohio. I send my
Amendment to the Clerk's desk.
The Clerk read as follows:
Ailil the following as a new section:
Sec. —. That nil lands which may b« granted to
an> of the States mentioned in the first soot ion of
tins aet to anl in the construction of railroads there-
on. whether to carry into effect exiting laws or laws
hfrontier enacted, shall he sold hv such grantees only
to actual settlers in quantities not Rreator than one-
quarter section to any one person, and at a price not
exceeding $1 '3 per acre, with interest at six percent,
per .mtium from the date of the grant to such com-
pany; aud the Secretary of the Interior shall have
power to prescribe rules and regulations for carrying
this aet into effect; and no person shall be deemed
an actual settler who does not furnish evidence in
such form as the Secretary of the Interior may pre-
scribe that it is his or her intention to enter upon,
improve, and reside upon the lands he or she may
purchase as and lor a homestead,
Mr. LAWRENCE, of Ohio. Will the gen-
tleman from Indiana [Mr. Cobcrx] permit me
to say a word or two in explanation of this
amendment? *•
Mr. COBUKN. I cannot yield any further
a? present.
Mr. Speaker, I desire to state briefly the
reasons which influence me in giving this bill
my support. I believe that it is right in princi-
ple ; that it is expedient as a measure of legis-
lation ; and that it is properly urged upon our
atteution at the present time. I disagree with
the gentleman from Michigan, [Mr. Blair,]
who says that it is a measure of punishment.
I disclaim all sympathy with those who advo-
cate this bill as a measure of punishment. It
is a measure of reconstruction, not of punish-
ment. We are now inaugurating a series of
measures by which the southern country is to
be reclaimed and brought back into the CJnion
upon a proper basis ; and it seems to me that
this bill is properly one of such a series of
measures. Why? My friend from Minnesota
[Mr. Donnelly] has already stated that the
corporations of that section have been in the
hands of leading rebels ; and the object of this
legislation is not to inflict punishment upon
those rebels, but to take power from their hands;
and in this view I regard the measure as proper
aud right.
The gentleman from Michigan [Mr. Blair]
asks, " Why make the South an exception in
carrying out our railroad policy?" Sir, we are
not making these southern States an exception.
They have made themselves an exception. By
raising the arm of rebellion against the Gov-
ernment, by refusing to fulfill their obligations
as members of the Union, by throwing obsta-
cles in the way of the completion of the public
works for which these lands were granted, by
inaugurating and for four years prosecuting
war against the nation, they have made them-
selves the exception. It is not any legislation
on our part that makes them such.
The gentleman says further, that there is
no difficulty in obtaining homesteads in the
South. But to this it has been well answered
by my colleague [Mr. Julian] that the very
best lands in the South have been selected by
these railroad companies; and that the lands
held by the Government in the South are to a
great extent unfit for occupation and entry,
poor, barren, sandy, swampy, or mountainous. ]
These railroad companies were very careful
in their selections of land and were engaged
several years in making them. By referring
to the pamphlet which the New Orleans and
Opeiousas Railroad Company has submitted
to this House we see that they were some five
years in making selection of lands for that
railroad. The report of the Commissioner of
the General Land Office shows that the other
roads were several years engaged in selecting
lands under the grant. The selections were
carefully made, and it is to be presumed fairly
and justly that the lands which have been taken
in the South have been the very best there.
It has been well said that one man in four-
teen is a landholder in that portion of the
South, only a small portion of the whole. And
in view of the fact that the best lands have
been selected by these rebel corporations, I
think it is our duty to open them up to sale and
settlement, now that they have reverted to us.
I submit a statement of the Commissioner
of the General Land Ollice, showing the land
grauts made by Congress in the year 1856 to
the States of Florida, Alabama, Mississippi,
and Louisiana, and which have been forfeited
by a failure to construct the roads within ten
years from the grant:

Total acres      21,687,754.91
The gentleman from Iowa [Mr. Allisox]
asked a question in view of the forfeiture of
these lands, whether injustice would not be
done to those men who had purchased the alter-
nate sections reserved by the Government at
$2 50 per acre along the line of these roads?
These railroad companies have ten years in
which to construct their roads. Those who may
have purchased lands at $2 50 per acre along
the line of the road did so with full notice that
there was this limitation and this condition that
the road should be completed within ten years,
and having that notice in view they took the
risk as to the completion of the road in that
time. We are therefore doing no injustice
in not continuing the grant. I say there is 110
such settler as named by the gentleman from
Iowa to whom injustice is done by declaring
these lands forfeited. Whoever purchased did
so with full notice of the law and the facts.
Another objection is urged to the bill by the
gentleman from Kentucky, [Mr. Trimble.] He
stated that a large amount of this stock was
owned in the northern States ; that a large
amount of the property in these railroads was
held by northern Union men. That is no rea-
son, to my mind, why we should fail to carry
out this measure. But this statement is not
true in point of fact.
I refer to the testimony of witnesses before
the Committee on Southern Railroads, show-
ing that generally the stock in such roads was
owned South.
Mr. Buford, president of the Richmond and
Danville Company, testifies, on page 3, that
the stock is owned in Virginia and North Car-
olina. Mr. Whitcouib, superintendent of the
Virginia Central railroad, testifies, on page 9,
that the stock is owned in Virginia. Mr. Mor-
ton, treasurer of the Richmond and North
River Company, testifies, on page 15, that the
stock is owned in Virginia and Maryland. Mr.
Ravenel, president of the Northeastern Rail-
road Company, testifies, on page 25, that the
stock is owned in South Carolina. Mr. Ryan,
superintendent of the Charleston and Savan-
nan railroad, testifies, on page 29, that the
stock is owned in South Carolina and Georgia.
Mr. McGrath, president of the South Carolina
railroad, testifies, on page 34, that the stock
in that road was owned principally in Charles-
ton. Mr. Wadley, the president of the Geor-
gia Central railroad, states, on page 39, that
the stock in that road was principally owned
in Louisiana and Georgia. Mr. McDonald,
secretary and treasurer of the Atlantic and
Gulf railroad, testifies, on page 44, that the
stock in that road was owned principally in
Georgia. Mr. Hazlehurst, president of the
Macon and Brunswick railroad, testifies, on
page 57, that the stock is owned principally in
Macon. Mr. Peck, master of transportation
of the Western and Atlantic railroad, testifies,
on page 00, that the stock is all owned in that
State. So with the Montgomery and West
Point railroad.
Colonel Innes, who is the superintendent of
the Nashville aud Chattanooga road, on page 08,
testifies that the majority of stock is owned in
Tennessee; some of the heaviest stockholders
are rebels of the deepest dye. V. K. Stevenson,
former president, who now lives in New York,
controls the largest amount of stock. Mr. Sloss,
president of the Nashville and Decatur road,
testifies, on page 70, that the stock is owned
principally along the line of the road.
He says, on page 77, all that country was
opposed to secession, but afterward they all
acquiesced in the action of the State. And I
will add they were as bitter rebels as the South
contained. Mr. Owen, president of the Vir-
ginia and Tennessee railroad, testifies, on page
91, that the stock in that road is owned prin-
cipally in Lynchburg. Mr. Callaway, presi-
dent of the Tennessee and Georgia railroad,
testifies, on page 90, that the stock was prin-
cipally owned South, perhaps a third by Union
men. Mr. Tate, president of the Memphis and
Charleston road, testifies, on page 140, that the
great bulk of the stock is held in the South.
Mr. West, president of the Mississippi Central
railroad, testifies, on page 110, that the stock
is principally owned in the southern States.
Mr. Branner, president of the East Tennessee
and Virginia railroad, testifies, on page 115,
that four fifths of the stock is owned in East
Tennessee.
The published statement of the New Orleans
and Opeiousas Company submitted to Congress
is as follows:
The total payments on stock are:
City of New Orleans $1,500,000
State of Louisiana  650,000
Parishes or counties  430,000
Individuals South and North....„.    675,000
Total      $3,255,000
The city of New Orleans and the State, there-
fore, own about two thirds of this stock.
Three fourths of this stock is held in the
South and only one fourth In the North. It
will be found that such is the case with reference
to the stock of all these railroads, and that the
most of it is in rebel hands.
Mr. Speaker, the plan which the gentleman
from Michigan [Mr. Blair] and other gentle-
men now propose for the purpose of develop-
ment of the country, reconstruction, and recon-
ciliation is a new one. It is to carry on a war
four years against the rebels of the South, to
expend vast sums of money out of the Treasury
