Honorable EDWIN M. STANTON:

I trust the Department will consider favorably Honorable T. A. Scott's list of exemptions for operating railroads immediately. Exemption is the only thing now that will prevent an utter demoralization of the entire railroad organization of the West. It is now with utmost difficulty that trains are kept running; another week and it will be impossible so to do with anything like regularity and promptness,which is very necessary in moving troops successfully.
