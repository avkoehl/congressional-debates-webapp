The fighting qualities of the men I have never seen excelled, and in this respect I can congratulate the whole command without distinction. I have, however, to deplore a disposition to pillage and plunder on the part of some of the men and a want of proper officering on the part of some of the officers to check this tendency. There seems to be a looseness of sentiment (not unusual to cavalry) in this respect in the command that is to be regretted, as it adds no luster to our cause, but rather mars the splendor of their military achievements.

While I cannot mention regimental officers without including all alike for their meritorious conduct on these two expeditions, I should not omit the important services rendered by the officers serving on my staff, Dr. Rivers. chief surgeon; Major Wetherill, acting provost-marshal; Captain Asch, acting assistant adjutant-general; and Lieutenants Allis and Monroe, aides-de-camp.

The following is a summary of the killed, wounded, and missing, on both expeditions, viz:

Troops	 Killed	 Wounded	 Missing	 Total

First Brigade	 5	 29	 23	 57

Second Brigade	 9	 31	 4	 44

Total	 14	 60	 27	 101

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

AUGUST V. KAUTZ,

Brigadier-General of Vols., Chief of Cavalry.
