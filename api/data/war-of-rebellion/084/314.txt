out this way by this time. I have directed Lieutenant-Colonel Hynes with one battalion to move up the Missouri River by steam-boat and get orders at Kansas City. Two hours since Thornton's consolidated clans were at Plattsburg. The country is moving and somebody will be hurt. I shall take the officers from my U. S. Volunteer troops to command the militia now gathering. I shall go with them myself and believe I can govern them. I shall not put in service any company I cannot make obedient and dutiful. I have quelled the junior conspiracy in Captain Claggett's company and have the leaders in prison, ironed. The detachments coming via Macon will be of great service.

Can you send me 2,000 stand of the best arms to be had from the arsenal and ammunition therefor forthwith, under proper guard?

SAINT LOUIS, MO., July 21, 1864.

General C. B. FISK,

Saint Joseph, Mo.:

What troops were engaged? Why don't you call on General Curtis for help? Can he give you the arms I asked for? What have you at command? Please answer.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF KANSAS,Lawrence, July 21, 1864.

General FISK,

Saint Joseph:

Loyal companies forming near Leavenworth can share our arms and ammunition, but we have few or none to spare, as Kansas troops are being rapidly raised and we must arm them in preference. If another rebel force rises on your side all my guns will be immediately placed in loyal hands to help you. I am troubled with Indians, and feeling certain the bushwhackers are completely routed near the border I am going to look after the western portion of my command.

S. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.
