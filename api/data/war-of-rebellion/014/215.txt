HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, June 5, 1862-4 p.m.

ABRAHAM LINCOLN:

May I again invite Your Excellency's attention to the great importance of occupying Chattanooga and Dalton by our Western forces? The evacuation of Corinth would appear to render this every easy.

The importance of the move in force cannot be exaggerated.

GEO. B. McCLELLAN,Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,

Camp near New Bridge, June 5, 1862-8 p.m.

Brigadier General WILLIAM F. SMITH,

Commanding Division:

GENERAL: Major-General McClellan has received your note of this p.m.

He directs me to say to you that you will cause a reconnaissance to be made to-morrow morning in the direction of the Old Tavern, with a force not to exceed a squadron of cavalry and 200 or 300 infantry, to ascertain if the enemy is in force in that quarter. Under no circumstances does the general desire you to bring on a general engagement.

The general wishes me to add that until the crossings of the river are sufficiently completed he is not prepared to invite a general engagement. Any movement calculated to produce this result might involve disastrous consequences.

The commanding general will probably visit your headquarters to-morrow morning.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

[S. WILLIAMS,]

Assistant Adjutant-General.
