The Tariffs-Mr. Ramsey.
H. of E&pss.
to Which they have so largely contributed ? Suppose a mis-
taken policy should so shape our legislation as to close our
mines, and drive the thousands who now make their daily
sustenance by -delving in their subterranean workshops,
from-the employment to which they have.been accusto-zned
from their youth: to,what other branch of industry could
they turn their attention? how would the_ strong n^rv.e and
manly arm find employment for the less hardy dependants
on their toil, their wives and little ones'? What a scene of
misery, privation, and squalid starvation 'would mark the
triumph of that political party which should achieve the
downfall of our protective system! Hqw many groans and
tears and anguished sighs would ascend to heaven, and plead
©gainst them at the stern bar of retributive justice? Pause,
Mr. Chairman—pause, gentlemen of the "democratic party,'"
as you style yourselves, before you commit such an out-
rage on justice and humanity!- But, sir,,the limited time
assigned me in this discussion warns me hot to waste a mo-
ment in appeals to your justice, when we all know it should
be the guiding star of all. honest legislation. Let me then
hope, before a vote is cast which shall diminish the com-
foits or lower the wages, of the mining population of our
country, that gentlemen will reflect seriously on the mise-
ry which will be consequent:'jthat reflection, I am.confi-
dent, will be more potent than any argument J could adduce,
or picture I could draw. .
But the cry among the opponents of a protective tariff is,
that improves injurious to the interests of the farmer; that it
may be of advantage to the manufacturing and mechanical
interests, while it is prejudicial to the prospects of the agri-
culturists. Mr. Chairman, arguments like these cannot be
received by my constituency, who have experience to show
that the farmer is perhaps more prosperously enumerated
by the operations ot the tariff, than any other portion of our
citizens. In the northern part of my county of i)auphin
there lies spread a beautiful and Gxtensive valley, located as
advantageously as any spot the sun ever shone upon.
Once (and it is even within my recollection) its lands were
considered scarce worth the tilling, except^ for the family
uses of the owner; now they have been enriched to a won-
derful extent bp the coal trade in its eastern gorge, and the
neighboring county of Schuylkill, which iurniih a pros-
pexous, ready, and, above all, an unfailing market
for as much surplus produce as can be raised. From
the Susquehanna on the east, to the" Schuylkill county
line on the west, this.lovelv valley of Lykens lies extend-
ed, asfair a spot as ever blessed the eye, manifesting the
most cheerful evidences of prosperity—containing villages
and farms unequalled in neatness and agricultural perfec-
tion; flouring mills, forges, saw mills, and all the other at-
tendants on' prosperity.- The farmer's wife, in her dairy,
prepares her butter, which the gentleman who have framed
the bill would prefer England should furnish our country,
and therefore have reduced the duty; the daughters take
pride in their cheeses; the youngerones of the family have
the care of the eggs and chickens; all ofwhich find amarket
among, the mining population of the neighboring country;
and thus Lykens valley has become one of the most flour-
ishing parts of my district- It would delight me, Mr. Chair-
man, to have you, or some other gentleman from your re-
gion who are opposed to a protective tariff, as my compan-
ions in a tour of visitation to the mountain homes and ral-
lies of my constituents, that you might see one portion toil-
ing in the bowels of the earth, and bringing forth its hidden
treasures, while others were engaged in the tillage of the
soil to supply food and raiment for those who in. turn sup- j
plied them with fuel./ Sir, the admirable economy, the hap- l
piness, the content, and the cheering evidences of their
prosperity, would shake your anti-tariff notions,,and make
you a convert to the great principle ot protection.
But this is only one small portion of the district. In order
to show the resources of the three counties of Dauphin, Leb-
anon, and Schuylkill, I have, withgseat care, compiled
from the statistical census of 1840, as returned by the mar-
shals, the annexed tables, showing at a glance the intimate
dependence there is of all the interests spoken of, one upon
the other. My hour is wasting rapidly away, and I cannot
do more than hastily glance at the inference which every
careful observer would draw from these facts:

It will be seen that, in 1840, there were 1,683 persons em-
ployed in-mining operations; and that they, in that year,
produced 452,291 tons; in 1843, the amount of coal mined ex-
ceeded that of 1840 fifty per cent; from which it-may fairly
be inferred that, in that year, 2,500 miners found employ-
ment. In 1840, there were raised in Schuylkill county only
23,744 bushels of wheat, leaving a deficit of 121,521 bushels
to supply the consumption of the county, which, at the,
rate of five bushels per capita, would lequire 145,265
bushels per annum. In the same year only 85,855
bushels of rye were produced. Upon referring to
the returns from the adjoining counties of Dauphm
and Lebanon, in the above table, it will be observed that,
with a population of 51,990, they produced 492,676
bushels of wheat, leaving a surplus of 233,726 bushels, most
ofwhich found a market in the mining district of Schuylkill.
They likewise produced 350,025 bushels of rye, and-546,394
of Indian corn, more than sufficient for their own consump-
tion,- and the surplus likewise found its way to make up the
deficit, necessary to the sustenance of the large population
directly dependant on the coal trade.
Nor are'these advantages local. They are the same all
over the State of Pennsylvania and the same all over the
Union. According to the returns of the county commission^
er* to the secretary of the Commonwealth, there were mined.
in Pennsylvania in 1837, west of the Alleghanies, 2,000,000 of
tons of bituminous coal, not one ton of winch found its way
to the eastern markets. The greater part was consumed for
manufacturing or domestic purposes at home,-and a small
portion was sent down the Ohio and Mississippi rivers. Ex-
tensive deposites of coal are also spread through Maryland
and Virginia, all of which require numerous miners, who, m
turn, afford a large and available home market for the
farmer. . ,,
The Virginia memorial presented to the twenty-seventh
Congress shows the increase of the Virginia coal trade from
1 350,000 to 4,000,000 in 1853, and that it was reduced to
a!u00,000 bushels in 1841; and it also shows that the impor-
tation of foreign coal swelled up from 966,644 bushels m
1822, to 5,000,000 in 1839, under the operation of the reduc-
tion of duties oh that article. The memorialists say:
"By these tables it will be seen that the consumption of
bituminous coal has been very regularly increasing; that,
prior to the reduction of duty produced by the compromise
act, this increase was shared by the domestic producer and
the importer: and that, under the influence of that reduction,
the latter has nearly engrossed the market. During the four
years preceding the reduction, the domestic producer fur-
nished nearly two-thirds of the whole supply. During the
last fouryears his position is reversed, and he is hardly ad-
mitted to a share of one-third; and they say that if the du-
ties are brought down to twenty per cent, it will be impos
sible for them to continue the business "
But, Mr.-^Chairman, as an answer to the known fact that
high duties produce low prices, it has been asked, why,
then, do producers" desire a tariff ? ' I cannot better reply
than in the language of'the eleventh annual repertmadeby '
tlie Board of Trade of the" Coal Miners' Association - qF
Schuylkill county.- -That intelligent body *)f practical busi-
ness men say that "confidence in the sufficiency of- tfce:rate
of duties for protection, and in the stability'of sucq impo&tsV
brings into operation an enduring competition among our
own .citizens, and thus .operates in reducing prices jJSiP, that,
now, tke-cost of a ton of coal in either of the eities^ofPljil-'
adelphia, New York, and Boston, is three dollars less than
the average price was three years since.
"In fact, the competition is-so steady and ©lose, that little „
or nothing is now made by the business of mining in g6.n^
eral; and it is only .in favorable locations," with, superior
mines, and a very-economical working, that any profit can
be found at the close of the year by^the operators, and many
have lost all they possessed by this hazardous business."
Here, then, it is evident that the present tariff ,has not on
ly reduced prices, but reduced them so low as to afford scant
remuneration to the collier. If, then, you destroy our home
coal trade, the foreign market will again obtain command of
our home market; and, after the now thriving hives of in-
dustry shall have been made desolate—the coal drifts and .
mines have become the dwellings of owls and bats, our ca- .
nals stagnant pools, and o.ur railroads rotten from, disuse— ,
when the millions invested to bring'the trade into action
shall have been irrecoverably sunk,—then prices will go.
up again; for .we have then no competitors for the traae,
and' a monopoly of our home market will be enjoyed by
the hobility and' gentry of England, wliile every cap- ;
italist who was" connected with the American coal *
trade will hav§ been ruined, and every miner and laborer
have been forced to begin life anew and learn some employ-
ment or trade different from that to which he was brought
up. On the other hand, give us a permanent tariff and a
stable policy, and we can preserve the supply of the market;
we can go more extensively into business; our estimates
can be made to long periods and small profits, and a full, ,
unflinching supply can always be kept in the Atlantrc-cites.
But our very vitality is the permanency of any tariff^ If
fluctuation afiects the manufacturer, such is the sensitive-
ness of our whole system that every part feels it. My dis-
trict sends to Lowell alone 12,500'tons of coal per annum: ;
Boston received in 1842, above 90.000 tons, and in 1843 it had
increased to 117,451 tons. If we know that a permanent de-
mand to that amount is created, we can be prepared, and
sell for low prices; but if rash, unwise, and ruinous legisla- ^
tion causes fluctuations in revenue laws, there will be conse- ^
quently fluctuations in price, equally disastrous to the COO- -
sumer and to the producer. - ~
But it may be argued that the coal interest embraces but
a comparatively small portion of our population. Sir," it is
true that-trade is yet in its infancy; but! will refer you to
the immense magnitude and importance of the coal trade of
Great Britain, as exhibited in the Encyclopedia Britannic®,
Vol. 15, page 243, from which', we may foreshadow the
extent ours might attain under a proper system of pjat-
Scarcely possible to exaggerate the advantages which
England derives from her immense beds of coal. In mis
climate fuel ranks amongstthe principal necessaries pf life;
Without an abundant supply of it, the^oimtry would be un-
inhabitable. . , __ V
"And it is to the.coal mines we are indebted for a suffici-
ency of thin indispensable article at a cheap rate. Nor "is
the advantage here stated the only one which we derive
from these mines. They are the principal source of our -
manufacturing and commercial prosperity. And theirprod-
ucts constitute the materia -prima of our superiorityall.
the most extensive and important departments of industry.
"Since the invention of the steam engine, coal hasbecome
of the higest importance as the means of generating the
moving power; and no nation, if scantily supplied with
this mineral however favorable it may be circumstanced m
other respects, can ever expect to rival those which are so
in most branches of manufacturing industry.
"To what else are we to ascribe the astonishing increase -
of Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds, Sheffield, in England,
not to mention Glasgow and Paisley, m Scotland, and the
comparatively stationary or decline state of Canterbury,
Winchester, Salisbury, and other towns, except to the abun-
dance and cheapness of coal in the North, and its scarcity
and consequent high price in the South.
"The citizens of Manchester, Glasgow, and other places
similarly circumstanced, are enabled, at a comparatively
small expense, to put in motion the most powerful and
complicated machinery, and to produce results which are
altogether beyond the reach of those who do not possess
the fame command of this mineral. _ Coal has been fiappily
defined "hoarded labor "and it might, with equal justice,
Se denominated concentrated power. By means of it our
manufacturers are supplied with a power of easy control,
yet of boundless energy; and are abl,e to overcome difficul-
ties insurmountable by those who happen to be less hber-
allv supplied with this truly invaluable mineral..
■"it is uncertain when coal began to be first used as fuel,
although, as early as th^year 1381, Newcastle seems to have
had solie trade hi this article. In the reign of EdwardI the
First, its use was prohibited m London, on account of the
smoke which was supposed to be injurious; and aftenvards
this prohibition was renewed at different^periods, but wjth-
out any efl'ect. But experience proved that the smoke was
not deleterious; the growing scarcity of timber, and the su-
periority of cokl as an article of fuel, soon secured its a«-
cendency; and since the reign of Charles the First it has be-
come the only description of fuel which is used in the capi-
at most other towns and districts of the kingdom, ex-
SktagT^xS parts of Ireland1 and the Highlands of
Srot aid where peat is used as a substitute. Its use is now-
nearlv universal. The consumption of coal m Great Britain
is immense. It has been estimated at ia,^,000 torn annu-
allv exclusive of exports to foreign countries; but this esti-
mate Mr. McCulloch thinks, is under the mark. Aceord-
Eft him, the consumption^ Great Britain may be^sti-
mlted at the'rate7f a ton of coal for each individual, esclu-
sive of "the consumption in the iron works, and other great
Schef of mlnuLtures. Thia gives 16,500 000 tonsfor
what may be denominated general or dom>estic^consump-
tion, although, to be within the mark, we will take it at only
15,000,090 tons.
