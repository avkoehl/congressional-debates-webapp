HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS, June 8, 1864-4.10 a.m.

General POTTER,Commanding Second Division:

GENERAL: I would like very much to see one of your staff officers who was over to the Bosher house yesterday. I believe you told me McKibbin was there when the attack was made. Have you any reports from your line this morning?

Truly, yours,

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

HDQRS. SECOND DIVISION, NINTH ARMY CORPS, June 8, 1864-6.30 a.m.

General BURNSIDE:

GENERAL: The enemy have given up the position they seized last night, and fallen back, as near as I can judge, about 400 yards to the left. They are building new works within 300 or 400 yards of where I put in a battery last night on my left center. I have ordered Curtin to put his whole brigade on the hill at once and intrench himself there, Griffin to take up the old line on his left, and I will use the Second New York Mounted Rifles to make the right secure, or for what other purpose seems necessary. The enemy seem to have left suddenly, as they left the entrenching tools behind.

Your obedient servant,

ROBERT B. POTTER,

Brigadier-General.
HDQRS. SECOND DIVISION, NINTH ARMY CORPS, June 8, 1864-1 p.m.

Major General A. E. BURNSIDE,Ninth Army Corps:

GENERAL: Unless I have men enough to fill my line at once I shall be driven from that hill just as certain as the enemy attack me, and the indications now are that the enemy are preparing to attack my right again. I should have the Forty-eighth [Pennsylvania] in position in line with the rest of the division before half an hour, or another regiment at least 600 strong. The latter I could probably get the sooner, although I would prefer the former. The skirmish line of the Forty-eighth connects with Ledlie's on the right. If that line (Ledlie's) would extend over the ground now held by the Forty-eighth's skirmishers, and a regiment march out of the pits on Crittenden's left and relieve the Forty-eighth, I might get them into position at once; but I think that unless that line on the hill is secured before 3 p.m. we will have trouble.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ROBERT B. POTTER,

Brigadier-General.

GENERAL: I wish some regiment could be sent to take the place of the Forty-eighth Pennsylvania Volunteers. My line is entirely
