THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
July 22.
Mr. GREENWOOD. I did, sir; but as the
gentleman from Indiana [Mr. Donn] promises,
if he can get the floor, to renew the call, I will
relieve the gentleman from Ohio of the responsi-
bility.
Mr. GIDDINGS. Then I resign it into the
hands of the gentleman from Indiana.
Mr. DUNN then submitted some remarks,
which are withheld, at his request, for revision.
He concluded by renewing the demand for the
previous question.
Mr. ALLISON. Mr. Speaker, I rise to a ques-
tion of order. When the gentleman from New
York was in possession of the floor, he yielded
to me to submit an amendment, that instead of
the 2d of September, the adjournment shall take
place on the 26th of August. I thought my mo-
tion was entered and pending before the House,
but it seems that it is not. On inquiry of the
Clerk, I find the amendment is not entered. The
Speaker recognized me, and 1 moved the amend-
ment. It was received, so far as I could know,
and I submit whether it is not before the House?
The SPEAKER. The Chair did not under-
stand the gentleman to submit an amendment.
Mr. ALLISON. I moved it in a distinct voice.
Gentlemen around me are aware of the fact. 1
thought the amendment was entered on the
Journal. It was in that belief that I took my
seat. There was no objection made to my amend-
ment at the time.
The SPEAKER. When the gentleman rose,
the gentleman from New York was entitled to
the floor. The Chair did not understand that
the gentleman wished to move an amendment;
and no amendment was received or stated to the
House.
Mr. H. MARSHALL. If the House adjourns
will not this question come up to-morrow?
ThoSPIiAKER. The House having suspended
the rules for the introduction of the resolution,
it will retain its place before the House until dis-
posed of.
Mr. LEITER. I move to lay the whole sub-
ject on the table.
Mr. H. MARSHALL. I move that the House
adjourn.
fhe question was taken; and the motion to
adjourn was disagreed to.
The question recurring on Mr. Leiter's mo-

journ.

The previous question was seconded, and the
main question was ordered to be put.

The question now being on the amendment
proposed by Mr. Greenwood to the amendment

"2d of September," and insert m lieu thereof,
" 18th of August," :
Mr. CAMPBELL demanded the yeas and nays.
The yeas and nays were ordered. I

a very important matter; and while Congress is
appropriating money for improvements of this
character, I know of none in my section of the
country more worthy. I move that the petition
be refeired to the Committee on Commerce, and

tion.

pay op members of congress.
Mr. BUTLER. I ask the unanimous consent
of the Senate to introduce a bill; and I will state
in a very few words its purport. I have observed
that protracted per diem sessions are becoming
great evils, and a source of great expense to the
country. I propose in this bill to allow to every
member of Congress $3,000 for every regular
session, and for every extra session to allow him
the pay which he now receives, and twenty cents
a mile for going to and returning from home.
There being no objection, leave was granted to

pensation of members of Congress; which waa
read the first time.
Mr. COLLAMER. Let it be read through.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. It will be read,
the second time if there be no objection.

order of business.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The unfin-
ished business of yesterday is the bill (S. No.
89) for continuing the improvement of the harbor
at Racine, Wisconsin.
Mr. HUNTER. That does not come up in
the morning hour.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. It is the un-
finished business of yesterday, and if there be no
other business it will be taken up.
Mr. HUNTER. I understood that the bill in
regard to the guano islands was laid over until
the morning hour of to-day.
Mr. SEWARD. My intention was to have
that bill considered this morning; but the honor-
able Senator from Virginia, [Mr. Mason,] the
colleague of the gentleman on the floor, gave no-
tice yesterday that the bill concerning the protec-
tion of the guano islands would be brought up
this morning; and 1 suppose he will be here in a
moment. We are waiting for him. There isan
understanding between him and myself that that
bill shall have precedence, and then I shall call
up the others. I prefer to go on with the internal
improvement bills until he comes in.
Mr. HUNTER. I think the morning hour
should be given to the morning business. At
one o'clock we propose to dispose of the Sound
dues question, and then we can take up the river
and harbor bill. I think that was the arrange-
ment yesterday.
Mr. SEWARD. We were not to take up the
Sound dues question, but the guano islands bill.
Mr. HUNTER. I supposed that we were to
take up the Sound dues first,
Mr. CLAYTON. Why not go on with the
guano bill now '
Mr. BE WARD. We are waiting for the
chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations.
Mr. CLAYTON. But if no opposition be made
we may go through with the bill at once.
Mr. HUNTER. I think we had better take
it up.
Mr. CLAYTON. I do not anticipate any ob-
jection to it.
discoverers of guano islands.
Mr. HUNTER. I move to take up the bill
(S. No. 339) to authorize protection to be given
to citizens of the United States who may discover
deposits of guano.
. The motion was agreed to; and the Senate, as
in Committee of the Whole, proceeded to con-
sider the bill, which had been reported from the
Committee on h'oreign Relations, with an amend-
ment to strike out all after the enacting clause,
and insert the following:
That, whenever the President of the United States shall
have received satisfactory information that any citizen
or citizen; of the United States have discovered a deposit
Oi guano on any island, or other territory, not within the
