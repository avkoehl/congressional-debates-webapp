So the whole subject was laid on the table
Mr WISE then rose and withdrew his objection to the recep
Hon of the petition
And Mr ADAMS, in form, moved (m accordance with his
previous intimation) the reference of the said petition to the
Committee on Foreign Affairs, with instructions "to choose a
chairman if they should think proper "
Or, Mr A was understood to say,he had no objection to put
Jus motion in the form of that made by the gentleman from Vn
gima [Mr Hopkins} the other day—that was, to instruct the
committee to act in conformity with the prayer of the petition
era, because he (Mr A ) considered the gentleman aa having
jmadeuphis mind
Mr HOPKINS said, yes, sir, my opinion is made up fully
and I most heartily concur with the petitioners m the propueiy
of removing the gentleman from the station of Chan man of the
Committee on Foreign Affans, and am ready to give that vote
whenever it may be my privilege to «¡o so
The SPEAKER here Bald that no such motion had been en
tered on the journal as having been made by the gentleman
from Virginia, [Mr Hopkins ] The gentleman had submitted
such a motion, but it was out of order, and added, that if there
was debate, thepetition must go over
Mr WARREN desired to know if it was-in order to submit
a motion instructing the Committee on Foreign Affairs to pro
ceed, at then first meeting, to choose another chairman
TheSPC\KER said yes, there was nothing disrespectful to
the House m such a motion
Mr LEWIS WILLIAMS rose and moved to lay the petition
and instiuctions on the table
Mr EVERETT was understood to submrr that the gentleman
from North Carolina [Mr Williams] could not make such a
motion now, because at the time the ¡speaker had declared that
the petition, giving rise to debate, must lie over, the gentle
jnan irom Massachusetts [Mr Adams] was on the floor, and
would be entitled to it when the question should aga.n come up
The SPEAKER, here announced  finally, that the petition,
giving vise to debate, must he over
Mr ADAMS said he hoped the day would come when he
would have an opportunity of opening the whole subject, and
when the gentleman from Accomac [Mr Wise J would have
an opportunity of empty.ng his whole heart
So the petition, giving rise to debate, was laid over
But Mr GÍLLMER rose and desired to be informed by the
Speaker whether the Committee on Foreign Affairs had not
the power to proceed to appoint another chairman, without m
strucuons fr«m the Ilou^-e?
The SPEAKER snd that he could not take official cogm
zanceof any thing of that kind The committee, when they
assembled m their room, could look to their own rules, and see
what was the extent of the power they possessed
Mr GILMER I presume they have the power, and may e\
erciseit, without instructions from the House
Mr ADAM** Leave that to the Committee on foreign Re
lations
Mr. GILMER said he, for one, was willing to meet the le^pon
sibility
And then, in futher execution of the order of the 7th instant,
the presentation of petitions and memorials was continued, the
call resting still at thefttate of Massachusetts
Mr. ADAMB went on with the presentation of petitions m hia
charge, and presented a number of abolition petitions, some of
which, coming under the 21st íule, were not received, and
others, not strictly within the/rule, had the question of recep
tioo raised on them, and thawiueetion hid on the Kbit
É    PETITION TO DISSOLVE THE UNION

fiiCted wi'h the 21st i ule   (!ip being out, he sai I  at the time of
its presentation1)
Mr MERIWETHFRiaNed the question of ieception,inl
moved to lay that question on the table, remaikine, that he did
not think thatsuch a pen ion shou d be allowed tocóme within
the wallsofthisHoufe
Mr ADAMS sdid that bp was surpused that suchanobjec
tion should come from a quarter where there had been so
many calculations of the value ofthe Union
Mr CHAPMAN moved that the House do now aJjonrn, (as
signing a reason which, as the Reporter thinks, was that no
yuotttm was present)
Mr ADAMS hoped, he said, that the House would not ad-
journ. If there was to be a vote ¿licensure, the House might
a? well settle t ip question now as adjourn
The yeas and nays were asked on the motion to adjourn, but
refuted
And the question being put, the House refused to adjourn
Whereupon Mr LINN moved that there be a call of the
House
The SPEAKER announced the recurring question fobeon
the motion ofthe gentleman from Georgia [Mi Meriwether]
to Jay the question of reception on the table
Mr CAMPBELL of South Caiojina rose arid was understood
to say that he did not think that a petition of such a charactpr
should he thus lightly passed ©ver.
The fePEAKER said the question to lay on the table was not
debatable
The question was then taker, and, without a division, the
questior of the reception of the petition was laid on the
table
Mr TURNEY here submitted to the Speaker («o far as the
Reportercouldhear)that the question now recurred on print
ink the petition
The reply of tbeSPEAKER was not hea-d by the Reporter,
but it wat, uodeisfood to be that the motion to print was not
now m oidei ohiertio i having been made to the recep'ionof
the petition, and the pftmon not being, therefore, properly in
the possession of the House
Mr TURNEY (having, he said, misapprehended the effect
ofthe question just put) moved to reconsider the vote laying
the question ofthe íccqmon of the petition on the table He
had explicitly stated m the rust instance, that his object was to
have the petition rrmted, that the country might understand
what its character was
ThpSPrAKFR was nndrtistood to intimate toMr Tlrney
that, even if the voteshould be reconsideietl, the first recurring
question wou d be, not on the motion submitted by him to lay
the pent oi on the table and print, but on the question of re
ception laised by the gentleman from Georgia, and the motion
to lay the question on the table
Mi TURNEY persisted m his mot on
And the quesn >n now being on the motion to reconsider the
vote by which the question of the reception of the said petition
had been laid on the table-
Mr. HABERSHAM  moved  that there  be  a call of the
House
Mr   CHAPMAN moved that the House do now adjouri
The yeas and nays were ordered, and, being taken, were
Yeas 49, nays 87
So the House refused to adjourn

liesolied) That in presenting to the consideration of this
House a i eution for the dissolution of the Union, the member
bom Mav*arhusctts[Mr Adams] has justly incurred the cen

Mr UNDERWOOD objected to the resolution, as entirely
out of oider
Mi Gil MER 9E>id he would then move a suspension of the

'I he SPEAKER said this was not morder, as the House were
alieady acting undei a suspension
Mi GILMLR said he hoped then the resolution was in
otdpr
TheSPivAKER said that he considered this as a privileged
qup tion and referred to a case (hat occturedsome years ago,
1&36, m which the gentleman from Massachusetts offered a pen
tion fiom ct i tain slaves near Fiedericlcsburg, Virginia, and on
which octagon a rtbolution wis ofTeied by a gentleman ' om
