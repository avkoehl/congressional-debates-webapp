same as to all troops east of the Big Black. You will, however, inform General Bowen and General Forney of anything important occurring, and in turn you will be informed.

JACKSON, March 19, 1863.

Major-General STEVENSON, Vicksburg:

A company of heavy artillery must be sent at once to General Loring. Cannot Captain [D. H.] Todd's, at Snyder's, be spared? General Loring telegraphs the Peytona was to leave for Snyder's last night. You must forward him a full supply of ammunition for all his guns. What was caliber of last heavy gun sent him and when did it go? Answer.

J. C. PEMBERTON.

JACKSON, March 19, 1863.

General STEVENSON, Vicksburg:

If Hartford and Monongahela try to succeed in passing your batteries, notify General Gardner, Port Hudson, immediately.

J. C. PEMBERTON.

Vicksburg, March 19, 1863.

Lieutenant-General PEMBERTON:

General Stevenson went to Snyder's this morning. In his absence, I would state that the Hartford and Monongahela passed Grand Gulf coming up at 7 a. m. to-day. They were struck repeatedly. The dredging-boat [made] its appearance about 400 yards from the mouth of the canal yesterday. Three shells were fired at it, and it retired, and has not been visible since. The water fell three-fourths of an inch during the last twenty-four hours.

JOHN J. REEVE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Vicksburg, March 19, 1863.

Lieutenant-General PEMBERTON:

The Federal boats are at anchor just below Warrenton. The Hartford was struck ten times. The dredge cannot work at day. If we had ammunition, could prevent her at night.

C. L. STEVENSON.

Vicksburg, March 19, 1863.

Lieutenant General J. C. PEMBERTON:

Scouts from Deer Creek confirm report of yesterday. The gunboats are advancing slowly. Apprehending that such a movement might be made, I sent three days ago 250 men to Rolling Fork. I believe that they and probably Ferguson, with his artillery, are there to-day. I sent General Featherston with three regiments and a section of artillery. I sent a reliable officer last night to reconnoiter thoroughly. If they reach Rolling Fork before us, they may have command of Yazoo. I suggest that all spare boats be sent down and placed between our batteries at Snyder's and Haynes' Bluff, where they will be safe.

C. L. STEVENSON.
