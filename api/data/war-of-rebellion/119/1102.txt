POINT LOOKOUT, March 23, 1864.

To the BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS:

GENTLEMEN: My name is Edwin Young, second sergeant Company A, Second New Hampshire Volunteers. I enlisted the 22nd of May, 1861, since which time I have been in the U. S. service and have performed the duties of my office faithfully, in testimony of which I refer you to my company and regimental officers. For the past six months I have been on detached service at prisoners' camp as sergeant in charge of two divisions of prisoners, and as you are well aware it has brought me in contact with a great many different kinds of persons. I have uniformly treated the prisoners with kindness and with all leniency compatible with my duties as a soldier, and am satisfied that by inquiries among the prisoners who have had any kind of intercourse with me they will satisfy you that I never have treated any one with undue harshness or taken advantage of their situation as prisoners.

In the course of my duties I was called on last Sunday, March 20, by Captain sides to assist him in providing some prisoners who had just arrived with tent accommodations, and after fitting up a stove in one of the tents, I came in contact with two Confederate officers who approached me and asked if I could get them some whisky, using these words: "You look like a damned old whisky head," and "can't you get us some whisky.

" I smiled and told him "no. " He said: "You are a fit subject to be here," and asked me which made the best soldiers, "you or the negroes?" I told him "they made the best of guard," and in reply he said the negro was superior to the Yankee, and that all we ever knew we learned from them. I then asked him which way he meant. He asked me if I was a Bay State man. I told him no, I was a New Hampshire man. He said so much the worse, and I was a fit subject to associate with them, pointing to the guard who were walking on the fence. I then told him he could talk that to some men, but not to me while doing my duty. He then said if I did not like his talk I could leave, at the same time stepping toward me. I told him I should not, at the same time putting my hand on my revolver, drawing it from its case. He told me I did not dare to shoot. I told him I would if he did not dry up. At the same time Lieutenant Dunlap stepped between us, and told me not to shoot and to put up my
