In the execution of the crossing to-night be careful to caution the officer you place in charge of the enterprise to observe the utmost secrecy. Fascines and boat will be delivered at or near the reserve picket on the Lone Tree dike. Do not fail to commence as early after dark as practicable, and as soon as a lodgment is effected push over 100 or 200 men with entrenching tools sufficient to cover themselves at once. Notify me as soon as you are confident your party has succeeded.

Very respectfully,

GENERAL: The major-General commanding instructs me to direct you to cause parties to be at once employed in the construction of fascines, for the purpose of corduroying at different points from the mainland to the east branch of the Little Ogeechee.
