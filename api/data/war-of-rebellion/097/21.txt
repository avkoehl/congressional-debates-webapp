Major General E. O. C. ORD:

(Care Headquarters Armies, City Point.)

Colonel West reports that at daylight this morning he found it impossible to cross the swamp at White Oak bridge. He had just found a crossing, and would execute your orders at Daylight to-morrow or before. He says he cannot take his wagons and ambulances with him, and wishes authority to send them back to camp with an escort. He says we will certainly lose a great many men Perhaps the result will compensate. Has had parties along the Chickahominy to-day for several miles. All the fords are impassable; the streams much swollen. A scout reports our infantry at New Kent Court-House. He received both your dispatches at 4 p. m. What shall I answer?

THEODORE READ,

Sen word to Colonel West that he need not make the attack ordered in my dispatch of this afternoon, but remain between White Oak
