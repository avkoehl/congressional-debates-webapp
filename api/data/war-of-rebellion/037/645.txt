road, and the remainder of the Sixth Iowa were then deployed as skirmishers to cover the entire front of the DIVISION, connecting with the two companies previously deployed on the left. Colonel Corse then assumed command of the whole line of skirmishers, and continued in command until our occupation of Jackson, and I respectfully refer you to his reports as to the duty performed by the brigade as skirmishers.

On the morning of the 16th instant, by direction of Major General J. G. Parke, the skirmishers were ordered to advance and feel strongly the enemy's line at every point in our immediate front. The Sixth Iowa were then on duty as skirmishers. At the request of Colonel Corse, commanding line of skirmishers, I placed the Forty-eighth Illinois to support the right of the line, and accompanied them myself. At the designated signal, the Sixth Iowa pressed forward along the entire line, capturing some prisoners, killing quite a number, and driving the enemy into their works. The Forty-eighth Illinois followed them up closely on the right, ready to support the line. On getting into the open field, clear of the timber, we were opened upon by a terrific artillery fire, enfilading the line, and also by three regiments of infantry in the enemy's rifle-pits. Seeing it was impossible to make the enemy's works without a stronger line and support, I ordered the right to fall back to the cover of the timber. The left of the line(where Colonel Corse was in person) also about this time fell back under a heavy and galling fire or artillery and musketry. The entire line fell back in good order, and held the woods until relieved by the Twenty-sixth Illinois. Too much praise cannot be accorded the officers and enlisted men of this command for the gallant manner in which they advanced and held the line under the terrific fire. Every officer and man conducted himself so well that it is hard to particularize them by name. To Colonel John M. Corse, Sixth Iowa Volunteer Infantry, great credit is due for the efficient and prompt movements of our skirmishers. He was constantly moving along the entire line from the first day we advanced on Jackson until we occupied the place, and to him is due all the credit for pushing forward and maintaining our line of skirmishers so close to the enemy's works. Major Miller and Adjutant Ennis, of the Sixth Iowa, for their conduct and support at the different times they participated in the above operations, merit a great deal of commendation. Captains Minton and Bashore, and Lieutenant Holmes, of the sixth Iowa, are particularly mentioned as being worthy of notice in the last action. to Lieutenant Colonel Lucien Greathouse, commanding Forty-eighth Illinois Volunteers, for the gallant manner in which he commanded the regiment, I must return thanks; also to Major W. J. Stephenson, who was severely wounded. Captain Galbraith, Lieutenants Keneipp, Walker, Mercer, and Hemler, of the Forty-eight Illinois, for their gallantry, coolness, and excellent management of their commands while enduring a scathing fire of shot and shell from the enemy's batteries, are worthy of honorable mention; and to the entire command, both officers and enlisted men, too much praise cannot be awarded for the gallant manner in which they conducted themselves on all occasions.

I append herewith a list of all the casualties occurring in this brigade. *

Respectfully submitted.

W. W. SANFORD,

Colonel Forty-eighth Illinois VOL. Infantry, Comdg. Fourth Brigadier

Captain T. J. LOUDON, Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
