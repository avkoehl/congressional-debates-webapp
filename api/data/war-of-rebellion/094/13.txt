KNOXVILLE, December 1, 1864.

General STEEDMAN:

All quiet in this region. Rumors that enemy is coming down the railroad from Lynchburg not reliable. Telegraph working through by Cumberland Gap. Report is that enemy is on the road between you and Nashville. Which way is he going? What is the news?

Major-General.

WARTRACE, December 1, 1864.

Major-General STEEDMAN:

I have near 3,000 men camped to-night two miles this side of the bridge, and if you are coming up with a train I will send back a guard of fifty men to the bridge; a less number than that would not be prudent. My men will march at 5 a.m. What time will your train arrive at the bridge?

Guerrillas, about seventy-five in number, robbed Mr. Thompson, Government employ, three miles from here, between this place and Shellmound, last night. They started down Sand Mountain. I sent scouts after them this morning; also down the valley to Trenton.
