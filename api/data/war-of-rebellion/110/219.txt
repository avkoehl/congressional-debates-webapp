O'BANNONVILLE, November 23, 1861-10.30 a. M.

General S. COOPER:

The enemy has just reopened fire. We respond slowly. Their fire is improved and is very damaging to Fort McRee. We will probably have to yield it, but will struggle to hold out. Other batteries all intact.

O'BANNONVILLE, November 23, 1861-6 p. M

General S. COOPER:

Bombardment just ceased. Continued through the day very deliberately on both sides. We kept the ships at a respectful distance, and McRee has not suffered. Yesterday's damages mostly repaired. Colonel Villepigue is wounded in the arm by fragment of a shell, but maintains his post manfully in command at McRee. Town of Warrington now on fire from hot shot. Navy-yard not much damaged. Not a casualty for the day. Our troops in the highest spirits. Our difficulty is to restrain them.
