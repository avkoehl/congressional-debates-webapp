their first bill for revenue—unless he means to de-
siroy the lite upon which his system depend*, and
the only foundation upon which it can rest. A
bill, therefore, in my view, wisely constructed to
this end, is a revenue bill; and not only so, but it
is the only revenue bill 'hat will or can be per-
manently productive. The chairman of the com-
mittee was right m his designat on of it as such.
The question was on Mr. Calhoun's amend-
ment to the amendment, substituting 20 per cent,
ad valorem as the duty on cotton-bagging; and it
wag then taken by yeas and nays, and resulted in
the negative—yeas 8, nays 33, as follows:
YEAS—Messrs Bagby, Calhoun, Cuthbert, Fulton, King,
Sevier, Walker, and Woodbury—8
NAYS—Messrs Archer, Barrow, Bites, Bayard, Benton,
Bettien, Buchanan, Choate, Clayton, Conrad, Crafts, Crit
tenden, Dayton, Evans, Graham, Huntirgtou, Kerr, linn,
Mangum, Merrick, Miller, Morehead, Porter, Preston, Rives,
Simmons, Smith of Indiana Sprague, Stuigeon, Tallmadge,
White, Woodbndge, and Young—33
The question then recurring on the Finance Com-
mittee's amendment, to insert 34 cents instead of 5
cents per square yard on cotton bagging—
Mr. YOUNG moved to amend me ameudm"nt,
by inserting 25 per cent, ad valorem, m place of 3 it
cents per square yard,
Mr. CALHOUN read, fro-n a statement vhish
he had obtained irom the Tiea^uiy Department,
that the dti'y on cotton basgmg m 1840, according
to the reductiui ef the compromise act, wa 2
69 100 cents per square yard—«hich was equal to
28 21-100 per cent, ad valorem. Suioly a cash
duty equal to this was protection. He would rot
aigue farther on the subject; for he did not hope
by argument to put down a system whic i had be n
built up agawt atlargument But, h" would afk,
what principle was ther' for exeinp mg copper
sheathing for shipping, that d i not apply to cotton
bagging?
Mr. EVANS said the answer \ as very plain-
the object of exenipun  copoer thtatlun? was to
encourage the doing of work at ! oae, whu.ii, but
for this exemption, would be done stbroad, ar>d by
foreigners, matead oí by ou  own citizens.
Mr. CALHOUN sai I it was ju t «uch an an-
swer asheiexpected. Navigation, tnen,m tin coun-
try, could not stand against competition, unkis
sheathing were introduced duty free Hrrewas
an enormous charge upon the cotton planter—a
charge which wou'd benefit him nothing, he
would not get a cent more íor h seo on—and im-
posed too, at a time, when the planting in crt i
was suffering mote than <any o'her, as had been
well portiaycd by the Senator ftom Georgia [Mr
Cuthbs'Rt] yesterday.
Mr. CUíHBERr s¿iJ he th ited to edvei* to
one other point, which was, the eoormou  ra'e m
duty whieu five cent a yaid upon coHoa-bapging
imported from the East Indies would p oduc.
Mr. C referred to offirial returns to >>how vtie quan-
tity imported in 1839, and th" rate per >a>d at
which  was fumn led to the American purchaser—
nearly six cents and a half A duty, then, of five
cents per yard, wouldbeuprardstueignt/ per C3>it.

Mr. S1MH0N3 observed that the S nater frota
Georgia was g'ealiy mistsken. He held m his
hand the price-current of Calcutta for 1842, in

as Kentucky bagging; but the incidental protection
to the latter would be in its own superiority; for it
would undoubtedly be always preferred to gunny
bagging, at equal, or even higher prices He
stated, also, his reasons for preferring the ad va-
lorem rate to a ra'e by the square yard. He
called for the yeas and nays on his amendment,
which were ordered.
Mr. WALKER said the 25 per cen* ad valorem
duty now proposed would be equal to the Finance
Committee's proposition of 34 cent*, instead of 5
cents ps¡r square vard It would ba equal to the
duty of 1840 The imported bagging was then
6 786,889 yards, valu d at $723,678, a>"d paying
$200,418 duty—that of the preceding year having
been but $87 000 This was at the rate of 27 69-1Q0
per cent, wh'cn might be considered equivalent to
thp 25 per cent   duty aow propose I.
Mr. «CALHOUN explained that it ¡rou'd oe
even something higher.
The yeas and nays were 'hen faki_n, and the
amendment was disagreed to—yeas 17, nays 27, as
follows:

So the amendment was rejected.
The next amendT.ent was as fo'lows. in the pro-
viso eitenung the indulgence of existing laws to
railroad companies for iron imported for railroads,
ms'esd of 1843, to insert 1845.
Mr. BERRIEN etpiamed the objects which the
Finance CornmiUee had m vinw m proposing this
amendment.
He had heard, with pleasure, the general ex-
pression of a disposition to encourage domestic
industry, but on taat subject he had no sectional
feelu g?. He would, however, say that, if any-
thing required ncouratement, it was the system of
internal communication, 111 which the commerce
of the whole Union had «i deep interest.
The railroads in the Southern portion of the
country were coram r? d on the piedge of laws
thai iron used in their co'is'ruc ion was to be im-
ported free of duly. He asked the Senate to sus-
tain tliu pledge.
Mr BUCHANAN suit he had felt an urcsistible
repugnance 10 engage in 'he discussion of a bill
which they must alt be aware would end in noth-
ing. Ha had omitted, for this reason, to say a
word regarding the duty on hammered iron,
although he nould have shown conclusively
that the d,tt\ of §17 a ton wi uld not be equal to
30 per cert Cut thii did appear to him so re-
markab'e an ?rrt*id.n"i t, umsidei' ig all that had
taien place, that he oould no< oavt saying a few
words upon 1. He i jj'd not kay th^re had been
a compromise between the Smator from Georgia
and hun^elf, yet it was as much 'ike a compromise
as apuHap; that '^e had ever known, and one for
wh ch he (Mr. B ) had incurred considerable cen-
■mr., fo Fl nucleitoor, 1 uta'., ti ue, to a^ree that
Ui" pr v lege oí l-jtpoti t   ranroad iron duty free,
should < onti. ue u *il tne 4th of Match, 1843, and
1c hid asa-med to that, at a tims when he knew
there weij exte¿> ve preparations being made in
some of the d'strie * or Pennsylvania for the man-
ufar'are or the ?>'.e!e
No'v, what \>ps proposed to be d^ne? To ex-
tend that prni'ege foi tuo >ears logger, and to
permn iron thus ¡tppor ea to be laid down three
jeats h reafter—fus snmhilaling all duty upon
rai'nnd iron loi s peroJ 'ífi/e ycürs This
was th proposed prnetidment. And he would ask
(but ho "ippo^-d >e ji.sht ask in vam) if it were
ngh', i hi'e sil t e opentive classes x¡ ere subjected
to the ptt^wt ot a ¿uv, m some shape or other,
that tV railroad corapan es should alone be exempt.
Wny í'ion'd they be privileged above all others?
He had po feel g of ra'til ty towaids thoce com-
pan.c —very far irom 1, but he wctld say that
tney ougit at least >.o bi plpccd up^n the same
footiBg as md'viduaK Excl'uive privileges ex-
tended to them, would be clearly m violation of
common right.
Whit h=d the treasury aaeady lost by that un-
forunate act of CoDgre fl I* had lo^t, up to this
tine, ac-ordmsr to dt-caincn's. now lying on your
