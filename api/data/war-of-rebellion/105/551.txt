before whom the trial takes place? Still the brether. Who are the witnesses for the prosecution, and, more particularly, who are those for the defence? The brethren. Suppose the criminal should, after all this, be covicted and sentenced, there is still a pardoning power. Thus running a gauntlet all the way between the brethren (if they do not want him out of the way), what are not his chances for his life? Even though you have twenty armies there, has he any the less chances? It is preached from the pulpits that God sent the troops there as a blessing to the Saints. The troops scatter money broadcast throughout the land. All this in relation to Utah, but applicable to these Mormous. Such being the rulers, such the masses, such the oaths and obligations, and such the sentiments with which they regard our Government and people, what can you ecpect if the wholesome operation of our laws interferes with the absolute sway of the leaders, or with the interests or purposes or safety of the church, or with the liberty or life of a single member of the fraternity? What but the malignant hatred which baffled villainy must feel while it is yet impotent to strike? What but crime, when assassin-like it can strike unseen? What but open sedition and treason among the whole people wherever it has gained strength?

Major JAMES H. CARLETON, U. S. ARMY:

DEAR SIR: In response to your request in giving an account of the state of affairs in this and the adjuining counties I herewith comply by giving in detail what has passed under my own observation, and also the information given me by responsible persons during the past three months. About the middle of May the movements of some of the Spanish population began to excite suspicion among some of the American farmers who live upon the outskirts of the settlements. A Mr. Shackelford was the first to inform me of the fact. He stated that he waas coninually meeting parties of armed Mexicans who appeared to be engaged in some movement of a doubtful character. They on being questioned by him would give him to satisfaction, and were very insolent, which was new and strange to the general demeanor of that class of people. The Indians appeared to be somewhat disturded also. Mr. Shackelford lives on Doctor Edgar's farm, in this county, and [is] a man of veracity. At the same time I was informed by Mr. James Leonard, of this city, that the American population of Santa Ana and other settlements were excited about something, and their actions were strange. Some Americans had been endeavoring to raise recruits among them for the South, among which was a man by the name of Jordan, who had been the most active. Secret meetings were being held and the indications were that some extraordinary movement was about to pake place. I thought it was time that something should be done in order to distinguish friens form foes. A public meeting was called for the purpose of organizing a Union club and to bring the matter to a close test. I offered the inclosed resolutions. * After some debate those who claimed to be Union men adopted them, and others who were opposed sat in sullen silence. Simultaneously with these
