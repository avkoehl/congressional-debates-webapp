and report the facts. The world is getting worse and worse every day. It is astonishing what false representations are made by some parties. I beg, if any representations are made regarding my command, they will be referred tome and not allowed to rest until I am held accountable or am able to prove the charges incorrect.

We were all much shocked at hearing of the President's death, but were much relieved this morning to hear that the report was incorrect.

I hope Hood will meet with success in Tennessee, but reports indicate that we may be disappointed.

With high regard, your obedient servant and friend.

J. WHEELER.
