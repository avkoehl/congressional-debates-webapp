CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
turns of our country, as not only dangerous, but
absolutely destructive of ouriib-ity.
Mr. Y concluded by saying that, upon the
whole, it was a well written document, and com-
mended itself to the consideration of those who, at
every sacrifice, seem determined to persevere m
turning a deat ear to the cries of humanity, and
the warning voice of the Constitution ot their coun-
try.
On motion of Mr PRESTON of South Carolina,
the motion by Mr Yodng to receive the memorial
was laid up n the table
Mr. PRESTON, wiih the unanimous consent of
the Senate, asked and obtained leave to introduce
a bill to amend an ac entitled an act to c=¡rry into
effect the convention between the United Statis and
the Mexican Republic, which was read twice and
referred to ihe Committ"e on Fore gn Affaus.
Mr TAPPAN, with the x nanirnuus consent of
the Señale, asked and obtained leave to introduce
a joint resolut on for the distribution of seven Hun-
dred copies of the Dieest of Patents, which was
read, ordered to be printed, and made the order of
the day for Friday next
TAXING BANK NOTES.
Mr. BENTON said he had an amendment which
he intended to offer to the first revenue bill that
came up trom the House it was in substance the
bill which he had introduced at the last session to
tax small banknotes We are now raking and eras-
ing, fore andait, for something to tax, and a bill has
been introduced in the other House, which propose-) to
tax every thing except poison and physic, and afew
gewgaws. This extra session, which was ca led
for the purpose of relieving the country, has al-
ready got into the midst of a tax bi'l which
raises the duty on every imported article to 20 per
cent, many of which were articles that habit had
rendered necessaries of hfs While they were ihus
seeking articles on which to impose taxes, the
amendment he proposed would enable them to
reach an article heretofoieoverlooked—small bank
notes Hi  motion was that it might be pruned
and laid on the table
FISCAL BANK OF THE UNITED STATED

Fiscal Bank of the United States being taken up,
Mr MOREHLAD addressed the Senate at
length on the question of the constitutional power
of Congress to charier a National Bank.
Mi CALHOUN said that the Senator had sa d
much, and made many observations to which he
Would be glad to have an opportunity t > reply
But the time lor the "action," "aitior" which
Senators on the othtr side had so Kudly called for,
had arnved, and if action was not had on fne
measure before them tnis daj, it should be the
fault of Senators on that side of ihe c limber, and
not of the opponents of the Bank
After some remprks bv Mr ALLEN, da nog
which he quoted the vote of General Hirnson in
1819, in favor of th  poier of Congiess to repeal a
Bank charter,
Mr. BENTON,after some remarks, submitted a
motion for the indefinite postponement of the whole
subject, until the election of a Congic^s under the
new census, which after rematks by Messrs
WOODBURY and MOR&HEAÜ, was withdriwn
for the present
Mr. SIMMONS then moved a leconstderation
of the vote, which ihe mo ion to perm t the Bank
to issue notes ot a denomination of five dolhrs
was rejected, which wa  agreed to—ayes 27
noes 93
The amendment was then reconsidered, anl af
ter some remarks by Mr BENTON in opp Mtioi,
and Mr SMITH in fa /or of it, it was agreed to—
ayes 97, no°s 93
Mr CLAY of Kentucky then ro>-e, and after
some preliminary remarks, stated that it vas
known to the Senate, a d known pretty genera ly
to the cojptry, that the hi 1, in its pre ent shape
could not pass (he Senate, and v ere the -on' ti 'en j
it would probably stand 95 for ti t bilí an 1 OG
against it. Ualer these circumstances fo* i'h
purpose of reconciling the cinfl "' ug opinions in
the Whig ranks, a friendly consultation had
been had,  and   the   result   was  a  compromise,
in  which he   hoped  the  irienrS of   tn°   u.e^sure
would unite.
Mr C then moved to «tnke out the provision
in the bill relative to the branching power, and in-
sert the follo-ring

Mr. RIVE3 address! the Senate st much
I length in opposition to ihe amendment He said
it palt-red with lhem in a double sensr, while it
I kept the promise to the ear, it broke it to the

necessary and prooer, force them on you.
Mr CALHOUN said h° rose lo make a very
few remarks When he heard a few days since
that the honorable Senator from Kentucky had
undertaken to effect a compromise, he (Mr Cir.
Horn ) really felt a great deal of cunontv and no
little des re to find out imw that honorable Sena-
tor, with all his great fame and abilities for com-
promise, was going to accomplish his object en this
qtKS'ion But now his (Mr Calhous's) curios-it
was satisfied The wonderful comprom se
is disclosed) and «hat is the S^n/tor's pro-
position? It is ne iher more n^r less th n
that the consent of the States shall be ask-
ed through tneir Legislatures, a! iheir next ses-
sions for establishing branrnes of this Bank within
their borders, and if tnev did not dissen', lh"ir as-
sent should be presumed, and the blanches firih-

ihe amendment
^ Mr WALKER si d he Cd s d"eJ th s the mo t
dangeuus and lineons'iiutional pr< po ltion ev=r
made m either House ofC ngress What i,'he
question' Certain gentlemen considered that no
power  was possessed by   Congress to   establish
branches of a National Bank in any State, wi hout
its a sent.    Now, to   a isfy them   whndoesthts
am°ndment propose1!   Why,  that these nine sove-
re gn Bank director  had  presume  tie assent of
every State which shall not, at'he next session of
us   Legislature   after  the passage  of this char-
t r,   u> conditional y   assent   or   dissent   to    the
location   of  a   branch  within its  limits.    Now
you  were  c eremg  the  S ates,  upon  the com-
mand ot   this Bank, to speak at once  and for-
ever upon thi   great question, and jou were also
makmg c rtain acts if otnw ^ion or  neglect on
the part, of a Statp, prewired assent   But this was
not all; ihe propcsit'on was false and delusive, by
presuming an as-en1 in, cases, m wh eh, as shall be
siown, the State had aerially ais-en'ed    Suppose
under this amendment a btate dissents from or as-
sents to the location of a branch on  certain condi-
tions specified by the S'ate, as ft,r instance, the re-
servation of the nxtrg pover of the Sta r,or any
other reserv?tion.    What is presumed in such a
case by th s amendrucit?    Why, that tr>e State has
consented unconditionally, and that the branch may
be located   m    total   disregard of   this  re'erva-
tion     In other word , you  pre ume an uncondi-
tional assent in the case when the assent is condt-
t onal, nay, more, you construe a conditional dis-
sent into an unconditional assent.    You piesume,
then, in these cases, an absent of a Slate in the
face of conclusive evidence lhat ihe S ate has not
as ea'ed     Suppo«e,  under  ih s amendment, the
State ot ¡Mississippi, vr any  other State, passes a
resolu ion disserting to the location of a branch,
unless upon a reservation of (he taxing power, or
unless the branch deais only in exchanges within
its   limits      Is   ti ere,   in    fact   and   truth,   an
assent   in  this rase'     And ytt it  i    presumed
to  be an  assent, at d an unctnditiO"al assent to
ihe establishment of a branch untaxed and not con-
fined to exchanges    S r, it is permttng the direc
tor< of the  Bank at Washington  to  presume the
assent of a sovereian State, ma ca e and upon
conditions upon wntch it  aas  never a sented     Is
this a just ?nd proper mode in v-bich^i, Govern-
ment should  act  towards the sovereign St'tes, or
what is still more humiliating, a idiom" a board of
Bink airectors lo act in regard to the Sta'es of the
Unioi,   to   torture   their   omt tional   assent   or
dissent,   mío   ai   unconditonal   assent      If the
State   di sents   con tiiionally,   you make   it   not
merely    presumptive    but   conclusive    evidence
of iti unconstituuonal assent, a probaho probata, a
presump ion juris et it jure    Y' u reverse the rules
of ividence, and by a Ulse and arbitrpry construc-
tion, }ou declare this  conditional dissent, conclu-
sive proof of an unconditional a°sent    Sir,  wh?t
twelve jaiois unon their oaths  would dare to pro-
noe ic  such conditional dissent, in unconditional
as^eni?  And yet, wh" trio jury could do without vio-
lating th"ir radis and eveiy principle of truth and
moral rec ltude,  ¡'•is  Senate   is now asked to do.
Scna'ois cannot have reflected upon Ihe   conse-
quences of the adoption of ih s amendment,  they
sarcly cannot  bevillngio spread a naked palpa-
ble falsehood upt n th- journals of the Senate, by
asserting    tnat    to    he    an    absent,   which    is
in fact a dis ent     Sir, the mover, and  J'ose ho-

Suppose many of the States  denying your povver
to establish a branch of this B^nk   within   their
limits,  rtfuse either to   assent  or dissent, upon
the   ground   that   this   Bank   has   no   right   to
