one, and must not fail. With the occupation of Little Rock and the line of the Arkansas River all the country north is secure to us. If Steele and Banks succeed, all trans-Mississippi must return to the Union.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.

SHERMAN'S HEADQUARTERS, September 9, 1863.

General RAWLINS,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

The company of the Twenty-seventh Missouri is wanted with the regiment simply because the regiment is very much reduced in strength and in danger of being wiped out by consolidation. I think that all regiments, brigades, and division should be kept entire for the reason that by detaching parts the remainder lose their interest and consequently fall off. My experience is that the small regiments fall away by discharges faster than the larger regiments, because the officers lose interest in their regiment when they see it small. I would prefer the company should be in its regiment, and if we must work our white soldiers, which I think wrong, I would prefer to detach a whole brigade to work by the week.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

SEPTEMBER 9, 1863.

General ASBOTH:

I don't want those rebel bands captured. They are doing us excellent service. They are disgusting the minds of the people of Mississippi with Confederate pretensions and government. I know all about that cavalry, and we will thrash them soon in an unexpected quarter.

SHERMAN,

Major-General.

SHERMAN'S HEADQUARTERS, September 9, 1863.

General BUCKLAND,

Oak Ridge:

I wish you would gradually collect enough horses and mules to mount about 50 of your own men to replace those of the Fourth Division. General Corse will soon need his own scouts. Quartermaster Smith has plenty of saddles, bridles, &amp;c. I answer Mr. Hill at length, and my letter is now in the hands of the copying clerk. I will send it to you that you may read my views of the duty of the citizens of Mississippi at this crisis.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.
