waa'WtlUhahopa that, being re'ieved ftom embarrassment,
he might again become useful and active a  a citizen, but a
corporation was defum t, and never could ac  again
Mr X* believed that Coi ertss had no power to include banks
in the la*, butif they had, all thtse were so many considera
tion to show it ought not to exercised
He viould now offer a Jew veirat ks upon the bill lie made
them with reluctance, knowing that he differed from fntndswith
whom he usually acted, and towards whom he cherished the
highest reject lie had been t yiog to reconcile himself to the
bill, and even now he did not say 1 e should not v te for it But
in its present shape he did not see Uow he could do so He
■wished such a law had been passed long ago, then State legisla
tion mig hx have been made to conform to it, and the difficulties
would nave been far less than at present, when the population
and business of the country had sigieatly extended, and us con
cerns-become so complicated Mr T knew that strong sim
pathie&fwere felt foi the suffer ng state oí the community, and
such feelings were honor-tola to humanity, bit wis there not
great danger that untlei the lmrii] e o such teelmgs, men
might be hurried into legislation whicn in atootet hour they
might see to be unwise? Gentlemen ought to have then eyes on
future generations, si much moie numcious than those now
suffering under pecuniary embarrassment
Mr *f did not say mat Confess, h d not pewer to reheve
existing cases, for, in the worosof a great jnrst, ' it was dif
ficolt to say how far the powti of Pal liament did not ex
tend," hut certainly the moving cause to k gelation on the
general subject ought sot to be a regard to cases now existing,
at least that ought not to be the chief impelling consld'ra
flon
Mr. T objected to that poition of the bill which related to
compulsory bankruptcy, if it was intended for the benefit of
creditors, it was much more restricted m its provisions than
the previous act of 1800 If that was the true end in view,
why these alterations1 But Mi r was convinced that the
protection of creditois was no., the chief ob|ict of this bill,
that partofthe bill wis aship lobe used roeiely for the pur
pose of cairying the other pout'n wliuh related to voluntary
bankiuptcy But foi the latter he rather thought this bill
would have but few-advocates, theic or elsewhere
Now, as to theterm ' voluntaiy bankiuptcy,5' when he first
reads the words he did not really know what they meant He
could indeed conceive o! a man's voluntarily becoming a
bankrupt, piovided his object was traudulent, but, otherwise,
the phrase was mcomprehens ble to him "What would some
of the venerable sages of 1789 have said to this terml What
would Chief Justice Ellswouh have said to a man who talked
tohtmoC'voluntaiy.bankruptcy'1" Win evei heard of such
language before? Htrelof nc the i lea of a bankrupt was that
«f a man wh s priperty w t til.cn to piy his neditors
If a man had bo roue 1 inoi cy, and wis seCn to be squan
denng it the man who leaned it to htm m glu iiquire a
suuendcr of his pioperty to eicuie payn ent, a d on condi
tionof such surimdct, the debtu might bo discharged The
proposition always came fiom the lendei, the object was to
get his money back, and to di chaise the debtoi But gen
tlemensaid it wis a «Vol trge ol the debtor to be sine, but
not of the contnet Will, if Mi T owed a gentleman
$1 000 and In 1 given h * note fm the money tho acn'leman
might keep his no e in all its virtue, provided Mr T gothl*dls
charge It was said tb it the creditors stood in tl   nature of an
ltisuiei, that he believed the tlebtoi was able to pay and tha ,
1/ he was not, he must euriendei Ins property Mr T ad
muted that snch was the contiact as under this law, but it
amounted to adischaigeto all intents and j urposcs as ston
as the property was simtntlciel fvordilMi T iljectto

Il such wasthepiobahleopeia ion of the bill, corsideitd as
a prospective measure, how did it appear when throwing back
its effects i ncontiacis that weie past? Mr i lid not "ay that
Congress had no! powei to cxt upon e*r sting contracts, becau e
wien tbosp contracts were made tie coniiacters krew, or
m ghtknov, thuthe Constitution ^aveCougiess pcwei to pass
a general bankrupt law, and their cortricts were held to be
nude in reference to the existence ol such a uause ip the Con
stitution But if the consequences of tl e bi 1 were likily
to be dcletei lous in leaped to t'e fume, would tnei not
be ten times worse in nfeienre to the past? Thtie
was certainly great hardship m this reuospect vo action
Law was a lule foi men's aclmn, but how could that rule
guide a man which was not iri being when he aeter"? Mr
T believed his constituents were ut erly opposed to 'ins
letroaet ve power in any lull rhey were leaiy to conform
themselves to any law Congiesg might p'ease to pass
If Congress declared that there  hou d be no piocess
to collect debts, but that evei) man must rely on his i eigh
bor'shonorand honesty, weil and good, they had no obiection,
only let them undeistanri what ihey Vail to rely on but, aftei
they had conformed to existing law and devoted millions of
their propeity under it, was it fan for Congress to pass a new
law destroying then secuntj? Mi T as) ed that the time of
the inception of the effect ol the biP should be postponed, that
men might prepare foi it Th'ie was a provision pioposed
in anothei place that ihe law should continue in force but two
ytais he thought H woul 1 be bettei to decíale thatit should be
two jeais before it wentmto effect
Mi T conclu-ledby remarkirg tha- umki a sense of Ins du

should be vei y glad to see a bankrupt liw pa sed, Hit were in

that it workid oxtiemely well lie conceived that instead of
abiiilglnglhefieedom of speech, it iffilded an oppouunity to

have been excluded of j rest ntmg their views on this important
question With regird to the passage ofa uniform bankrupt

and it was so stated in relation to a National Bank Ivow so
far aslmnsiana was concerned, th >se suljecls as well as tl at

whom he had the honor lo lepre on here and thev weie tie
Cidedly tn favor ol it He bad told the peoj le o hied stuet tl at
he would vote asamst tue Sub li-isuij for a IVtional fink
and in favor ofa ¡reneial bankiuj t law These s 11 ments he
had trive-i utterance to both in the ¡state ai d g ntial eleu ons in
his t wn district
In red rence to the bill before the committee, he felt him e'f
bounl to vote foi it, although he ii eel) cot ft ed that seven] of
the amendments which had been oft red « ul I retene his
sam-uon He regauled lhe adoption ol a geneial harkiuptl^w

the constitutional rgunient on llm bill Vccaii e it 1 a I alie i y
been must ably dlsp ised of by sevci al of the gen tn en who had
precedí d him lhe sreater pan of his lift he had been en
giged in meicanille business, and his exj,et,encc had convinced
lum that the pass ge of a bankrupt law w u'd greatly benefit
the commi mty eelierally Nearly all lhe states of tl is
Union had pas el insolvent laws , an 1 in hie own h ate thfre
was an insolvent law which veiy much ie<-errbled this bank
1 upt act
Hut it seemed to him, fiom the necessity ol the cast that in r
forefithers hr-d seen that it was neiessaiy tl ey sJ10uUllia\e i
uniform bankrupt law, so that, when a man was disc targed
from debt in one State, and he remove í r another, he should
be fice fiom anest and lmpiisonment iiow, he would ask,
was it nowt Whv, a man inisb be 1 chuged m Louisiana,
under the insolvent law, hut if he e it m,o ano 1 er S ate,
where imprisonment for debt was not abolished  he might be
there imprisoned Ivow was theie any uniformity m this
couise oí pit eedi g? Ueiinaeined not But he liad known
