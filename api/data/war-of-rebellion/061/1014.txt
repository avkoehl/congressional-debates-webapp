JUNE 15-17, 1864.- Attack on Union gun-boats at Ratliff's (15th), Como (15th and 16th), and Magnolia Landings (16th), and skirmish (17th) at Newport Cross-Roads, La.

Report of Colonel John S. Scott, First Louisiana Cavalry.*
HDQRS. SOUTHWEST MISS., AND EAST LA., June 19, 1864.

GENERAL: I have the honor to submit the following facts: Having anticipated a trip to the Mississippi River at a point above this, on General Buckner's arrival here i accompanied him on the 12th with two of my regiments and five guns to Tunica, the point where he desires to cross the river, arriving the next day. On the 14th, I made a reconnaissance and sent in under cover of night two 12-pounder howitzers and 3-inch rifle to Ratliff's Landing, and my two Sawyer guns to Como, about 3 miles above. At the former landing I encountered the Numbers 53 tin-clad, which was so seriously injured that I have since learned she was grounded on Cat Island Bar. Their best tin-clad (the Bragg) held Como Landing, she lying near enough to the bank for use of sharpshooters, who were effectual in keeping her men from her principal guns, which were fore and aft on deck, and was only relieved from destruction by a monitor which lay at Tunica Landing, 3 miles above. On her approach my guns were withdrawn. The Bragg still holding her position, i determined on the next day to concentrate all guns against her, which was effectually done without their knowledge. At 1 a. m. I opened on her, firing 42 shots, 32 of which took effect, so completely disabling her that she had to be towed off by the monitor, who came again to her relief. During the engagement she succeeded in firing but 3 shots.

My ammunition for the rifled gun having nearly given out, I sent two 12-pounder howitzers and two Napoleons to Magnolia Landing, about 7 miles above Port Hudson, where we arrived at night. Soon after my guns were placed in position, the Landis, a Government transport, came steaming down within 100 yards of the shore. In consequence of inferior quality of friction primers the guns failed to fire in battery. Some 7 shots, however, were fired, during which time the boat signaled her distress, and two gun-boats dropped down from Bayou Sara, 3 miles above. Having only smooth-bores, my guns withdrew. On my march the next day down the Baton Rouge road, at Mrs. Newport's cross-roads, within 7 miles of Port Hudson, a force of infantry and cavalry from that place wa most handsomely repulsed by major Ogden.

From my experience since here I have but little hesitation in saying that with guns of a proper caliber gun-boats can be made very scarce, particularly tin-clads. My 9-pounder Napoleon guns I consider a complete failure, and but little or no service, the carriages being too light. During the time I was operating above I had Colonel Powers in the neighborhood of Baton Rouge for the purpose of occupying the enemy, who are in large force, and at the same time to sack some few Government plantations in that vicinity. In consequence of the high waters of the Comite nothing could be effected. With the exception of a few slight wounds, I have sustained no injury during the different engagements.
