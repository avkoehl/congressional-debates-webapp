THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Jan. 10,
If the proviso of the gentleman from Tennessee 1
fMr. J 0Nf>s] was retained, the consequence would
be that we should be without the means of trans- '
porting the mail fiorn Petersburg south; for while
we had in the bay line a competitor with the rail-
road line from this cay to Richmond , after we get
to Petersburg there is no competition whatever
with the^railro.uh and if the Petersburg and Wil-
mington road should say that they would not carry
the mail for less than S237 50 per mile, this whole
mail must be transported by post-coaches, which
would cost a great deul more, while the cars con-
tinued to run u>carry the travellers He repeated,
that while he was for limiting this compensation
to the smallest reasonable amount, yet he con-
sidered it was puliev to give a fair and liberal com-
pensation to these rnpds, with a view ofkeeping
un these lines of communication from here to New
Orleans, which, at some futute time, might be of
such essential service to the country.
Mr. DUER, inquired how much increase of com-
pensation the gentleman proposed over the present
rates r
Mr. 1VIEA.DE. None. He proposed the same
price which was offered by the Postmaster Gen-
eral, and about >13 less tban the railroad had re-
ceived previously.
It was the policy of the resolution which he
offered as a substitute to disconnect the railroad
from the steamboat altogether, and, by so doin^,
we could have the mail transported from this city
to Aquia creek for $5,000, instead of $13,000, which
was now paid. And, as he said yesterday, the
Postmaster General, if he had committed any error
at all, had committed it m suO'eiing the railroad
company to connect itself wnhthe steamboat com-
pany in disregard of its charter.
?4r. JONES, of Tennessee, mo^d to amend the
substitute of Mr. Meade by striking out the pio-
vislon for an additional compensation of 15 per
cent, for night service.
Mr. MEADE said that 15 per cent was a re-
duction from 25 per cent, which the Postmaster
General was now authorized to pay.
Mr. JONES briefly advocated his amendment.
He said that he made this motion because he was
opposed to allowing additional compensation for
night service. The mail is carried from Peters-
burg, Virginia, to Weldon, Pvortn Carolina, both
wavs, in the n ?ht; also, from Aususta, Georgia,
to Ataiaira, in the same State, a UiPtence of 171
miles, both wavs, in the n.rriit; p.nd yet no addi-
tional compensation is p^m to either of them in
consideration of this night service. I am aware
that it has been said, on behalf of the Richmond
and Fredericksburg company, that it is an advan-
tage to the comnany to run the mail train in the
ni<rht, as it will not then interfere with the burden
trains on the road. Mr. J. said that he was sur-
prised to learn that the gentleman from Virginia,
[Mr. Gogcik,] from his remarKS this morning,
had fallen into the same error as to the advantage
of nisrht or day ser\ice, but upon far more erro-
neous reasoning. If I understood tiie gentleman
aiight, he said the company owning the road
from Petersburg to YVeldon is composed of slave-
holders; that, in the daytime, those sk-ves w^re
engaged m the woods in procuring wood, and in
the night thev attended at the stations, to supply
the twins wv.h fuel and water, and thus the ex-
pense of a double set of hands is avoided. I am
a southern man myself—have been accustomed to
slavery all my life; and, so far as my knowledge
extends, it is the custom in the South, in the em-
ployment of slaves—as I presume it is where f>ee
labor is employed—in all eases where the business
engaged m requires hcinds day and wsht, that a
double set of hands is employed; and nowhere in
the South have I ever hoard that the some hands
were emoloyed by day and ni^ht in any easiness
by their owners. I do not live in the neighbor-
hood of a radicad: Imf I doubt rot that th*sc rad-
ioed companies as well as everybody else, under
similar cir-'um^tances, employ one set of hands
for day aervic-j anu another set of hands for night
service. I a-ii assured hy gentlemen around me,
who live iii the vjnmty of those southern rail-
roads, that such js the fact. I hope my amend-
ment will be adopted.
The question being tsken on Mr. Meade's sub-
stitute, it was rejected.
Mr. GOGGIN in« ved to amend the resolution
so as to substitute the following:
Whereas it is ifce du.y of the Postmaster General to pro-
vide for due ceiurity. certnintv, and security in the trans-
portation of the mail, in order to lelrve lam fmm any em-
turra>smeiiu> under which he may labor by reason of exist-
ing Jaws (a- he construes- them) or tlio u-tiges ot his do-
; pirtment.a-uhej are now said to exist:
Be it icsslred l<y (he Senate and House ol Representative* of
ike United States of ~lmerica in Confess assemlh-d, That
. the Postmaster General he, and he is herein*, authorized to
lentw t'ae engagements heretofore exi.-tnn* for the tians-
pomtion of the great northern and fonthein mail by the
Richmond, Fredejuk^tang. and Po'omac Rruhoad and
Steamboat Cumjinm,at a pnee not les* than that which
ha- been paul bv the pre.-ent Postma-tei General, as well
as his predecessor*, tor the regular and c-ati-tactory uas-
portation of the paid mail up to the month of July lus-t.
Disagreed to by tellers: Ayes 49, noes 107.
Mr. ROCKWELL, of Connecticut, moved that
the committee rise and report the follow ing rec-
ommendation to the House:
•' Tnat it be recommitted to the Committee on the Pott Of-
fice and Po-t Koads. with in>tru<'tions to inquire and report
whethei any ami what further legislation of a general char-
acter is required m lelauon to the transportation of the mail
by raiiroiuN and ctrnmboats."
Mr. JAMIESON moved to amend Mr. Rock-
well's amendment as follows:
Rc<oh<cd, That, by wav of amendment to the several piop-
ositioi)45 before trie committee, trie committee recommend to
fie [louse a recommumt nt ot the same to the Committee on
the Poi> Oltiee and Pn>t Una with m-^ti notions to repoit a
bill granting equal mail facilities throughout the Union.
Disa2reed to.
Mr. HALL, of Missouri, moved to amend Mr.
Rockwell's amendment, by adding after the word
steamboat" the words •' orhyany other mode."
Mr. ROCKWELL accepted Mr. Hall's amend-
ment as a modification.
Mr. McKAY moved to amend Mr. Rockwell's
amendment by adding the following :
" A'so, to ascertain the terms uponu Inch toe department
ra.i b^ r*-h;a?ed ft >'n the contract with the bay <-ompacy
for the tian-portation ot the mail; also, the term.- upon
which a contract can be made with the Frederick>bun? and
.1 Potomac Haiiro-id Company for the tiansportation oi said
luaii."'
Mr. ROCKWELL accepted Mr. McKay's
,i amendment as a modification.
The question was then taken on Mr. Rock-
: well's amendment, and decided in the negative—
. ayes 85, noes 92.
< "The committee then rose and reported*the joint
resolution as amended.
On motion, it was ordered that when this House
adjourns it will adjourn to Monday next.
And, on motion, the House adjourned.

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
Moxday, January 10, 1848.
The Journal of Fi iclay last was read and ap-
; proved.
THE SOUTHERN MAlX.
When the House adjourned on that day, the
: pending question was on agreeing to the amend-
ments reported hy the Committee of the Whole, to
: wif: the amendment of Mr. Joxes, of Tennessee,
and the amendment of Mr. Hall, of Missouri,
! as published with the proceedings of that day.
The question on agreeing to these amendments
coining up to-day—
■ Mr. GOGGkN moved to recommit the resolu-
i. tion and amendments with the following instruc-
/ ttons: " To report upon all the facts in relation to
the subieel-matter of the sexid resolution, with such
' iiiodiliuition or alteration of the same as may be
de^-ned exnclient.''
Air. GOGGiX remarked, in support of this
motion to recommit, that jthe Committee on the
Post Office and Post Roads had reported no facts
accompanying their resolution. In order to en-
' able them to do so, and to do justice to the original
!, mover of the resolution, he wished it recommit-
I; ted; and he hoped the question would be disposed
i' of without further delay.
!■ Mr. BR.ODHEAD said the gentleman from
i' Viiginia desired this bill to be lecoinmiited for the
; purpose of having the facts reported to the House,
i He thought the facts had been sufficiently aimed
to the House, as well by the Postmaster General
os bv those who had discussed the question here.
!j The gentleman desired to get rid of tins hill, ar,d,
fherelbie, he (AI>*. 13.) thought the best way to
' dispose of it would be to lay the whole subject on
the piide. He theielbie made that motion.
! The question hemg taken, it was decided in the
' negative: Yeas 69, nays 124.
The motion then lecurred on agreeing to the
motion to recommit with instructions, when—
! Air. JOIVES, of Tennessee, moved the previous
, question, which was seconded,and the main ques-
tion ordered to te now put,\iz: Will the House
' ULfree to the first amendment reported by the Com-
mittee of the Whole, (Air. Jones's
