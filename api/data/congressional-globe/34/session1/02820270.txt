of course, more frequently employed. Forty years
ago, when we had only about thirty captains, there
were more of them at sea than there are now. In
1818 there were as many as sixteen at sea. It is
a remarkable fact, that in 1819, and again in 1824,
every captain in the Navy was employed in some
duty; and from 1815 to 1825 there were not, at
any one time, as many as five unemployed. The
commanders, too, were nearly all kept on active
duty, either at #ea or on shore. But, in 1842, after
the increase in the number of captains and com-
manders, there were thirty-four of the former
unemployed, and fifty of the latter.
In the late report of the Naval Committee of the
Senate, quoting what they had said one or two j
years ago, they complain that, out of sixty-eight j
captains, forty-two were waiting orders at a sal- j
ary of $2,500 per annum, making an aggregate j
of $105,000; that out of ninety-eight commanders,
forty-two were waiting orders at$l,800 per annum
malting $76,000; and that of three hundred and I captains, and only one among the commanders

services of midshipmen. We must either go on
and authorize the Secretary of the Navy to make
further additions to the active-service list by the
appointmentof new midshipmen,—in which event
the expenses of the Navy will be very consider-
ably increased, and the amount necessary to be
applied to the building of ships will probably be
correspondingly diminished;—or we must restore
things to the position in which they were at the
passage of the law.
Now, suppose we allow things to remain as
they are—suppose we allow the officers to con-
tinue in the positions in which they have been
placed, will not the same complaints recur in a
few years from now, that we nave lately heard?
Will not the demand be made upon you to repeat
the same process you have lately gone through ?
Will you not hear the same cry of unsoundness
and reform? Why, unquestionably you will".
Last year there were but two deaths among the
twenty-six lieutenants, fifty-nine were waiting
orders at $1,200, 51aking $70,800.
Now, sir, this is quite an imposing array of
facts and figures; but Jet us see if this state of
things has been at all improved by the application
of tiie remedy recommended. We have now,
waiting orders or unemployed, thirty-seven cap-
tains on the active list, and thirty-one on the re-
served list, making in all sixty-eight; thirty-seven
commanders on the active list, and thirty-three on
the reserved list—in all, seventy; and thirty lieu- :
tenants on the active list, and sixty-four on the {
reserved list; in all ninety-four. Will that com-
mittee exult over this proof of the success of their :
remedy ? But how is it on the score of expense ?
Let us see if we pay a less sum now to unem- j
ployed men than formerly. These captains now
cost us $152,500, instead of f105,000 as before;
the commanders $115,200, instead of $76,000; and
the lieutenants about $83,000, instead of $70,800.
Some little deduction should indeed be made from
these sums for two captains and three lieutenants,
who, though put on the reserved list, are still
retained on duty. I think, sir, the committee :
have little reason to plume themselves eith# '
upon their economy or their administrative |
policy. |
Before I conclude, sir, I wish to call attention
to another extraordinary result of the doings of
this board. Theyhave with A-awn so many from
active service that nearly all the younger officers 1
of the Navy have been promoted. It will sur- :
prise gentlemen to learn that there are but sixteen j
midshipmen at sea, in all parts of the world.
There are twenty-six of our ships in commission,
on board of which there is not one solitary mid-
shipman. The law prohibits any increase in the j
number of officers; and the recent promotions of j
midshipmen have been so numerous that the Sec- j
retary has been obliged to do without the services
of this useful class of officers, as he has no au- |
thority to appoint new midshipmen in.their places.
Now, sir, we must have midshipmen; the service
requires them; and you must either go on and
authorize new appointments of midshipmen, con-
trary to the expressed determination of Congress
when this law was passed, or you must go back
and place things, as far ss possible, where they
were before. You cannot remain where you
are.
There are only eighteen masters in the Navy,
though the law authorizes sixty; and you can-
not get new masters until some of the graduates
of the Naval Academy are ready to be advanced
to that post. At the academy there are now
about thirty midshipmen, and about one hundred
and twenty-five acting midshipmen.
This is the position, sir, in which the board
has left the service and the country. Congress
contemplated no such result. The very provi-
sion in this law, that there should be no increase
in the whole number of officers, showed their ex-
pectation that there would probably be so small
a number withdrawn from active service as to
render it unnecessary to authorize new appoint-
ments of midshipmen; but, instead of that, up- '■
wards of two hundred officers have been with-
drawn, and upwards of three hundred promo-
tions have been made.
I repeat, then, we cannot remain where we
are The regular duties of the ships require the
At this rate promotion in the regular course of
things will be languid and slow. The young offi-
cers, after the lapse of a few years, will have the
same appetite for advanced rank which same of
them seem to have had for some time past. If
you reject their demands—if the process we
have lately tried is not to be repeated, then it
will seem that it was not required by any public
necessity, but was only a swieroe for promoting
private and selfish interests, and giving advance-
ment to some impatient junior officers, at the
expense of their seniors. If, however, it is to be
continued and repeated at regular intervals, as a
wise public policy, and as part of a system of
naval discipline, then your reserved list will soon
outnumber your active-service list. This must
be the result if the reserved list is to be continu-
' ally recruited from the active-service list, while
that list cannot receive new additions to make up
for these losses.
Mr. Speaker, I have said that I voted for this
law; butl would not have done so if I had dreamed
that it would have been made to accomplish re-
sults, which I had foreseen as the unavoidable
consequences of other schemes that I had earn-
estly opposed. While, under the decisions of this
board, unworthy and incompetent men have
doubtless been dismissed or withdrawn, and
while, perhaps, others might properly have come
: under tneir notice who may have been overlooked
or undisturbed, I cannot doubt that many also
have been condemned whose capacity, ability,
gallantry, and accomplished personal and pro-
fessional character would illustrate the Navy of
any country. It may not be now possible to
repair all the mischief that this unhappy measure
has brought upon the service, in exciting bitter
recrimination, infusing distrust, stimulating jeal-
ousies, encouraging a mean selfishness, de-
stroying ancient friendships, and provoking fierce
animosities; but we may yet do much; and let us,
before the opportunity shall wholly pass away—
j let us do all we can.

SPEECH OF HON. JAMES HARLAN,
op iowa,
Ik the Senate, March 27,1856.
The Senate, as in Committee of the Whole, having
under consideration the Bill to authorize the people of
Kansas to form a constitution and State government pre-
paratory to their admission into the Union,
Mr. HARLAN said:
Mr. President: I engage in the discussion of
the general subject, which, it seems to me, lies at
the foundation of the varying opinions on Kan-
sas affairs which have been expressed hitherto
by other Senators on the floor of the Senate, with
reluctance and embarrassment. The relation I
sustain to this body, the most august on earth, is
a new one—the subject is one of overwhelming
! magnitude—and 1 am surrounded by a disap-
pointed Senate and a crowded gallery, who have
been convened,by his high reputation for ability,
to listen to the honorable Senator from Vermont,
[Mr. Collamer,] in reply to the honorable Sen-
ator from Illinois, [Mr. Dowlas.] But, sir, I
this union of States. The highest officer known
to the Constitution seems to entertain no such
fears. Early in the session, and in advance of
the organization of the House .of Representatives,
two voluminous State papers were laid before
Congress and the country by the Chief Magis-
trate of the nation, in which this question is
elaborately discussed: Historically—commencing
with the origin of the Government, and proceed-
ing, through all its varying vicissitudes, up to the
-date.of these messages: Judicially—portraying the
constitutional relations of slavery to freedom, of
the slave States to the; free States in the Federal
Union, and of all the States to the common Ter-
ritories: Politically—placing his friends all on the
side of justice and law, of the Constitution and of
the Union; and his political opponents all in the
torong-, in company with those who are said to be
plotting treason against the Government under which
they Iwe. Since which a third message, in obedi-
ence to a resolution of this body, and numerous
official papers from Kansas, out of which the
opinions of the President and his friends have
probably been, in part, formed, have been sent to
the Senate, eliciting the warm approval of those
who undertake to speak for him on this floor.

shall never, probably, be less m the way thap on J favored with a very voluminous report from the
the present occasion.
Before, however, proceeding to this debate, it
is no more than just to myself that I should say
that, although so long the theme of earnest dis-
cussion t  and ovt of Congress, I have never
hitherto attempted or desired to make a speech on
the perplexing subject of African slavery as it
exists in the United States. I had supposed its
diseussion useless, mischievous, and even dan-
gerous, to the perpetuity of the Union.
But, sitting here in this Chamber, I find there
are those who do not regard the discussion of
this subject as dangerous to the continuance of ,
Committee on Territories, followed «y a long and
labored speech of its chairman, the honorable
Senator from Illinois, [Mr. Douglas,] sustaining
the opinions of the President.
Congress may not Bow, therefore, avoid the
discassion of this subject without a manifestation
of great disrespect for the Chief Magistrate of the
nation, and his friends and supporters.
But in casting aside my previous prejudices
against *' agitation," and in following the Pres-
ident through these elaborate State papers, I find
their whole tenor and spirit at war with the
impressions made «n my mind by my previous
