It has been reported by several deserters that an attempt was to have been made last night by the enemy to cut their way out; that the signals were given, but the men failed to respond.

The general commanding directs that the utmost vigilance be exercised by the troops along our front to prevent the enemy succeeding, should they contemplate a like attempt to-night.

GENERAL: I have directed the Sixty-THIRD Illinois and four companies of the Eighty-seventh to report to you t-night. Instruct General Leggett to move with his brigade toward Sulphur Springs, on the Benton road, at 11. 30 to-night. He can march his command 6 or 8 miles, and halt them in a good position for the night, and then march early in the morning until he reaches the position, where he will report in person, for orders, to Brigadier-General McArthur. Major-General Grant informs me that a deserter states that the rebels will make an attempt to cut their way out to-night. You will instruct your pickets to be particularly vigilant, and have your command posted so as to best resist any attempt of this kind, and at the same time prevent our men from falling into confusion. Instruct the brigade and regimental command-
