Congiess Immed ately aftei the close of the last
session, the bank, tluough its president, an
nounced its ability and rradiness to abandon the
sys+en of unpai Ulelcd curtailment, and the inter
ruption of domestic exchanges, which it had piac-
ticed upon fiom the 1st of August, lb33, to the
30th of June, 1834, and to extend its accommoda
tions to the community The grounds assumed
m this annunciation amounted to an acknowledg-
ment that the cuitaihntnt, in the extent to vvnich
it had been carried, was not necessary to the
safety of the bank, and had been persisted in
inertly to induce Congiess to giant the prayei of
thp bank m its momonal relative to the removal
of the deposits, and o give it a new ch"iter
They wcie substantially a confession that a'l the

of congratulation tl at Congiess and the countiy

that the cntigits. of our people soon found relief
from this wanton tyranny, in vast impoitation 
of the piccious meta s fiom almost every pait of
thcwoild, and thatatth c'o e of this tremendous
eífoi t to contiol oui Government, the bank found
itself pow lless, and no longi i vblc to loan out its
suiplus means The community has lea ned to
manage its affairs w ithout its assistance, and trade
had already found new auxiliaries so that on the
1st of Oetobei last the extraordinai y spectacle was
presented of a national bank, more than one half
of whose capital v as either lying unpioductivc
in its vaults, oi m the hands of foieiffn bankeis
To the needless d stresses biought on the

since been added the open si izuic of he dividends

constitutional piovmon the claim of the bank can

Congress But the bank has n vei asked for an
appiopnation It attempts to defeat the provision
of the Constitution, and obtain payment without

propnation passed by both Houses, and appioved
. by the Piesident, it makes an appropnation for
itself, and invites an appeal to the judiciary to

money without authority of law, before it is
placed to the ciedit of the Tieasuiei, as to take it
fiom the Treasury In the annual repoit of the
Secretaiy of the Treasury, and in his coirespond-
ence with the president of the bank, and the
opinions of the Attorney Geneial accompanying
it, you will find a fuither examination of the
claims of the bank, and the course it has pui sued
It seems due to the safety of the public funds
remaining in the bank, and to the honor of the
American people, that measuies be taken to sep
aiatt the Government entnely fiom an institution
so mischievous to the public piospenty, and so
regardless of the Constitution and la-vs By tnns

deride the public authonty in othei iespects,and
to bung it into disrepute at home and abioad,

overoalance all it-, am uitiBeS      The bold effoit
the present bank has made to control the Gov-
ernment, the distresses it has wantonly produced,
the violence of which it has been the occasion in
one of oui cities famed for its observance of law
and order, are butpiemonitions of the fate which
awaits the American people should they be de-
luded into a peipetuation of this institution, or
the establishment of another like it It is fer-
vently hoped that, thus admonished, those who
have heretofore favored the establishment of a
substitute for the present bank, will be induced to
abandon it, as it is evidently better to incur any
inconvenience that may be reasonably expected,
than to concentiate the whole moneyed powei of
the Republic m any form whatsoever, or under
any restnctions
Happily it is aheady illustrated that the agency
of such an institution is not necessary to the fiscaj
opeiations of the Government The State banks
are found fully adequate to the performance of all
services which were rcquned of the Bank of the
United States, quite as piomptly, and with the
same cheapness They have maintained them-
selves, and discharged all these duties, while the
Bank of the United States was still powei ful, and
m the field as an open enemy, and it is not possi-
ble to conceive that tl ey will find greatei difficul-
ties in their opeiations when that enemy shall
cease to exist
The attention of Congiess is earnestly invited
to the leguHtion of the deposits in the State
banks by law Although the powei now exer
ciscd by the executive department in this behalf
is only such as was uniformly excited through
every «Vdmnnstration, fiom the oiigm of the Gov-
ernment up to the establishment of the piesent
bank, yet it is one which is susceptible of regu-
lation by law, and, theiefore, ought so to be
regulated The powei of Congiess to dnect in
what places the Tieasurei shall keep the moneys
in the Treasuiy, and to impose restnctions upon
the executive authonty m relation to their cus
tody and removal, is unlimited, and its exercise
w ill lathei be com ted than discouraged by those
puolic ofliceis and agents on whom rests the
responsibility foi their safety Itisdesiiable that
as little powei as possible should be left to the
President oi Secretary of the Treasury over those
institutions, which, being thus need fiom exec-
utive influence, and without a common head to
dnect their operations, would have neither the
temptation noi the ability to interfere ill the polit-
ical <onflicts of the country Not denvmg their
ch u teis fi om the national authonties, they would
nevei have those inducements to meddle in gen-
eral elections which have led the Bank of the
United States to agitate and convulse the country
foi upwards of two years
The pi ogress of our gold coinage is creditable
to the ofliceis of the Mint, and promises in a
short penod to furnish the countiy with a sound
and poit iblt cunencv, which will much diminish
the inconvenience to travelers of the want of a
geneial paper cuirency, should the State banks
bt incapable of furnishing it Those institutions
haie iheady shown themselves competent to
pui chase and furnish domestic exchange for the
convenience of tiade at reasonable lates and not
a doubt is entertained that, in a short period, all
the wvntsof the countiy in bank accommoda-
tions and exchange will bo supplied as promptly
and chtapl) as they have heietofore been by the
Bank of the United States If the several States
shall be induced gradually to leform their bank
nig systems, and prohibit the issue of all small
notes, we shall, in a few yiais, have a currency
as sound, and as little liable to fluctuations, as
any othtr commeicial countiy
