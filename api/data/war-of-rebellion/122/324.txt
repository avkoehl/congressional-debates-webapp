In the name of our people I now address this appeal to you. Mr. Harrison, who will hand you this, and who is a member of our "executive council," will explain to you fully our situation.

Very respectfully,

JNO. S. CARLILE.

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,

July 8, 1861.

Honorable SIMON CAMERON,

Secretary of War:

SIR: Various complaints have come to me relative to the difficulties of our citizens retaining their slaves at home in consequence of the tempting offers made to them by some of the volunteer regiments. I know that it is not the desire of the Government to encourage the escape of this species of property from the lawful owner, and I would therefore most respectfully ask the Department to issue an order to the commander of the Maryland Division to exclude from all the camps in his division such slaves as may be found therein at this time, and hereafter to permit none to enter their camps. If such an order was published at this time and enforced, it would at once calm down the public mind and prevent a great deal of bad feeling which is being engendered by the course at present pursued.

With great respect, your obedient servant,

CHAS. B. CALVERT.
HEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY,Washington, July 8, 1861.

Henceforward the telegraph will convey no dispatches concerning the operations of the Army not permitted by the Commanding General.

WINFIELD SCOTT.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

The above order is confirmed.

SIMON CAMERON,

Secretary of War.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Governor SAMUEL J. KIRKWOOD,

Des Moines, Iowa:

SIR: You will consider this letter an official order to equip and have mustered into service of the United States the regiment of cavalry already accepted from your State, commanded by Colonel Fitz Henry Warren.

Respectfully,

SIMON CAMERON,

Secretary of War.
