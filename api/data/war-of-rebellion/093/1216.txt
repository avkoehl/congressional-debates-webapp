HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE WEST,Tuscumbia, Ala., November 17, 1864.

General J. B. HOOD,

Commanding, &amp; c.:

GENERAL: General Beauregard instructs me to say that a bridge about three miles from Tuscumbia, on road to Cherokee, is now being constructed, and that, for want of workmen, it cannot be completed in less than five or six days, and that at this point the road is almost impassable. There are also other points on the road which will become impassable should the rain continue. He thinks it important that a proper force should be sent to complete the improvement as early as possible.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEORGE WM. BRENT,

Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General.

Commanding, & c.:

GENERAL: The following just received from Major General Howell Cobb, and is communicated for your information:

GRIFFIN, GA., [November 15,] 1864.

(Via Macon 16th.)

General G. T. BEAUREGARD:

The enemy has burnt Atlanta and destroyed railroad to Allatoona, burning bridge over Chattahoochee. He moved out of Atlanta with a very large force in direction of Macon by Jonesborough and McDonough. We have no force to oppose him and must fall back to Macon, where re-enforcements should be sent at once to meet him successfully.

HOWELL COBB,

Major-General, Commanding.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEORGE WM. BRENT,

Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General.

In consequence of General Cobb's and Wheeler's telegrams of 16th, I advise sending them immediately whole of Jackson's division, if it can be done without endangering success of your operations.
