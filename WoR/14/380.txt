
all telegraphic messages were required to be shown to the President and Secretary of War.

You also asked certain changes of officers, which I could not possibly make. Again, at Cherrystone you thought I left the office without hearing. I supposed I had received two messages from that place and wrote an answer; being completely worn-out I retired, directing any other messages to be kept till I could get some rest. I afterward learned, to my regret, that both of those which had been deciphered were written before you came to Cherrystone. I deeply regretted the mistake, but it was too late to remedy it. I had slept but a few hours for the last three or four nights, and, like the operator who attempted to decipher your messages, I was only half awake at the time.

My dear general, we must not let little things annoy us, but push right ahead to the great end in view.

There is enough and more than enough for all of us to do, although none of us can do exactly what we could wish. That Lee is moving on Pope with his main army I have no doubt. Unless we can unite most of your army with Burnside and Pope, Washington is in great danger. Under these circumstances you must pardon the extreme anxiety [and perhaps a little impatience] which I feel. Every moment seems to me as important as an ordinary hour.

Yours, in haste,

H. W. HALLECK.

As a temporary measure, please place one of your field batteries in the work at Gloucester Point.

Please push the work laid out by the engineer officers with the utmost rapidity. I hope to have new troops to relieve your men by the time transports are ready for your corps. Please detail some of your artillery
