HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES, May 6, 1864-11.45 a.m.

Major-General BURNSIDE:

Push in with all vigor so as to drive the enemy from General Hancock's front, and get in on the Orange and Fredericksburg plank road at the earliest possible moment. Hancock has been expecting you for the last three hours, and has been making his attack and dispositions with a view to your assistance.

By command of Lieutenant-General Grant:

JNO. A. RAWLINS,Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff.

GENERAL BURNSIDE'S HEADQUARTERS, May 6, 1864-12.30 p.m.

(Received 2 p.m.)

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Burnside put in one brigade behind another, holding the third in reserve. The leading brigade was been rather smartly engaged for fifteen minutes and the firing has now stopped. He must be near Hancock, as General Stevenson, who got cut off from Hancock with 100 men, came into Burnside's column.

C. B. COMSTOCK,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Aide-de-Camp.

GENERAL BURNSIDE'S HEADQUARTERS, May 6, 1864-1.55 p.m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

As Willcox's brigade is withdrawn from its position, about 2 miles out the Parker Store road, General Willcox report the enemy following it with skirmishers, but apparently not in great force. There are no troops now on the road except those about half a mile from the Lacy house.

C. B. COMSTOCK,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Aide-de-Camp.

Burnside is driving the enemy in his front, and has carried a small earth-works or log-work.

GENERAL BURNSIDE'S HEADQUARTERS, May 6, 1864-2.45 p.m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Warren's troops, now on the Parker's Store road, one-half or three-quarters of a mile from the Lacy house, don't connect with Wadsworth's right, and Burnside's whole force is three-quarters of a mile in front of the gap. Connection should be made. Potter, commanding leading division, reports enemy advancing at 2.25. Willcox is moving his brigade up to him. Some regiment had behaved badly, and Potter had been checked.

C. B. COMSTOCK,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Aide-de-Camp.

An officer who came in the Parker's Store road with Willcox's brigade reports seeing a force which he thought as large as a division moving from our left to right.
