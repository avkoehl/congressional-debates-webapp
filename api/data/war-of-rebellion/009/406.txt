Major General GEORGE B. McCLELLAN:

GENERAL: I embarked 7,000 infantry and was on my way to join you, at the suggestion of the Secretary of War, when I met a messenger, informing me of your important success before Richmond, which, if true, rendered it unnecessary for me to join you. I accordingly brought my fleet to an anchor, and have sent a steamer through to Norfolk to ascertain the exact state of affairs, and shall hold myself in readiness to move in any direction.

The movement up the country in the direction of Goldsborough will be pushed as rapidly as possible. The railroad bridges and culverts, as you know, are all destroyed, but we are rapidly repairing them, and to-morrow we will make an advance of some 10 or 12 miles beyond our present outposts. I had already commenced a movement with my entire force, when I received a dispatch from the President and Secretary of War requesting me to do anything in my power to assist you before Richmond.

I have the honor to be, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.
