Mr. JOHNSTON. I present the memorial
of David Fultz, of the town of Staunton, Vir-
ginia, who represents that he was the owner
of a large farm near that town, and that Fed-
eral soldiers under the command of Generals
Hunter and Sheridan, when they passed through
the valley, took and carried away from him
nine valuable horses, all of his grain and pro-
visions, and entered his dwelling and broke and
destroyed and carried away many articles of
property and some family relics of great value,
leaving him withoat the necessaries of life. He
also teets forth that he iwver, by word, act, or
deed, aided or abetted the rebellion, bnt, on
the other hand, he had uniformly denounced
secession as an abominable political heresy and
rebellion as the madness of folly and wicked-
ness. He therefore prays, that being a loyal
man and a friend to the Union, he may be speed-
ily compensated lor the actual losses sustained
by him. I know him personally as a man of
high standing and good character, Mid 1 hope
the prayer of the petitioner will receive the
favorable attention of the Committee on Claims,
