COLONEL: Your dispatch from Varnell's at 8.45 a. m. is received. The commanding general desires, if the enemy appears in too large force in your front and you have to retire, that you move either toward this place or Ellildge's Mill, as you may deem safer, so as not to expose your flank.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Colonel J. B. DORR,Commanding Cavalry Brigade, Varnell's Station:

Your dispatch is received. General Howard has taken Tunnel Hill without much opposite. I think the cavalry force in your front cannot be large. I propose to remain here for the present. All I desire is that you cover my left flank, and inform me of any movement of the enemy in that directional. According to the general plan the cavalry is not to do any unnecessary fighting. There is a road leading toward Dalton form Ellidge's Mill, and passing between this place and Varnell's Station. That road should be held. It covers the road from this place to Varnell's, at Kincannon's farm. According to my best map that crossing is the best place for your main force. Please examine and inform me.

Respectfully,

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.
