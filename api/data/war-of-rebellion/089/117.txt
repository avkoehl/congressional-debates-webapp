Major-General WEITZEL,

Commanding Eighteenth Corps:

GENERAL: I wish you could give me specific instructions what I shall do in case the enemy at any time attempt to move by my front to turn my left. I think they can do this if they only knew it. My line is too weak to be stretched over more ground.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. J. PAINE,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
