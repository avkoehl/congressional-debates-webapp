HEADQUARTERS SECOND CORPS,May 23, 1864.

General BIRNEY:

If possible keep your troops out of sight until we can develop what the enemy is doing. A rebel column is seen passing down on that other side. (Colonel Morgan says he has seen several thousand.) Colonel Tidball is looking for places to plant batteries, and Colonel M. says that best place in on the left, near the river road. There can be no reason, however, why we may not hold the river bank as well as the enemy. You will soon know what is possible. If you can's cross the river bank as well as the enemy. You will soon know what is possible. If you can's cross the river we will wait for orders.

Your obedient servant,

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS THIRD DIVISION,May 23, 1864-3.33 p. m.

Major-General HANCOCK:

GENERAL: The First Brigade has crossed the creek, not river. The river is some 500 yards farther, and behind it they have strong earth-works. They are certainly moving troops by brigades in full sight. The small earth-work near the creek can be taken. Our artillery does not open co-operate.

D. B. BIRNEY,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,May 23, 1864-4.10 p. m.

Major-General BIRNEY:

SIR: The major-general commanding directs me to say that he has directed Colonel Tidball to open as soon as possible. General Warren writes two hours ago that he has crossed above by fording. Whether it is the creek or the river, the major-general commanding does not know.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

FRANCIS A. WALKER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

TELEGRAPH ROAD SIGNAL STATION,
