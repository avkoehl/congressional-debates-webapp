RICHMOND, VA., June 14, 1862.

General BRAXTON BRAGG, Tupelo, Miss.:

You will immediately proceed to Jackson, Miss., and temporarily assume command of the department now commanded by General Lovell. After General Magruder joins, your further service there may be dispensed with. The necessity is urgent and absolute.

JEFFERSON DAVIS.

TUPELO, MISS., June 14, 1862.

(Received at Richmond, Va. June 15, 1862.)

General S. COOPER:

General Bragg has just communicated to me a telegram sending him to relieve temporarily General Lovell. His presence here I consider indispensable at this moment, especially as I am leaving for a while on surgeon's certificate. For four months I have delayed obeying their urgent recommendation in that respect. I desire to be back here in that respect. I desire to be back here in time to take the offensive as soon as our forces shall have been sufficiently organized. I must have a short rest.

G. T. BEAUREGARD.
