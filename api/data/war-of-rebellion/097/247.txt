MARCH 29, 1865-5.30 p. m.

Captain DAVIS,

Chief Signal Officer, Headquarters Army of the Potomac:

Working parties along enemy's lines have retired. The party reported at work on new line, with the exception of about 200 at work on small fort to our left of the line, have struck their tents that were in rear of that line and moved toward the city on Boydton road. No further change observed. I should think there were about 2,500 cavalry and about 4,000 infantry passed to our left in the columns previously reported.

Lieutenant, Signal Corps, U. S. Army.

(Same to Major Paine, headquarters Ninth Army Corps; Captain Norton, General Ord's headquarters.)
