How many men and how many horses will there be in the Fifth Massachusetts Cavalry to send?

Major General C. C. AUGUR:

The Fifth Massachusetts Cavalry will have 1,200 men and 900 horses, camp and garrison equipage, and six wagons. They had better turn over their muskets here, probably. There are about fifty men in the hospital fit for duty in the First Battalion, Veteran Reserve Corps, and thirty for duty in the First of those the board were permitted to have access to. Doctor Delany returns to Washington to-night, and will report the state of things there. I shall have over 1,000 men, including the detachments. I will mange to get along until the Veteran Reserves are filled up. I am informed that the Eleventh Regiment will be filled very soon.
