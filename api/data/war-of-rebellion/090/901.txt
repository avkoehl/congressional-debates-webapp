HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY BRIGADE,Near Fort Buffalo, Va., August 24, 1864-9 a.m.

Lieutenant Colonel J. H. TAYLOR,

Chief of Staff and Assistant Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: I have the honor to inform you that a dispatch has just been received from the officer commanding at Annadale. He stores that Mosby attacked and drove in the pickets on the Faifax Court-House road this morning about 5 o'clock. Afterward attacked the stockade, shelled it awhile, ordered it three times to surrender, and finding it would not, withdrew and gave up the attack, probably with an intention to threaten some other part of our picket-line. On learning of the attack every available man was sent out from here to give relief. Mosby had with him two pieces of artillery and with a force variously estimated at from less than 200 to 300, and even 500, men. No damage, was done by him, except the wounding of one horse. The firing lasted about three-quarters of an hour, and the cannon were placed not over 300 or 400 yards from the stockade. The morning was exceedingly foggy and what execution was done by our men is not known.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. M. LAZELLE,

Colonel Sixteenth New York Cavalry, Comdg. Cavalry Brigade.

Lieutenant Colonel J. H. TAYLOR,

Chief of Staff and Assistant Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: I have the honor to report that no information has been received from Colonel Gansevoort. A picket-post, consisting of one corporal and three men, was picked up by Mosby this morning near Annandale. He was followed with all available mounted men to Germantown this morning as soon as a force could be sent from here. He was reported by citizens to have in reserve in that vicinity two additional pieces of artillery in position, and a considerable party with them. His whole strength was about 250 men. He had evidently been misinformed of the strength of the force at Annandale, and supposed it much less.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. M. LAZELLE,

Colonel Sixteenth New York Cavalry, Comdg. Cavalry Brigade.
