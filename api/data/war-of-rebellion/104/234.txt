HDQRS. ARMY AND DIVISION OF WEST MISSISSIPPI,Near Spanish Fort, Ala., April 4, 1865.

Major General F. STEELE:

Generals Granger and Smith were instructed this evening, in case you should be attacked, to leave here only one line of investing troops, and to re-enforce you with the reserves of the two corps. From the best and reliable information the rebel force at Mobile is not equal to the number of troops now under your command, and it would be sheer desperation on the enemy's part to attack you. If they should, however, do it, you may rely on the promptest succor by way of Bay Minette bridge.

P. J. OSTERHAUS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS OF GENERAL STEELE,April 4, 1865-7 p.m.

Commanding Army and Division of West Mississippi:

Your dispatch of this date respecting re-enforcements received, and instructions imparted to division commanders.

Very respectfully,

F. STEELE,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS U. S. FORCES,In Front of Blakely, April 4, 1865-11.20 p.m.

Major General P. J. OSTERHAUS,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: Your dispatch just received. We feel confident of being able to repel any attack from the enemy. The dispatch in regard to the arrival of these re-enforcements was sent merely as information. Captain Burnham reports the enemy's line much longer than we supposed. He thinks we have not troops enough to make a complete investment. I shall reconnoiter with General Garrard in the morning and ascertain whether our present line, if extended, would be enfiladed from the lunette or the gun-boats. If so, it might be best to terminate our line by picketing across to Bay Minette for the present.

F. STEELE,

Major-General.

SIGNAL STATION, April 4, 1865.

Respectfully, &amp;c.,

RICHARD P. STRONG,

First Lieutenant and Signal Officer, U. S. Army.
