Total $89,450,000
Of this amount $81,000,000 were yielded by the mines
on the Comstoek lodo alone.
The bullion of these mines consists of a mixture
of gold and silver, and the ratio of the vnluo of the
two metals is shown by a table compiled from the
assays made at the Silver State Reduction Works
in 1863 and 1864, is, gold 318-10 per cent.; silver,
65 3-10 per cent.
Assuming the same ratio for total bullion pro-
duct of the State, the quantity of silver produced in
Nevada from 1859 to 1867, inclusive, ^mounts to
$53,410,850. For California, Idaho, Colorado, Ore-
gon, and New Mexico, no exact statistics of silver
production appear to have been kept. From the
Lako Superior mines the following amounts were
deposited in tho United States Mint and branches

The Tariff'.
SPEECH OP HON. EUGENE M. WILSON,
OF MINNESOTA,
In the House oi- Representatives,
March 29, 1870.
Tho House being in the Committer! of the Whole,
and having under consideration the bill (II. R. No.
1008) to amend existing laws relating to the duty on
imports, and for other purposes-
Mr. WILSON, of Minnesota, said:
Mr. Chairman : I desire to discuss this bill
in regard to its failure to relieve the people at
a time when relief is especially needed. All
circumstances combine to render relief practi-
cable exeepttheunwillingness of certain classes
to relinquish a system of inordinate gains. For
eight years the grievous and increasing burdens
imposed by the high-tariff policy have been
borne with but little complaint. The people
received the plea of the necessities of war and
suffered in silence. Since the close of the
conflict they have accepted the statement of
the requirements of the public debt aud said
but little. But patience has ceased to be a
virtue, and they now demand a reduction of
their taxes. They will no longer be put off by
the never-kept promises of the party in power,
but require action and at once. National feel-
ing is stirred to its depths, and all oyer the
land are calm men thinking this question for
themselves instead of trusting the deceptive
assertions of party leaders that all will be made
right in due time. It is then our immediate
duty to inquire what reduction can be made
Bureau of Statistics, March 9, 1870.
and in what manner it can be made of the
most benefit to the people.
the different classes on reduction op taxes.
We find upon this question three classes:
the President and his peculiar adherents, who
desire no material reduction of taxes, but who
would use all surplus to create a sinking fund;
the protectionists, who are willing and anxious
to reduce internal revenue and income taxes;
and the anti-protectionists, who would reduce
as much as the necessities of an economically
administered Government will bear, and make
tho reduction principally in the tariff duties.
The Executive party is too small to need
further consideration.
Tho protectionists desire the reduction of
internal revenue and income taxes, from 110
desire to help the people, but merely to create
a necessity tn maintain the present enormous
tariff rates. Tho income tax is one of the least
objectionable of taxes, because it falls en-
tirely upon the wealthy. It is paid by some
250,000 persons, all told, and never readies
the cabins of the poor. To the extent we
reduce this we must retain the increased price
of all dutiable articles that enter into the eon-
sumption of every-day life. When wo remove
the y 31,000,000 of income tax we help the rich
alone. But when we take that amount from
the tariff duties we relieve the rich and poor
alike. Many of the largest of the taxable in-
comes have been created by the tribute which
the whole people have been compelled to pay
by this protective system, and it is but just
that some of it should come back.
The anti-protectionists desire the reduction
to be made in tariff duties, because by so doing
they not only relieve the people of the amount
actually paid into the Treasury, but of at least
three times as much paid our manufacturers in
the increased price of their products.
A REDUCTION CAN BE MADE.
Can a reduction be made ? Does the Gov-
ernment need all the revenue now being raised?
At the end of the last fiscal year there was a
surplus of near $100,000,000. The increase
of revonue received this year over last will be
at least $35,000,000. We will be saved a num-
ber of millions in the matter of paying bounties.
The bonds purchased will save us §0,000,000
of interest. We have no new $7,000,000 cull
for Alaska projects, unless the Senate should,
as is not probable, be beguiled to aid the
Presideut and his lobby in their curious and
doubtful course after San Domingo. The pro-
posed reduction of the Army bill should save
several millions. There must, then, be a sur-
plus of $150,000,000, unless the Administra-
tion is woefully extravagant. Shall we continue
raising this surplus, or shall we lessen it by
reducing tho taxes ? Whut necessity for it ?
There is no anticipated war ; there is no due
debt pressing for payment. The bondholders,
exempt from taxation, do not desire payment.
The Secretary of the Treasury claims lie can
exchange them for 4, 4 J, and 5 per cents. That
is less interest than any private individual can
borrow at, and we of the far West, who have to
pay twelve per cent, for our private debts, prefer
to let our portion of the public liability run for
awhile at four or fivo.
Whence, then, comes this persistent cry for
a large sinking fund, for a rapid extinction ot"
the public debt? It is from those interested
in that peculiar system of revenue most bur-
densome to the poople and most advantageous
to the monopolists; that system compelling
the consumer of manufactured articles to pay
largely increased prices, of which increase but
one fourth reaches the public Treasury; that
system which under the present tariff compels
tho payment of duties running from GO to 300
per cent, upon the ordinary necessities of life,
all of which duty must in the end bo paid by
the consumers.
the claim that protection reduces pbick8.
Protectionists, it is true, have the audacity
to claim that prices have lowered under the
influence of a high-tariff tystem; but they for-
get to tell that gold has run down from 250 to
111; they forget to tell you how much lower
still prices have been reduced in other coun-
tries. They exhibit a list of prices 20 or ;J0
years ago, and because improvements in ma-
chinery, increased skill of operatives, and
greater production of raw material have kept
pace with tho civilization of the world, and
lowered the price of production, they cry, "Be-
hold the beneficent results of a high tariff! "
Because lumber can be made cheaper with
gang and circular saws than under their grand-
fathers' system of saw-pit and cross-cut, they
would have you believe the reduction thocffcot
of high duties. Because the farmer can har-
vest and thresh cheaper with reaper and header
and horse-power threshing-machine than under
the ancient plan of sickle and flail, they would
give all tho glory to the protective system.
Upon some such basis they are asking higher
duties, reasoning, 110 doubt, that if a tarifl
averaging 47 per cent, lowers prices, one twice
as great will lower them twice as much. Their
argumentative process is similar to that of our
Emerald friend, who, to the boisterous peddler
proclaiming that his patent stove would save
half the wood, proposed to buy two and save it
all. Perhaps, by continuing this duty-raising
process indefinitely, they may in time be en-
abled to make presents of their goods.
No, Mr. Chairman, this claim of reduced
prices is too absurd to deserve serious argument.
Its daily refutation is hadin every dutiable arti-
