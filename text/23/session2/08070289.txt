Ib35.                                THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.                                   2g 
he would seem to suggest.    A difficulty was pre-
sented fiom the situation of the public grounds
It would require time to investigate how many lots
could be spared from the uses or probable calls of
the Government
Mr. BENTON was aware that his suggestion
would defeat the bill, and his object in making it
was to gam time to make the necessary investiga-
tion. He therefore moved the necessary amend-
ments to the bill, so as to make the appropriation
to each of the cities for one year only
After some conversation between Messrs TY-
LER, BENTON, and SOUTHARD, the amend-
ment was agreed to
The question being on the engrossment of the
bill,
Mr. CLAY said, he should vote for it in its pre-
sent shape, for the purpose of relieving the press-
ing necessities of this city, but he hoped at another
session that the Committee on the District would
introduce a bill to take the stock of the canal, and
assume the whole foreign debt That he believed
to be the only essential relief we could extend to
them
Mr PRESTON expressed his intention to vote
for the bill, but he did so only from dire necessity
He would vote for it only to prevent the city of
Washington from be.ig " sold to the Dutch."
Mr CALHOUN sincerely felt for the situation
in which the city was placed, but he could undei-
stand this bill as nothing more or less than a prop-
osition to make a donation of so much of the peo-
ple's money to them He really commiserated
their unfortunate situation, but he thought we had
no right to give the property of the people away
as was proposed This bill was setting a bad pre-
cedent These people must suffer, and to relieve
them now, would only be an inducement to them
to incur greater debts, in the belief that Congress
would always assist them. He recommended them
as a friend to depend upon their own resources
and industry, which alone could give them lasting
relief.
Mr BUCHANAN said, when this bill first
came up, he thought he had determined to vote
against it, and he certainly should have done so,
if it had no\ been for the change'which had been
made in it, upon the motion oí the honorable gen
tleman from Missouri But now he felt that he
was, in some measure, under duress with regard
to it, and could not vote against it He diffeied,
however, from the gentleman from Virginia, [Mr
Leigh,] that the law which authorized this debt
to be incurred, could be construed into a guarantee
on the part of the Government to pay the debt He
decjmed entering into that question now But the
President of the United States was made the
executor of the law, and if this bill did not pass,
it would be the President's duty to sell thi  city
He would vote for the bill for once, but, with the
gentleman from South Carolina, [Mr Cílhoon,]
he would advise the people of this city to depend
upon their own energies and industry for substan-
tial relief, and cease their applications to Con-
gress.
Mr TYLER said he was very sorry the gentle-
man from Pennsylvania could not vote foi further
relief than by giving his support to this bill Tor,
to be candid on the subject, if the relief is not to
be cortmued, this appropriation will be of no man-
ner of use whatever The truth is, the energies
of these people are entirely crippled, and their
means and strength prostrated in the dust He
hoped, at the next session, the honorable gentle-
man would open his heart and be willing to grant
peimanent relief
Mr KING, of Georgia, said that he too wished
to give in his experience on the subject of this bill
With him the conflict between inclination and
duty had been a most painful one And like some
others, he had made up his mind to vote for the
bill with the greatest reluctance He had been
surprised by a reference to the act authorizing the
loan to find that, as between the Government and
the contractors of the loan, Congress nad virtually
guarant ed the debt The nonor of the nation then
was pledged for the payment of the debt And
on a hasty mqun y into the affairs of ihese three
cities, he did not believe it m then power, at pres-
ent, to discharge the debt And like othert,, he
had no idea of seeing the capital of the Union in
the hands of the Dutch
Some gentlemen had constitutional scruples on
the subject It was thought we had no power to
make a gratuity to the people of the District. He
did not feel these scruples, though he had not
given a studied examination to the subject. He
was, he thought, generally as much in favor of a
strict construction of the Constitution as any other
Senator, but, as at present impressed, he thought
that whatever restrictions were placed upon us
when legislating for the States, there was no re-
striction upon our sovereignty here But power,
and the propriety of its exercise, were different
questions. We might possess the power and
refuse to exercise it, on the score of justice and
expediency, and here, he thought, was the difficulty
in the measure before the Senate For if there was
any theory in which we all agreed, it was that re-
publican Government is,or ought to be, an associa-
tion upon principles of equality. What claims,
then, have the people of this city, as a part of the
great American family, to a gratuity from this
Government, more than Charleston, or any other
city in the Union' They had a claim to our
legislation for the usual purposes of Government,
to directand concentrate the energies of the people
to the greatest advantage, but they had no exclu-
sive claims to our bounty, at the expense of the
rest of the Union
With these views it would be seen with what
reluctance he voted for the bill, and he wished it
further understood that he did not stand pledged
to go further at the next session, if, in the mean-
time, he could ascertain that it was possible for
the cities of the District to pay then own debts
Mr KING, of Alabama, protested against this
law being interpieted as any guarantee on the part
of Congress, either to pay this debt or its interest
The question, then, was simply whether we shall
relieve the people of Washington ? He should
vote for the bill as it was now, but he would have
voted for it as it was ongmall y, because he thought
the Congress of the United States ought not quietly
to sit by and see the capital of the country sold
under the hammer
After some further observations from Mr
LEIGH, Mr KING, of Alabama, and Mr.
WAGGAMAN, the question of engrossment was
taken, and decided in the affirmative—yeas 27,

Smith, came up in order, when Mr EIill moved
the following as an amendment to his resolution
Resolved, That no evidence appears in the report
of any committee of the Senate which goes to
impeach the private and official integrity of Wil
ham r Barry, Postmaster General, that the extra
I allowances under his direction made to mail con
i tiactois, and the method of receiving combined
bids on advertised proposals for carrying the
mails, are a continuation of the former practice of
the Post Office Department, and that the defects
and irregularities of the department have been a
natural consequence of a want of a due organiza-
tion of the department by Congress.
On motion of Mr HILL, both the resolutions
and amendment were laid upon the table
The bill for distributing the proceeds of the
public lands among the several States,

the table
PUBLIC DEPOSITES.
The Senate proceeded to consider, as in Com-
mittee of the Whole, the bill to regulate the
deposites of the public money in the State banks.
After an immaterial amendment,
Mr CALHOUN moved to fill a blank in the
bill with the sum of two and a half per cent , the
sum to be paid by the deposite banks for the use
of the public money
After some remarks by Messrs CALHOUN,
KING, of Alabama, KING, of Georgia, PRES-
TON, KNIGHT, SILSBEE, SHEPLEY, and
EW1NG,
Mr BUCHANAN, in order to try the sense of
the Senate, moved to strike out the half per cent ,
which Mr CALHOUN, after some íemarks,
acceded to
Mr PRESTON then offered an amendment,
that when the average amount of deposites shall
not exceed $,100,000 quarterly, in any one bank,
the Secretary of the Treasury shall be at liberty
to contract for terms on which such bank shall
have the use of the public money deposited in it
Mr EWING moved to reduce the quarteily
minimum to £50,000, when a desultory deoate
ensued, in which Messrs CALHOUN, PRES-
TON, KING, of Georgia, ICING, of Alabama,
KNIGHT, TALLMADGE, BUCHANAN,
SHEPLEY, SILSBEE, WEBSTER, and
EWING, participated
On motion of Mr CALHOUN, the bill was
