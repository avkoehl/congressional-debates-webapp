PREFACE.

An act of Congress approved July 31, 1886, provided, in connection with the publication of the Records of the War of the Rebellion, that-

The evidence taken by the court-martial on the trial of Fitz John Porter, and the arguments made before the court by counsel for the prosecution and defense, together with the report thereon by Judge Holt to President Lincoln, and any reply thereto filed with the President before approval of sentence, shall be printed in connection with matter already printed concerning the proceedings of said court-martial.

The matter referred to as already printed appears in Series I, Vol. XII, Part II, of the published records. The entire record of the court-martial, with the review thereon of Judge-Advocate-General Holt, is therefore published as a supplement to said Volume XII, and is so paged that in anew edition of the Records it can be incorporated in Part II of that volume.
