HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND, September 16, 1863.

J. GUTHRIE,President Louisville and Nashville Railroad:

It will be absolutely necessary for your road to furnish us more transportation. The general impression is that private freight and express goods have preference over all others. I trust you will have this remedied at once. This transportation is a military necessity, and we must have it, even if we have to press the whole road into the service, which I shall not hesitate to do unless things are remedied.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.
