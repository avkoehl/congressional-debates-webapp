HDQRS. ARMIES OF THE CONFEDERATE STATES,Richmond, May 16, 1864.

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General:

GENERAL: Please order Major-Generals Samuel Jones and Patton Anderson direct (to save time) to send us with the greatest expedition a good brigade of infantry from Florida, taking those troops most accessible. We cannot specify, as the returns are so made as to exclude all information on which we can act. The cavalry in Florida is now ample to protect it.

Very respectfully, general, your obedient servant,

BRAXTON BRAGG,

General.

CHARLESTON, May 16, 1864.

General S. COOPER:

Your dispatch of to-day received. I have ordered General Anderson to form the whole of his infantry into one brigade and send it to Richmond with the greatest possible dispatch, Brigadier-General Finegan, commanding. The brigade will be small, and formed of battalions and unattached companies, but it is all I have in that State. I greatly doubt if one-half of the men ordered will leave Florida, and my order will cause desertions and disorganization. I have not an infantry brigade (or brigadier) in that department.

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.

RICHMOND, VA., May 16, 1864.

Major General PATTON ANDERSON,

Lake City, Fla.:

You will send to this city with the greatest possible expedition a good brigade of infantry, taking those troops that are most accessible.

S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General.

CAMP MILTON, FLA., May 16, 1864.

General S. COOPER:

Your dispatch of this date received. Will send all the infantry in this district, amounting to 1,100.

PATTON ANDERSON,

Major-General.
