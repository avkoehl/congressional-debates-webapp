Colonel TRUMBULL,

Commanding, Devall's Bluff:

The general directs that you send a scouting party in the direction of where Marmaduke is reported to be; strong enough not to be afraid of bushwhackers, and to skirmish the enemy should he be advancing. Scouting parties have been ordered out from Brownsville and Pine Bluff. If a gun-boat has not gone up to meet the boats from Jacksonport one should to. Please telegraph again.
