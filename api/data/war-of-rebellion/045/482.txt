Major General JOHN A. DIX, U. S. Army,

Commanding Seventh Army Corps, White House, Va.:

GENERAL: I am most desirous to aid you in every way. Last evening the Shokokon arrived, disabled, from the blockade. She has just come down from the navy-yard, and though with but one rudder, I hurry her off, to take to the White House fleet Captain Crosby, and officer in whose professional parts great confidence may be placed. My gunboats are all away, as you are advised, on duty occasioned by the present emergency, and I am left with but one tug for picket and other duties, and the transport Mount Washington for the mail boat, and all dispatch duties incidental to the demands of the hour. The public situation and my instructions from Washington require my presence here, to comply with expected orders, or I should now be with you. Recent rains must unfortunately retard your operations. Renewing my best wishes for your success, I have the honor to be general, respectfully, yours,

S. PHILLIPS LEE,

Actg. Rear-Admiral, Comdg. N. Atlantic Blockading Squadron.
