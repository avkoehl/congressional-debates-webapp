Send the following dispatch through to Fort Riley by messenger, traveling day and night, and notify me of time of departure:

Colonel FORD,

Hold the two companies at Fort Larned and send rest of Eleventh Kansas. Give them every horse you can raise. I have got horses on their way here to mount your command and troops to replace the Eleventh Kansas.

HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI,Fort Leavenworth, February 15, 1865.

Brigadier-General MITCHELL,

Omaha:

A part of the Eleventh Kansas will go from Fort Riley to Fort Kearny dismounted. Some horses will be sent from here for them and mount the remainder on mules, or put them in the forts and take mounted men from your posts. When troops reach Kearny we can decide how to move. I am trying to move the column from Sioux City; at all events, those troops will be where they can protect Northern Nebraska. We have no money. Will send your quartermaster some as soon as it arrives.

G. M. DODGE,

Major-General.
