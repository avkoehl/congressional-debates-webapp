The Memphis and Little Rock Railroad between Devall's Bluff and Little Rock, forty-nine miles, was the only line operated in this State. It did not come under my control until May 1, 1865. It was then in very bad condition, in consequence of the nature of the soil and neglect or want of skill in keeping up the necessary repairs.
