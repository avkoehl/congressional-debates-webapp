saving it. It is estimated that the damages done ,
l'rom these causes cannot be le^ than $20,000,000 in j
the lower peninsula of Michigan. In consequence j
of the fires tho stock of logs to be put in this winter .
-will be largely increased, as it is a necessity that the l
burnt timber must be hauled in within a year, or it â– 
becomes worthless on account of borers. j
A large stock of log3 is now being put in, in antici- i
pation of the increased demand caused by the lire-',
and any considerable addition to that amount from
Canada tends to depreciate tho price of all. It is .
estimated by many good judges that there will bean j
overstock in our markets without taking any foreign |
lumber. ' j
Thecutting of the logs in Michigan and Wisconsin I
has been made under the expectation that the Gov- i
ernment would not alter the duties, and if this bill I
is passed large losses to the lumbermen must result, j
The lumbermen of Michigan and Wisconsin, already j
large losers by the fires, are nofc the ones to contribute i
largely to rebuild Chicago. We have already been i
called upon heavily to assist those who have been I
burnedout of house and hornein our own States, and j
think we should not now be forced to pay beyond our '
means. i
Another objection to this bill is the difficulty of so
guarding the bill that it shall not be a means whereby >
large quantities of lumber may be imported free and
used for other purposes than rebuilding Chicago.
We claim that this is class legislation, and in a
worse form than could usually be the case, from the
fact that what is given is taken from those who,
according to their means, have lost as heavily.
