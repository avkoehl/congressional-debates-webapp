HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS, July 30, 1864-6.20 a. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

What we thought was the heavy line of the enemy behind the line occupied by General Burnside's troops proves as the sunlight comes out and the smoke clears away, to be our own troops in the enemy's position.

Respectfully,G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS, July 30, 1864-6.30 a. m.

Major-General WARREN:

The signal officer reports that none of the enemy's troops are visible in their works near the lead-works. The commanding general wishes if it is practicable that you make an attack in that direction. Prisoners say there are but three divisions in the works, and but one line of intrenchments, thinly filled with their troops. A dispatch just going to Wilson to make a lodgment on the Weldon railroad, and move up it to the enemy's right flank.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS, July 30, 1864-6.40 a. m.

General CRAWFORD:

General Burnside has secured a lodgment in the enemy's lines. I send you a dispatch just received. I wish you would take Baxter's brigade and half of Lyle's and make the demonstration indicated in the dispatch, if practicable.

G. K. WARREN,Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS, July 30, 1864-6.40 a. m.

General HUMPHREYS:

I have all my troops on my right except General Crawford's. I have sent him your dispatch, with directions to do whatever he can on the left with Baxter's brigade and half of Lyle's. Do you mean for me to move Ayres in that direction? The enemy have a 30-pounder battery on the main ridge in my front behind their first line. We cannot make out what this second line is.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS, July 30, 1864-7.30 a. m.

Major-General WARREN:

Your dispatch respecting attacking the enemy's right received. The commanding general will await General Crawford's reconnaissance before determining whether you should send Ayres also in that direction.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief
