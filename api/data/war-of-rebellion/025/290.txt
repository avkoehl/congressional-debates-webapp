Subordinates and privates must not pillage, but commanders may do anything necessary to impress upon the people that guerrillas must be driven from their midst, else they must necessarily share the consequences.

By order of Major General W. T. Sherman:

J. H. HAMMOND,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington, October 23, 1862.

Major General ROSECRANS, Corinth:

The disposition of the arms mentioned in your telegram was occasioned by the Department being misled by a person supposed to be acting for you. The error has been corrected, and a proper direction given, so that they shall be applied to the purpose you desire.

General Halleck will communicate with you on other matters concerning yourself, respecting which orders have been made to-day.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

JACKSON, TENN., October 23, 1862-10 a. m.

Major General H. W. HALLECK, General-in-Chief:

It is now certain that the rebels have been largely re-enforced at Holly Springs and are strongly fortifying. Pemberton in command. Tilghman in command of exchanged prisoners. They are re-enforced by conscripts, Alabama and Texas troops. Is it not probable that Bragg will come this way?

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.

You will direct Major-General Rosecrans to immediately repair to Cincinnati, where he will receive orders.
