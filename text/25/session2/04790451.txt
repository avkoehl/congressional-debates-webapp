CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

Mr. HOWARD remarked that, since yesterday,
it would be perceived the question had undergone a
total change. Then, the question was whether a
proposition was before this Government coming
from Texas for annexation; now, it was proposed
for us to make an application to that Republic.
Mr. H. then went on for a few minutes tul the
expiration of the morning hour, when the orders of
the day were called for
The joint resolution in favor of the authorities of
the city of Savannah, m the State of Georgia, and
the bill lo authorize the issuing of land warrants m
certain cases, were severally read the third time and
passed.
PREEMPTION RIGHTS.
The "bill to grant pre-emption rights to settlerson
the public lands" was then taken up.
This bill had been reported to the House, from
the Committee of the Whole, last night, with sun-
dry amendments, the first of which was the one to
exclude from the operation of the bill the lands
lately acquired by treaty with the Miami tribe of
Indians, m the State of indiana
Mr. LINCOLN then renewed the following
amendment proposed by him in committee:
In line thiity-urst, aiter th« word State*, add—
" or to any sections, or fractions of sections, oí
lands included within the location oí any mcorp >-
rated town, or to the alternate sections to othei al-
ternate sections granted to the use of any canal,
railroad, or oihei public improvement on the mute
of such canal, íaiíroad, or other publu mipiove-
ment, orto any portions of public land*;, mi rvoytd
or otherwise, which have been actually selected as
sites for citjes or towns, lotted into smaller quanti-
ties than eighty acres, and settled upon and occu-
pied for the purposes oí trade, and not oí agricultu-
ral cultivation and improvement "
Mr. L proceeded to advocate his amendment,
and demonstrated the necessity ot its adoption
from, among other reasons, the speculating attempt
lately made by a bill m relation to Sonthport, in
the Territory of Wisconsin.
Mr. HARRISON of Missouri opposed the
amendment, as inexpedient and unnecessary, the
effect of which would be to encumber and embar-
rass the bill
Mr, WILLIAMS of Kentucky advocated the
principle of a prospective preemption law, lathpr
than the piactice oí retrospective laws passed cveiy
two years*.
Mr. JOHNSON of Lom^ana advocated the
amendment.
Mr. CRARY was undei stood to oppose the
amendment, unless it was modified.
Mr. LYON infoimed the House that the Com-
missioner of the General Land Office had ruled
that the principles of the system applied only to
agricultural settlements
Mr. CRARY further opposed the amendment-,
as it was, in effect, taxing the labor of the citizens
for the benefit of the Government Mr C also
replied to the objection oí Mr. Lwror n on the
Souihport bill.
Mr. BOON appealed to Mr. Lincoln lo with-
draw his amendment for the piesent, to permit the
question to be first taken on the amendment m re-
ferenee to the Miami reserve.
Mr. GOODE caused an amendment to be read,
which he notified the House it was his intent on to
move, iq reference to the Miami Canal lands, in
the State of Ohio. lie asked the mover of the pend-
ing one to accept it.
Mr LINCOLN declined, for the obvious ground
that it c nflicted with his own.
Mr TILLING1IAST leplicd to Mr. Chary, and
contested the point that the waste 01 public lands,
selected for the public lands, were only made valua-
ble by the labor and cn'erprne of the settlers, be-
cause they selected them for their natuial advan-
tages.
The amendment of the Committee of the Whole,
as amended on motion of Mr Lincoln, which was
further modified by him, was then agieed to
The question then recurred on the following
amendment of Mr. Lincoln
To insert m the S6th line, after the words
United States, -and upon the third proviso in
said bill, the  following words  " nor £>hal! the be-
nefit of this act extend to any person who has be-
fore availed himself of a pre-emption right to the
entry of any of the public lands and acquired a
title thereto by reason of such entry."
Mi. HARRISON asked for the yeas and nays
thereon; which were ordered
Mr. EWING renewed his amendment to give
the State of Indiana the pre-emption right to the
lands acquired by the late Miami treaty.
Mr. SHIELDS contended that the amendment
was not then m ordei, upon the pending one, and
the Chur, (temporarily occupied by Mr. Connor,)
coincided m that opinion, and ruled it out
Mr WHITE, of Indiana, opposed the pending
amendment, but moved another, pioviding that no
person who secured titles under this bill should bf
entitled hereafter, &c
The CHAIR ruled this amendment to be, ¿Uo,
out of order
Mr. YELL opposed the pending amendm it,
and though he should vote for the hill if it vas
adopted, yet he should do so vt nh much reluct, ce
for it would bear very hard upon his constituents
as they were recent settlers, sit.ee the pa^s*>«te of
the last act. He could see no reason why it should
be engrafted on this bill, when no such provision
was to be found in the former one. Mr. Y also
advocated the original bill with much earnestness,
but avowed his readiness to c;o for any and every
amendment which would protect the rights of the
setileis, and prevent tht* perpetration of fu'ud
Mi   SHICLDS, also, opposed the amendment
Mr L1INC0LN advocated the juslue of its
adoption
Mr tSNYDHR opposed it, and went into i va-
riety oí del uK, showing how injuriously jt would
opeiate upon a most mi ntonou*. class oi c it/en-.
