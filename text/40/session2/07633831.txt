THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

owns the greatest amount of that whisky in
bond. These are the men who will be bene-
fited, not the honest manufacturers. The Gov-
ernment will be robbed and the whisky ring
will be enriched, and they will come here next
year when we get the reins of Government and
tell us we must have revenue; now raise the
tax again.
When the tax was first put on they were
about here convincing members of Congress
and Senators that it was unjust to tax the
whisky on hand, and by Congress refusing to
do that they made money enough to enrich
them; and now after they get this tax taken
off, and get the control of the thing, they will
come here next year and want the tax put
on again. I can see very clearly that these
same men will make forty or fifty million
dollars now by the reduction of this tax, and
having got it, they will come back next year
and try to convince us that we should put an
additional tax on whisky, that they may go to
work and buy it in in the mean time under the
lower tax. The operations in whisky are like
dealings in the stock of the Brie railroad, or
any other stock which has very little intrinsic
value. Men bet on it, gamble 011 it. A man
will imagine to-day that next week the stock
of a particular railroad will go up to a particu-
lar price, and he will get somebody to join
him, and they will make bets on it. So in
regard to whisky; ever since the tax was first
put on it has been a great matter of specula-
tion in the hands of the great speculators of
the country just as much as in stock gam-
bling.
1 am sorry that the Senator from Oregon
pursued the argument which he did, for 1 have
so much respect for his mind and fov his rea-
soning powers that 1 always listen to him with
pleasure ; but to-day his remarks illustrate the
strange perversity of the human head and
human heai t. When we imagine a particular
idea we always, if we have ability, as the
Senator lias, can find a strong argument in
favor of it, 110 matter how false its foundation
may be. I wish he was on the other side, for
then I am sure that in a couple of years here-
after he would rejoice if we keep this tax on
and save worthier objects from being taxed.
The IM' lvSI DENT pro tempore. The hom-
er" fi\e o'clock having arrived, the Semite will
tai.r a recess until half past seven o'clock.
Mr. MORTON. Before that is done, I
desire, for the purpose of simply saying, in
reply to the Senator from Oregon, that 1 did
not intend to charge the judges of the courts
with corruption. 1 did not speak words to
that effect.
The Senate took a recess until half past
seven o'clock.
EVENING SESSION.
The Senate reassembled at half past seven
o'clock p. 111.
INTERNAL T.'.XCS.
The Senate resumed the consideration of
the bill (H. II. No. 128-1) to change and more
effectually secure the collection of internal
taxes on distilled spirits and tobacco, and to
amend the tax on hanks.
Mr. SHERMAN. I wish to offer a couple
of verbal amendments before proceeding fur-
ther with the bill. On page 52, line six of
section forty-four, I move to strike out the
words " or rectifier" after "distiller."
-The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. SHERMAN. On page 39, in lines
twenty-nine and thirty of section twenty-eight,
1 move to strike out the words '' on his
monthly list."
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. MORRILL, of Vermont. I desire to
pionose a few amendments, to which I think
there will be no objection, which arc merely
verbal. On page 27, line sixteen of section
twenty-one, after the word 'โข distiller," I move
to insert ''or other person liable." By refer-
ence to page 2, lino fourteen of section one,
it will be seen that there are some other per-
sons made liable, and therefore they ought to
be included here.
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. MORRILL, of Vermont. On page 25,
line fifty-six of sect ion nineteen, I move to strike
out the word "distilling" and insert "pro-
duce." This is a mere verbal amendment.
It will be seen on the twenty-fourth page that
in the oath to be taken the word " produce"
is used, and the word used here should be the
same.
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. MORRILL, of Vermont. On pages 48
and 49, in section forty-one, line two, I move
to strikeout the words "seize and" before
" detain ;" in line eight to strike out "seized"
and insert " detained," and in line twelve to
strike out " seizure" and insert "detention."
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. McCREERY. I wish to move a verbal
amendment. In lines twenty-six, twenty-seven,
and twenty-eight of section fifty-two, there is a
clause which reads thus : "In no case, how-
ever, shall the aggregate monthly fees of any
gauger exceed at. the rate of $3,000 per annum.''
1 move to strike out the word " at." The clause
is not grammatical as it stands, and I desire that
this bill shall be grammatical, however errone-
ousit may be in principle. You cannot exceed
"at" anything, or produce "at" anything,
though you may exceed a thing or produce a
thing.
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. McCREERY. Imovethatwhereverthe
word " meter" occurs in this hill it, be stricken
out. It will take about one thousand or one
thousand two hundred dollars to buy a meter.
The Senate have already detei mined that they
will not tax the product fifty cents a gallon,
but that, they will tax the corn$l 50 a bushel.
That is the elfect of thelastamendmentadopted
by the Senate; and on that account, as these
meters will be so costly, I move that the meters
be dispensed with, and that wherever the word
"meter" occurs throughout the bill it be
stricken out, and that in place of the word
"meter" the words "sealed half bushel" be
inserted, so that the collectors of internal rev-
enue may furnish every distiller throughout
the United States a sealed half bushel, in order
that the tax of iil oO may be imposed 011 each
bushel of corn transformed into whisky.
Mr. TOMKROY. How would yon do that
where they make whisky out of molasses?
Mr. McCREERY. 1 am not talking about
molasses now, but of corn-distilled whisky.
My motion may apply to grain-distilled liquor.
The PRESIDEN Tprolempore. The amend-
ment is not now in order. There is an amend-
ment pending, offered by the Senator from
Kansas, [Mr. PoMERoy,] to strike out "fifty
cents," in line five of the first section, and
insert, "two dollars." That is the pending
question. The amendments which have been
received this evening were mere verbal amend-
ments.
Mr. COLE. I have to offer but a remark or
two in addition to what I said yesterday in favor
of keeping up the tax on whisky at two dol-
lars. which is the substancc of the amendment
of the honorable Senator from Kansas. 1
believe it to be conceded that the only reason
for reducing the tax below two dollars or one
dollar and a half is the alleged inability of the
Government to collect the higher rate. It is
argued that by reason of the high rate of tax-
ation upon whisky small establishments or dis-
tilleries are liable" to be started, and have been
in operation throughout the country. The dis-
tinguished chairman of the Committee on
Finance tells us that there are some exceed-
ingly small distilleries, such as could be put
under a desk or in a box and be worked in that
manner. That argument pioves to my mind
conclusively that in regard to this description
of offenses there are persons disposed to com-
mit small offenses as well as large. We have
many thieves, those who commit petty lar-
ceny, and those who would disdain to do that,
but commit grand larceny. Precisely the same
classes of characters, I suppose, exist among
those who would evade the tax upon whisky;
and if you were to put, the tax down to half a
dollar a gallon or to twenty-five cents a gallon
you would find these petty-larceny fellows who
would endeavor to avoid it even at these low
rates, who would make a little out of the eva-
sion of the law in that manner. So it seems
to me we shall not attain the end aimed at in
the report of the committee of putting the tax
so low that nobody will be mean enough to
evade the law. If we were to put, it down to
the lowest sum which has been mentioned to-
day, ten cents a gallon, in my opinion there
would be found men in the country mean
enough to evade the payment of the tax at
that low rate.
1 am not at all willing to concede that this
tax cannot be enforced at a higher rate than
fifty cents a gallon. The tax has been enforced
in some places at the rate that the law now
fixes. It gives me great satisfaction to be able
to say that in the first district of California,
which includes the city of Sati Francisco, there
has been no evasion of the law. I have before
me an authentic statement of the amount of
tax collected upon whisky during the year pre-
ceding the 1st of November, 18G7, in the first
district of California, and I find the amount to
be ยง1,803,458 for that year. I have also a
statement showing the amountof tax collected
upon spirits in the ten metropolitan districts
of New York, including the first, second, third,
fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, and
the thirty-second collection districts of that
State:

Tims it appears that in one district, of Cali-
fornia, including'San Francisco, there was col-
lected 111 that year off whisky within $(53,574
ot the amount collected in the ten metropoli-
tan districts of New York.
1 have in addition to this statement, not
before me, to be sure, in a form to present to
the Senate, but I have the utmost, assurance
that the tax has been collected in the portion
of the United States to which I allude. The
reason why it, is collected there is because the
officers have faithfully and honestly performed
their duty, and in my judgment not one gallon
out of twenty-five lias escaped taxation, while
perhaps scarcely a gallon out of twenty-five
has paid the tax in the metropolitan districts
of New York.
Mr. SHERMAN. Does the Senator from
California want to know why the tax is col-
lected in California? 1 can tell him.
Mr. COLE. I know the reason why.
Mr, SHERMAN. One reason is that else-
! where the great fraud is in the transportation
I of whisky.
J Mr. COLE. That does not meet the argu-
ment, because this whisky is in great part manu-
factured iu California. There are several very
large distilleries in San Francisco; but the real
i*eason that I would allege for this close ob-
servance of the law there is the fidelity of the
agents of the Government who aie employed
to perform this duty. They have done it care-
fully and faithfully. I know that some little
distilleries have been seized there, but very
little, however, out of the whole quantity manu-
factured in that city has escaped taxation at
the rate of two dollars a gallon.
