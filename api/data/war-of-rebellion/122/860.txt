Question 4. Similar details as to all two or three years' volunteer troops raised within the limits of Massachusetts upon what has been termed "independent acceptances?"

Answer. Prior to September 16, 1861, which was the date of the issue of General Orders, Numbers 78, of the War Department of the United States for the past year, all attempts to raise troops in this State by individuals on what you style "independent acceptances" proved abortive, and there are no corps now in the field which were raised in this State under any other superintendence than that of the State government.

aIn the table of infantry the present strength of the Twenty- eighth Regiment is given, and that regiment is enumerated as if it had already left the State, it being under orders to leave on Saturday next, and proceed to Fort Columbus, N. Y., and there to report to Colonel Loomis, U. S. Army, commanding.

bIn the table of artillery the strength of the Fourth Battery is computed from observation and from unofficial papers, that battery having been removed from this State by Major-General Butler, without any notice being given to the Governor, without any officers having been commissioned, and without any proper rolls of any description having been deposited in the office of the adjutant-general of the Commonwealth, of which facts the Adjutant-General of the U. S. Army was advised by the Governor under date of November 27.

Besides the troops thus above enumerated it is estimated that upward of 2,000 men have been enlisted from Massachusetts chiefly into New York regiments, of whom about 300 are in what is called the Union Coast Guard Regiment, now at Fortress Monroe.
