" RESURRECTION NOTES "
IN SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES,
February 12, 1838
Mr Grundy, fiom the Committee on the Judiciary,
made the following report
The Committee on the Judiciary, to whom was
referred that pait of the President's Message
which relates to the issuing and re-issuing of the
notes of the late Bank of the United States, by
the bank recently charteied by the Slate o£ Penn-
sylvania, by and under the same name, have
had the same under consideration, and present
the following report
By the act of Congress chartering the Bank of
the United States, passed on the 10th ol April,
1816, that institution was invested with all the
usual privileges of banking corporations, and was
especially authorised to issue its bills and nfties,
not less m amount than five dolíais, m the orduuuy
form of bank notes, signed by its president and
cashier These bills and notes, when payable on
demand, were made íeceivable m all payments to
the United States Tor the security of these and
lis other legal obligations, the capital stock vi as
created, amounting to thirty-five millions ol dollai 
Twenty eight millions of this were to be raised and
paid by individuals, companies, or corporations
The remaining seven millions were paid in by the
United States The affairs ot thecorpoiation were
to be managed by twenty-five directors, five of
whom neie to be appointed by the President of the
United States A committee of Congress was
authorized to examine into the transactions of the
bank, and legal proceedings were to be instituted
by the Executive, whenever any ol the provisions
ef the charter were violated The United Slates
were to receive, half-yeai I), a portion of ihe pro-
fits of the institution, couesponding to the portion
of the capital they subscribed
It will thus be seen that, during the existence of
the bank, and during the period when its bills and
notes were i«ued under the charter, the United
States were denvmg a profit from its transactions ,
that their funds were pledged for the secunty of
those who received and held its notes, and that
they were invested (at least so far as the words ot
the law went) with some control ovei its minage-
ment
By the same law, all the banking powers of the
corporation were limited to the 3d ol March, 1836,
after which day they entirely ceased, although it
was authorized for two vears subsequent thereto to
use its corporate capacity "for the purpose of
suits for the final settlement and liquidation of the
affairs and accounts of the corporation, and lor the
sale and disposition oi us estate, but not (or any
other purpose,;or m any other manner, whatsoever "
The objects ot this part of thp law are too phun to
be misunderstood The intention of Congress was
10 preclude, after the 3d March, 1836, every bank-
ing transaction—the issue of bills, the discount of
notas, the lending of money, in a word, thf conti-
nuance of all transactions for the profit of the
stockholders lb object was to prevent tne bank
lrom incurring, after that dav, any additional lia-
bility, by which theprcperty either of ihe United
States or individuals invested in the corporation
might be directly or indirectly bound, and to re-
quire the bqnk fully to settle its account and dis-
pose of its property, to redeem its obligitions, piy
its debts, and collect its assets before the 3d of
March, 1838
It appears that, on the 18th of February, 1836,
the Legislarme of Pennsylvania, by an act enti-
tled " An act to repeal the State tax on real estate
and personal propetty, and to continue and extend
the improvements of the State by railroads and
canals, and to charter a State bank, to be called
the United States Bank," incorporated the existing
stockholders of the Bank of the United States,
(excepting the United Stales and the Treasurer of
the United Slates) and such other persons as might
become stockholders, according to the provisions
of that act of the Legislature, previously requir-
ing the same, however, to be accepted by the ac-
tual stockholders at a general meeting. On the
19th of February, 1836, a general meeting of these
stockholders was held, without, however, any as-
sent, representation, oi authority on the part of the
United States At that meeting, resolutions were
passed, accepting the chatter from the Legislature
of Pennsylvania, and directing the president of
the bank to make that acceptance known to the
Governor of the Slate At the same meetine, the
stockholders thus assembled directed ihe president
and directors of the bank chartered by Congress
" to pay, transfer, and deliver to this new institu-
tion, all and singular the shares, parts, purparts, in-
terest, and properly whatsoever of the stockholder*,
so incorporated by the State of Pennsylvia, of and
m the goods, chattels, moneys, effects, and estate,
leal and peisonal of the present Bank of the United
States " Of thi  measme, no notice was given to
the Government of the United States, no applica-
tion was made lo, or authority sought from, Con-
gress, although it was notorious that a portion of
the t fleets ot the bank, in addition lo the sum of
seven millions of dollars, belonged exclusively to
them, that they wete enuiled to one-seventh partot
the effee ts to be collected and divided, and thai they
were hable, m the same proportion, for the proper
settlement of the affairs and discharge of the obli-
gations, which were thus summarily taken out of
their hands, and placed beyond their control
Though, in words, the direction ot these assembled
stockholders to their president and dnectors was lo
tiansfer their own shares and paitsof the effects,
jet, as those effects had never been divided, ns no
proposition for their division had ever been made,
as they consisted of the great and complicated mass
of property belonging to such an institution, and,
in the nature of things, incapable, without extreme
difficulty, of division, it was m facta sudden and
summaiy tiansfer of the whole property and ef-
fects belonging to the people of the Umled States,
and invested by them m that institution, under
circfully devised guards and stipulations, to a
State corporation, suddenly created, in whose trans-
actions they had no participation.
As it to remove all doubt of this being the na-
ture and intention of the transfer, the president and
directors of the bank chartered by Congress pro-
ceeded, on the 2d of March, 1816, the very day
before the charter expired, solemnly to resolve,
that "all and singular the money, goods, chattels,
rights, credits, and personal estate whatsoever own-
ed by, or belonging to, or tit (lie custody of this bank,
vihei esotvtr the same may be, together with all evi-
dences and securities for the same, be, and the
same hereby are, assigned, transferred, and con-
veyed lo the president, directors, and company of
ihe Bank of the United States incorporated by the
State of Pennsylvania," and they created that insti-
tution their trustee, to conduct and wind up the
business of the bank
Thus, in direct violation of the spirit, if not the
letter, of the act of Congress, which imposed upon
the bank chartered by itself the duly of ' settling
and liquidating the affairs and accounts of ihe cor-
poration," which had given it two years expressly
for that purpose, and which had retained for Con-
gress the power of examining, by us committees,
the correctness of its proceedings, and controlling
it, if necessaiy, by a summary judicial process, m
violation of this provision, and in manifest infringe-
ment of the rights of the people of the United
States, whose property was invested in the institu-
tion to a large amount, a portion of the stockhold-
er, excluding the United States, giving them no
notice, asking no authority from Congress, sudden-
ly assuming with a high hand the management of
the whole affair, undertake the solemn farce of
passing resolutions to create themselves (incorpo-
rated, it is true, by another law, though not under
another name) their own trustees, and, having so
done, they take possession of all the property, and
assume the settlement ot all the affairs of the insti-
tution, relieved, as they suppose, from every re-
sponsibility and control to which Congress meant
the bank should be subject in winding up its busi-
ness
On the 4th of March, 1836, when, m contempla-
tion of the act of Congress, the Bank of the United
States should have been commencing the settlement
of its affairs, including the large interest of the Go-
vernment, we find a portion of us stockholders who
have cast off the rest, seizing and keeping posses-
sion of every particle of the joint property, and as-
suming the right to manage it, free from the obli-
gations of the charter under which that property
was collected, and from the control of those by
whom that charter was granted and to whose con-
stituents a very large portion of that property be-
longs.
It does not appear that, at thp time of this trans-
fer, by a portion of the stockholders, of the whole
property of the bank to themselves, any inventory
or statement of ihe effects and estate ol the institu-
tion was made , and no steps whatever were taken
for the regular " settlement and liquidation of the
affairs and accounts of the corporation," as the
charter positively required. The whole business
was mixed up with that of the new institution.
Although the Secretary of the Treasury was desi-
rous and endeavored to obtain a payment or divi-
dend of the property proportionate to the shares
belonging to the United Slates, he was unabls to do
so Resort was, of necessity, had to an estimate of
the value of the shares, founded on an examination
of the general accounts of the old institution
There is, perhaps, no reason to doubt, on the whole,
the correctness of this valuation, but it must be
admitted that such was not " the settlement and
liquidation of the affairs and accounts of the cor-
poiation," stipulated for by Congress at the time it
granted the charter, and which was frustrated by
the summary and unauthorized conduct of the indi-
vidual stockholders, in transferring to themselves
all the property of the bank just before the charter
expired, and from the time of such transfer, nei-
ther keeping Us accounts or winding up any of its
concerns.
Soon afier the estimated valuation of the stock oí
the bank, thus made, the State institution and trus-
tee came forward, and voluntarily offered to pay
the same, by equal instalments, in September,
1837, 1838, 1839, and 1840, with six per cent, inte-
rest from the time the charter expired. This offer
the Secretary of the Treasury was directed, by a
joint resolution of Congress, passed on the 3d
March, 1837, to accept, taking obligations for its
fulfilment, the first of which, it is understood, has
been redeemed, and the amount paid into the
Treasury
Thus virtually terminated the affairs of the late
Bank of the United States, m a manner very diffe-
rent from that settlement and liquidation which
were a part of the obligations of its charter, in. a
manner very different from that in which the busi-
ness of a great national institution should have
been finally closed. It is true, the individual stock-
holders have become possessed, by a general sweep,
of all the property of the bank, and the United
States have exchanged their shares of stock and
their claim to dividends for a liquidated sum, se-
cured by the bonds of another corporation. But
have these operauons relieved either party from
their obligations to the community? have they
given to those possessed of the property a right to
use it, in manifest contradiction to Ihe charter by
which it was created? have they given Sanction,
direct or indirect, to an employment of the corpo-
rate privilege and the corporate property, long after
the charter has expired, for purposes not only un-
necessary to the settlement of its affairs, bat calcu-
lated to postpone and retard such a settlement?
have they absohed Congress from the duty,
solemnly imposed upon it, of « examining the pro-
ceedings" done under color of that charter' will
they justify it m taking no measures to redeem and
cancel the obligations of an institution it created?
above all, do they furnish it with an excuse for suf-
fering the name, credit, and apparent authority of
the United States, to give value to obligations w.
which they have no longer an interest?
Of all the powers and privileges of banking in-
stitutions, that which most widely affects the whole
community is the issue of bank «otes; the ambo
