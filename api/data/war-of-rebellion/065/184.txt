No injury was done to the work and no casualties occurred. No injury was done to the work and no casualties occurred. The firing continues this morning from guns.

The fire is from there 10-inch columbiads, and a 30-pounder Parrott is directed at the south angle, where some open arches have been recently filled from the outside, and which we suspect they have seen. Work going on as usual, and no damage done.
