P. G. VAN WINKLE,
Manages on the part of the Senate.
JUSTIN S. MORRILL,
GEORGE. H. PENDLETON,
S. HOOPER,
Managers on the part of the House.
Mr. SHERMAN. I will explain the report
briefly. Iris not precisely as I desired, nor as I
think a majority of the Senate would desire, but
under the circumstances is perhaps as good as
could be expected. The amendment of the Sen-
ator from Wisconsin, [Mr. Howe,] containing a
limitation upon the allowances for cleric hire,&c.,
is disagreed to by the House of Representatives.
The limitation of the tax on miners is agreed to.
The exception of Bibles and Testaments from the
general tax on books is agreed to. There is an
entire change made in the mode of taxing cigars.
The tax reported by the committee of conference
is ten dollars a thousand cigars, without regard to
the quality or price. It will be remembered that
the House proposed to tax tobacco in cigars sixty
cents a pound. The Senate proposed a scale of
taxes according to the value of the ctgars. The
committee of conference recommend that a uni-
form tax of ten dollars a thousand be applied to
all cigars except cigarettes, which are taxed at a
less rate. The amendment of the Senate taxing
gross receipts of corporations is agreed to. The
qualification of the tax on miners, proposed by
the Senator from Nevada, is agreed to. The tax
on savings banks is agreed to. The cotton section
is entirely stricken out, the committee of confer-
ence not being able to agree on anything m regard
to it.
Mr. HOWE. Leaving no tax on cotton?
Mr. SHERMAN. Leaving the old tax, two
cents a pound. The new section in regard to the
payments into the Treasury, and the reorganiza-
tion of the payments of the Internal Revenue Bu-
reau, is agreed to. The amendment of the Sen-
ate postponing until the 1st of July the tax of ten
per cent, on State bank circulation is agreed to.
The section offered by the Senator from Rhode
Island, [Mr. Anthony,] giving a preference to
existing State banks in the organization of addi-
tional national banks, is agreed to. The petro-
leum tax of the Senate is agreed to; that is, one
one dollar on a barrel of forty-five gallons. The
tax on sales was disagreed to by the House and
abandoned by the Senate committee. The section
authorizing the appointment of revenue commis-
sioners is agreed to.
There is a multitude of amendments of a minor
character in regard to which 1 shall answer any
Senator who feels an interest in them. I have
named the principal subjects of controversy be-
tween the two Houses.
Mr. HOWE. I really believe that nearly the
whole virtue of this bill is in that amendment
agreed to by the Senate levying a tax on sales, and
for myself I would rather lose the bill than see that
tax surrendered, i am as convinced as I can be of
anything that I do not positively know that that
is the most beneficent and most equitable mode
of levying taxes that there is known or has been
suggested in oar internal revenue system. Ever
since 1861 I have been ambitious of seeing that
tax tried. The Senate hasat lastagreed to try it,
and I do not like to have the proposition surren-
dered without a further effort to secure the acqui-
escence of the House of Representatives in it. 1
am not without hope, indeed I have a pretty
strong hope, that another committeee of confer-
ence might secure such a result. I did not par-
ticipate in the debate which took place on that
proposition in the Senate; I listened to it; it did
not affect the judgment which 1 formed three
years ago in reference to this measure*of taxa-
tion, and I am extremely anxious to see it tried.
If, however, the Senate think it better to concur
in the report of the committee, I of course must
acquiesce in it, but I should like to know def-
finitely the judgment of the Senate on it; and
therefore E ask a division.
Mr. HARRIS. I agree entirely in the views
that have been expressed by the Senator from
Wisconsin. I am not willing to adopt this report
without a further effort to secure that provision
in the bill. I am aware that this tax on sales
will fall as heavily on my constituents as on any
part of the country, and perhaps more so; but
there is no provision for raising revenue that has
been suggested which commends itselfso strongly
to my judgment as this, and 1 desire that the
Senate shall make one more effort to secure the
passage of this section. 1 hope, therefore, the
Senate will not concur in the report.
Mr. SHERMAN. Senators before they dis-
pose of this important bill ought tb reflect on the
condition of affairs by which we are surrounded.
The tax on sales I voted for myself; 1 am in favor
of it now; I regret that it was abandoned by the"
Senate conferees; but it must be remembered on
the other hand that it was adopted here by only
one vote, by the casting vote of the Vice Presi-
dent, and on another vote was only adopted by
two majority; that it was rejected twice in the
House of Representatives; that it is a new prop-
osition, novel in its character; and to force it
through the House upon the report of the com-
mittee of conference would be an extraordinary
proceeding. A majority of the Senate confer-
ees were opposed to it and voted against it when
the question was up. As a matter of course, no
other result could be expected from that confer-
ence.
Ou the other hand if you now defeat the report
and send this question to another committee of
conference it throws open the whole controversy,
and it is not possible physically to enroll this bill
if we should have another conference. At the
next session the subject will be brought up. The
Senator from New York asks me if we had not
better lose the bill. I say not. There are very
many important changes in this bill, changes of
detail which will remove ambiguities and I think
will add somewhat to the revenue. I do not think
there is very much in the bill of vital importance,
but all the changes which have been made are
improvements; something has been secured, and
I trust therefore that the Senate will not at this
late hour defeat this bill. I shall vote for it my-
self with some reluctance because the three taxes
upon which I most relied have been stricken out:
first, the tax on sales; second, there is a total
change in the tax on cigars; and third, the tax
on petroleum is now very much reduced; but on
the whole I prefer to vote for it rather than take
the chance of getting a better bill at this late hour
of the session.
Mr. HOWE. The Senator reminds me of an-
other tax which has been surrendered, and that
is the tax on cigars. I do not hesitate to say that
if that was the only objection I had to the bill, I
would vote against it on that ground alone, and I
will. I do not give my assent to a proposition so
monstrously unjust and unequal as to levy a tax
of an even ten dollars a thousand on cigars, ir-
respective of their valueâand they are sold for
all sums from one dollar to $200 a thousand; an
even tax of ten dollars on the poorest as on the
