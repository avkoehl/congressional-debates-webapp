Mr. DAWKS. I do not think it necessary
to say anything on the amendment now pend-
ing. We have already gone over the whole
ground, and I ask a vote.
The question being taken on the amend-
ment of Mr. Armstrong, it was disagreed to.
Tho question was next taken on the amend-
ment ot' Mr. Rogers ; and it was disagreed to.
The Clerk resumed the reading of the bill,
and read the following paragraph :
Department of Justice:
Office of tile AttorneyGoneral: For compensation
of tho Attorney General, $S,000; .Solicitor General.
#7,500; two Assistant Attorneys General, at $5,000
each ; solicitor of'internal revenue, $5,0ltP; naval soli-
citor and judge advocate general, $3,500: examiner
ot claims, S3,500; law clerk, $2,500; chiefclerk, $2,200;
stenographic clcrk J2.000; one clerk, $2,000; heven
clerks of class four; additional for disbursing clerk,
$200; two clerks of class throe, oneclerk of class two,
one clerk of class one, ono messenger, two assistant
inessongors j in all, SG7.320.
Mr. FARNSWORTH. I offer an amend-
ment for the purpose of asking a question of
the chairman of the Committee on Appropria-
tions. The amount set down here for the
solicitor of internal revenue is $5,000. I move
to amend by making that $3,500, for the pur-
pose of inquiring why it is that the solicitor of
internal revenue receives a larger salary than
the Solicitor of the Treasury. Here is a provis-
ion by which the solicitor of internal revenue
receives $5,000, while the Solicitor of the
Treasury only receives $3,500. Is this because
superior talents are required in the office of
solicitor of internal revenue, or is it because
the labor is greater?
Mr. DAWKS. The reason why the bill is
drawn as it is is just this: that the law fixes
these salaries in the way th§y are put in the
bill. The reason why the law fixed them so, the
gentleman from Illinois, [Mr. Farnswoh/jh,]
having helped to make the laws, must know as
well as myself. I think, however, I can ex-
plain the reason why. The compensation of
the Solicitor of the Treasury was fixed seme
time ago at the rate at which it. now stards.
The office of solicitor of internal revenue was
created at a time when the internal revenue
was considered of great importance because
of the vast amount of business, and his salary
was put up during the war to that point and
has remained there ever since. I do not see
any reason for it any more than the gentleman
from Illinois. There is no reason for it. The
solicitor of internal revenue is considered aa
subordinate to the Solicitor of the Treasure.
Mr. FARNSWORTH. Then I will ask the
vote of the committee on my amendment, to
make the salary of the solicitor of internal
revenue the same as that of Solicitor of the
Treasury.
Mr. DAWES. The Committee on Appro-
priations when reporting the bill were obliged
to make it in accordance with the statutes.
Mr. WELKEU. Let the amendment be
read.
The Clerk read as follows:
In line twelve hundred and sixty-six strike su*
"S5.000" and insert "$3,500;" so that it will r :ad.
"solicitor of internal revenue, $3,500."
Mr. W15LKER. I rise to a point of order.
The law has already fixed the salary for these
offices, and, as I understand, we cannot reduce
the salary fixed by law, although we may in-
crease it.
Mr. DAWES. I will state what will be the
effect of carrying the amendment. The solicitor
of internal revenue as long as he is in the ollice
is entitled to $5,000 until the law is changed.
If we appropriate $3,500 there will not bo
enough. There will be a deficiency of $l.f00.
If the gentleman proposes to change the law
fixing the salary he may accomplish his ob ect
in that way, but if he merely cuts down She
appropriation he leaves a deficiency in the
appropriation for a salary fixed by law.
Mr. FARNS WORTH. I add to my amead-
ment the words " and that no greater amo.int
shall be paid." I modify the amendment in
that way.
Mr. DICKEY. I rise to u point, of or< er,
that that changes the salary fixed by law.
I he CHAIRMAN. The Chair overrules the
first point of order, that taken by the gentle-
man from Ohio, [Mr. Welker.] The amend-
ment, as first proposed by the gentleman from
Illinois, [Mr. Farxsworth,] does not change
the law. Tt only lessens the amount to be
appropriated in this bill. It is, therefore, in
order. But the amendment which the gen-
tleman now proposes, to change the law
altogether and provide that no larger salary
shall be paid, would.be changing the law, and
