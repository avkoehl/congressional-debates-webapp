ANNANDALE, June 20, 1863-7 a. m.

Colonel J. H. TAYLOR,

Chief of Staff, Washington, D. C.:

Colonel: Our cavalry returned to Centrenville last evening, after visiting Wolf Run, Brentsville, and Manassas Junction. They captured 8 prisoners, among them the lieutenant-colonel who ordered the draft at Brentsville. Colonel Lowell reports all quiet in front. The railroad is in running order beyond Bull Run. A train leaves for Manassas this morning. We are on the move to Fairfax and Centreville.

RUFUS KING.

Brigadier-General Commanding.

June 20, 1863-6 p. m.

Brigadier-General ABERCROMBIE, Centreville:

Have you tools, and can you furnish a party to bridge to pike over Bull Run, between you and Gainesville? How long would it require to concentrate all your command at Centreville? Where do your infantry picket?

DANL. BUTTERFIELD,

Major-General, Chief of Staff.
