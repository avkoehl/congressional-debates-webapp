THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
December 4,
enee—the territory of the United States. Gentlemen argue
this thing as if that included nothing but the regulation of the
lands. Is not that a new idea? How Ring has it existed?
" Mr. Cass. Since the decision of the Supreme Court.
" Mr^FESs£N t:N. When was that ?
"Mr. Cass. Some twenty years ago.
"Mr. Fessenden. I cannot dispute the gentleman.
Then that is to say that there is no further power given by
tiiat clause of the Constitution than to take and acquire
land. Has the Supreme Court decided that ?
"Mr. Cass. j wiil state to the gentleman that the Su-
preme Court decided that ' territory or othet property,' in
that connection, meant lands. The Supreme Court decided
afterwards, independently of that, that tne power to regu-
late and dispose of the lands did include the right of juns-
diction."
Mr. BENJAMIN. Mr. President, it is per-
fectly obvious that on this very important ques-
tion,as to the numberof copies of the President's
message which are^p be published, we cannot
come to a conclusion without mature delibera-
tion. The destinies of the nation hang on the
solution of the question, as is obvious from the
interest it has excited. I, for one, after the presi-
dential election was closed, felt very much as the
schoolboy did after the long term during which
he had been studying the classics—" Thank
God, I have got rid of the Greeks and Romans !"
1 felt—" I thank God I have got rid of presiden-
tial stump-speaking;." Other gentlemen, how-
ever, seem to have different tastes, and in order
that each member of the body may have an op-
portunity fully to prepare himself for the discus-
sion of so grave a question, without intending
myself to participate in the debate, I obtained the
floor in order to move an adjournment, which I
now move.
The motion was agreed to, and the Senate ad-
journed.

MISCELLANEOUS PROPOSITIONS.
Mr. FLORENCE. Mr. Speaker, it has been
the practice, in the early weeks of the session, to
adjourn over from Thursday till Monday, so as
to enable gentlemen to transact business in the
Departments. Now, I have a good deal of business
to transact with the Departments, and I suppose
every other gentleman m the House also has. I
move, therefore, that when the House adjourns
to-day, it adjourn to meet on Mondav next.
_ Mr. II. MARSHALL. This is a short ses-
sion, and I hope we shall not adopt this practice
of adjourning over.
