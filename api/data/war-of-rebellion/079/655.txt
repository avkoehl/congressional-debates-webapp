NASHVILLE, November 5, 1864.

General SCHOFIELD:

Colonel Thompson from Johnsonville telegraphs that vedettes report the enemy east of Johnsonville moving toward that place, and one mile south of the railroad. You had better halt at Gillem's and concentrate your command before you go farther, unless you are certain upon communicating with Colonel Thompson that the above report is not correct.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, Commanding.

Stop at Waverly until further orders, and stop all troops of the corps there. I will be there to-night.

JOHNSONVILLE, November 5, 1864.

General SCHOFIELD:

I assumed command of the forces upon my arrival. I have my men at work and will have good works for defense by 12 to-night. Enemy's camp-fires in view; do not think they have moved any material force this side of the river, although so reported. Will follow your instructions.

G. W. GALLUP,

Colonel, Commanding.
