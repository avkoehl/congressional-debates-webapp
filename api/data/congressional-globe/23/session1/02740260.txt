THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
March 21,
in a word, all foreign coin, except Spanish milled
dollars, the coinage of which has ceased, and the
country stripped of al! that were in it, by the Bank
of the United States, are uncurrent, and illegal as
tenders, so that the people of the United States
are reduced to so small a list and so small a
supply of statute currency out of which debts can
legally be paid, that it may be fairly assumed that
the whole debtor part of the community he at
the mercy of their credi'ors, to have their bodies
sent to jail, 01 their property sold for nothing, at
any time that their creditors please To such a
condition are tne free and high minded inhabitants
of this country reduced—and reduced by the power
and policy of the first and second Banks of the
United States, and the controlling influence which
they have exercised over the moneyed system
of the Union fiom the year 1791 down to the pres-
ent day
Mr B. would conclude what he had to say on
this head with one remark, it was this that while
the gold and silver com of all the monarchs of
Europe were excluded from circulation in the
United States, the paper notes of their subjects
were received as current money The Bank ot the
United States was, in a great degree, a foreign in-
stitution Foreigners held a great part of its stock,
and many hold it all The paper notes issued by
this institution, thus composed in gieatpaitof
the subjects of European kings, are made legal
tendera to theFedeial Government, and thus forced
into c rculation among the people, while the gold
and silver coin of the k ngs to which they belong
is rejected and excluded, and expelled from the
country ' Hedemanded if anything could display
the vice and deformity of the paper system in a
more revolting and humiliating point of view than
this single fact'
Without concluding, Mr   B , at a quarter be
fore-four o'clock, gave way to
Mr WHITE, on whobe motion,
The Senate adjourned

THE PUBLIC DEPOSITES.
The House resumed the consideration of the
resolutions repoited from tne Committee of Ways
and Means, together with the amendment offered
by Mr Wilde, declaring that the reasons of the
Secretary of the Treasury for removing the depos-
ites from the United Sta es Bank aie unsatisfac-
tory and insufficient
Mr GILMER, of Georgia, addressed the House
The subject, he said, was one oí more interest
than any which had been discussed since the ori-
gin of the Government, and he tnerefore wished
to express the views which would govern his vote
His own situation in relation to the subject was
peculiar, for he should not vote o i the question of
the removal of the deposites on the same grounds
which otheis had taken He begged leave,m the
outset, to protest against the manner in which the
subject had been discussed When the gentleman
from South Carolina [Mi McDuffie] proposed
his resolution declaring that the deposites ought to
be restored, what question did we discuss> Not
the question of restora'ion, for most of the argu-
ments which we heard íelated to the conduct of the
President of the United States m removing the Sec
letaiy.and apoointinganothei The consequence
w¡>s, that public feeling was misled and excited,
and we weie led to consider that the question was
to be determined, not on us merits, but on our like
or dislike of the President of the United States
The question of the power of appointment was
connected, in fact, with the removal of the de
posites, yet it had no possible connexion with the
question whethei tlje public interests requn ed tneir
restoration to the bank The public inteiests alone
should deteimmethatquestion When the power
of removal from office was before the First Con-
gress, it was solemnly argued and dec ded Were
we now better piepaied than they were m cometo
a proper decision of the question ' Without say-
ing that their deteimination was right, he would
say that there never was a time when the state of
public feeling was so little favorable to a proper
determination as the present time
Another question had been made here, whether
the public money, after having been deposited
by law, can be íemoved without the authority of
'-—     Here he entered his dissent to the doctrine
advanced in favoi of this proposition Fiom th
manner m which the question had been discussed,
the people were misled as to the real question
befoieus What was the true question' It was
whethei Congress can sell the eight to control the
public money In order to ascertain whethei
the position which had been assumed both by Jie
majority and the minority of the committee was
correct, it would be necessary foi him to go into a
somewlm extended argument We created a body
corporate and gave it ceitain ri hts and privileges,
in oider to carry into effect the purposes of the
Government To effect these purposes both pub
he and piivate rights weie granted to the bank
by law The pub'ic rights weie confeired with a
view to effect public objects, such as the safe-
keeping and easy transpoitation of public funds
The Government, he conterded, had no right t6
change and modify these rights for the puipose
of effect ng the objects which weie intended by
law
One of the consequences which he must deduce
from this position was that the public money was
deposited, not so much for the benefit of the bank
as for that of the Government, and that Congress
coukl not sell their control ovei it or transfer it
An'mference had been drawn that oneof the ben-
efits which were confeired on the bank arose from
the keeping of the public money But this infer-
ence was had, without i egardmg, what he laid down
as incontrovertible—that the money could not be
deposited with that view He who contended that
this right was conferí ed upon the bank by viitue
of a contract made between them and Congress,
contended for that which Congress had no power
vested m them by the Constitution to confer    He
argued that this conclusion did not necessanfy
follow fiom the act of 1816 incorporating the bank
This inference, however, had not only been drawn
fiom the clause in the charter which conferred
exclusive privileges on the bank, but >t was also
mfened that the bank was entitled to be the depos-
itory of the public money, in consequence of the
bonus of one million and a half which they had
paid He contended that this bonus was paid for
tnat only which the bank had thenghtto purchase
or the Government the right to confer, and looking
to the fact that t'nere were man^Iarge capitalists
now to be found who were willing to pay six,
seven, oi ten times the amount paid by the bank
foi similar exclusive privileges, and without any
clause confiiming the right of the Government
depositing the public money, it was evident the
teims upon which they held these privileges weie
too cheap There was another argument which
he confessed he heaid with much surprise, by
which it was attempted to excite public feeling in
their favor—that was, talking of the sacred right
of chartered privileges, and the House had been
warned ho.w they should infringe upon these sacred
lights This made it necessary to inquire into the
origin of chartered societies, and there was no part,
perhaps, of the history of human society so inter-
esting to trace When originally granted, the
people had no rights, they weie considered in a
state of slavery to the church and feudal nobility,
charters were then devised by the crown toenlaige
those poweis whicn had been taken from the people
by the feudal system so pievalent in Europein the
earlier ages fo them, in consequence, the most
liberal encouragement had been given, and society
had derned from them more benefit than fiomary
other thing whatever Upon the original settle
ment ot this country, the colonies had obtained
them, to secure to themselves the enjoyment of
such privileges as they confened But at the
Revolution, by which our independence was estab-
I shed, they ceased to be of value Every man
became free, and that which was before so valued
became regarded as exclusive monopolies which it
was for the interest of society to abolish, as they
took iron), instead of adding to, the rights vested
naturally in every member of society
Having disposed of the argument by which the
right of the bank to the deposites was maintained
as arising fron contract, he wished to call the
attention of the House to what was the principal
argument advanced to justify the exercise of the
right of removal by the Secretary of the Treasury.
He would not apply himself to the sufficiency or
insufficiency of the reasons given by him, for he
cared not whether they were or not—his argu-
ment being to establish the power of the House
over the public money It had been said that the
Secretary might interfere in cases where the safety
of the public money was conceined, end that this
was the only case that could justify him But he
could not consider this íeason applicable, foi if the
safety of the public money only was to bethought
of, that safety might be attained as well by keep-
ing the public troney whet e it was collected, m the
shape of revenue, at the custom houses Such a
reason, when assumed as the only one, reminded
him of those sages who were looking into a deep
well foi truth, which was to be found on the sur-
face of the earth He contended that the public
moneys were lodged by the Guvernment for other
purposes than that of safety, that they might be
used through the bank, to fill up the vacuum which
was created by their collection, and thus be used
to advance the piospenty of the whole people
''Looking, then, to the question whether the depos-
ites should be restored to the Bank of the United *
States, it becomes necessaiy to asceitarn what the
conduct of the bank had been, to satisfy us what
it would Le He considered, according to the
adage, banks had no soul their end was to make
profit, and their conducl was actuated by this
motive But although he would not go into the y
charges against the Bank of the United States, it
was sufficient to say, that u ;on the expiration of
their charter, a renewal of it was of more imme-
diate ímpoi lance than any piot ts they could have
by discounts Such had been preved to be the
motive and conduct of the directors of this institu-
tion Was not the first apphcat on to Congress
for renewal of the charter made si ortly before the
presidential election'   Why, he asked, did they
