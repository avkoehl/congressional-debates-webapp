HEADQUARTERS OUTPOSTS,Seabrook's Plantation, S. C., November 7, 1863.

GEORGE O. GORDON,

First Lieutenant Third Rhode Island Art., Post Adjutant:

LIEUTENANT: I have the honor to report that at about 9 o'clock last [night] the rebels landed on and burned the dock on Bull Island. It burned quite briskly until after 12 p. m.

The pickets at Spanish Wells could hear quite distinctly the working of the oars as they came down May River, and saw them anchor their boat at the dock. Captain Findly, hinging they might make an attempt to land at Spanish Wells, threw out additional pickets and kept them out until morning. After the fire went down, nothing more was seen of them.

I sent apathy over to Pinckney Island yesterday. No traces of the enemy could be seen on the island. Two additional picket posts were discovered on the main land, opposite Pinckney. The enemy keep their pickets on Fortpoint, as bold as ever.

I am, most respectfully, your obedient servant,

LUCIUS RICHMOND,

Captain Indpt. Battn. Mass. Cav., Commanding Outposts.

FEESE, U. S. ENGINEERS, AND Brigadier General T. SEYMOUR, AND A PROPOSED PLAN FOR CLOSING THOSE APPROACHES.

The southern entrance is defended by Fort Caswell, by a work at A, and a work at Bald Head or Bluff Point.

Fort Caswell has been perfectly protected by a glacis of sand and by merlons apparently constructed some time since.
