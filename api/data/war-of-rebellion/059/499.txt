Don't move, only get ready. I will be down Thursday or Friday.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
HDQRS. FIRST CAV. DIV., DEPT. OF THE CUMBERLAND,Cleveland, April 26, 1864.

Brigadier General W. D. WHIPPLE, Chief of Staff, &amp;c.:

GENERAL: Everything has been quiet in our front to-day. Smith and Chandler, two of my scouts, went yesterday, between Spring Place and Red Clay, on main Dalton road, within 4 1/2 or 5 miles of Dalton. The rebel cavalry pickets are on this side of the Connesauga River at Kenyon's. They have a very strong line of infantry pickets 4 miles from town. Elijah Tucker, a Union citizen, left Dalton the day before yesterday. He says that there are very few troops there, not more, he thinks, than 500. Most of their troops are between Buzzard Roost and Tunnel Hill, and their number is given by rumor at from 30,000 to 40,000. Harrison's and Dibrell's brigades, with six pieces of artillery, are at the water-tank, 1 1/2 miles below Dalton. The rest of Wheeler's cavalry is between Tunnel Hill and Kenyon's place.

No citizens are permitted to pass the lines. There are no fortifications at Dalton, but it is reported that the enemy is fortified at Buzzard Roost.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

EDWARD M. McCOOK,

Colonel, Commanding.

KNOXVILLE, April 26, 1864.

Major General G. H. THOMAS, Chattanooga:

If we move as soon as General Sherman expects I will probably be short of transportation. My mules are on the way from Kentucky, but will probably not reach here in time. In that event, can you lend me some teams until mine arrive?

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

CHATTANOOGA, April 26, 1864.

Major-General SCHOFIELD:

We are very short of transportation, like yourself, and cannot assist you in that respect.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General.

LOOKOUT VALLEY, April 26, 1864.

Brigadier General WILLIAM D. WHIPPLE, Chattanooga:

The orders have been given for the movement of General Rousseau's troops. He reports that General Williams' command will be relieved by Thursday night. The latter is ordered to move to the front as soon as relieved.

JOSEPH HOOKER,

Major-General, Commanding.
