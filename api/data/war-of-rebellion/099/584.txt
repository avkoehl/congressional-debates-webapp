Colonel GEORGE A. STONE,

Commanding Third Brigade, First Division, 15th Army Corps:

COLONEL: In addition to the instructions you have doubtless received from Major-General Woods, your immediate commander, you will peace act as guard to the column, at the same time continuing and affording your escort to the pontoon train.

The rebel General Hampton, with quite a cavalry force, is in our neighborhood, and it behooves us to resort to every means to preserve out trains and the column from sudden dashes of cavalry.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

MAX. WOODHULL,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
