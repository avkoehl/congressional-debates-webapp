CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
He said this had been proposed by the Depart-
ment; the increase would be about fifty per cent,
on the whole expenses of the corps, and he did not
know as the Senate, considering the financial con-
dition of the country, would be prepared at this
" heel of a session to make such an increase in this
session.
Mr. WOODBURY opposed the amendment.
Mr. KINO thought it remarkable that the Chair-
man of the committee should offer such an amend-
ment, which he could not vote for himself. He
opposed this increase of expenditure.
Mr. MANGUM said there was no doubt but an
increase in the corps was required; but with a thin
Senate, at the heel of a session, and with a reduced
Treasury, he did not know as the Senate would
vote for it.
Mr. CLAY suggested the propriety of his with-
drawing the amendment, instead of having it voted
down by the Senate, so as Bot to prejudice its suc-
cess iu fuiHre, when it should be acted on.
Mr. MANGUM withdiew the amendmen'.
Mr. CALHOUN oppose the bill, at this late
period of the session, when no notice bad been
giveu of it from the Department, and when the
state of the Treasury was so reduced. It was the
commencement of a permanent system, and it
could do but little harm, to have it lay over to
next session, when they could be informed of the
Navy, and its wants. He would move to lay it on
the table, if the Chairman had no objection.
Mr. MANGUM hoped it would be passed now.
It was a matter of lwuspensabli? necessity for the
navy, and the appropriation was of much more
urgent necessity than the lavish appropriations
for fortifica ions that had been made, or than any
other appropriation that could be made for the de-
fence of the country.
Messrs. CALHOUN, WOODBURY, and BEN-
TON further opposed, and Messrs. MANGUM,
HENDERSON, and ALLEN s,dvocaied the bdl.
Mr. CALHOUN moved to postpone its iunher
consideration on the l't Monday in December
next.   This was negatived by—yeas 2, nays 38.
The bill was then read a third time and passed.
It appropriates $800,000, a part of which is to
be applied lor the purpose of making experiments
and improvements in the navy, by steam vessels
and otherwise.
The PRESIDENT stated that there was no
other buMtiei'5 on the table of the Senate; ard it
then went into Executive session.

So the reso ution was laid on the table.
[A message was received from the Senate by A Dickens,
esq Secretary, informing the House that the Senate had passed
the bill making an appropriation for the salaries and outfits of
diplomatic agents, with an amendment
Also, the bill in relation to duties and drawbacks, with cer
tain amendments
In all which amendments the Senate asked the concurrence
of this House ]
And the question recurring on the adoption of the resolution—
Mr WOOD of New York said he felt constrained to speak
upon this question It would be remembered by the House
that in theeaily part of the session he had offered a resolution
calling upon the Secretary of State for any information m his
possession m the premises He had also presented some ten or
fifteen petitions in favor of the prisoners He said he desired
to answer the questions of the gentleman from Massachusetts,
who on yesterday had asked who and what were those Ame.
ncan captives Mr W went at length into the proofs of their
citizenship and respectability, and said, although he did not
justify the act of theirtaking up arms againsta nation with
which we were at peace, yet he felt a sympathy for their pre-
sent condition, being treated as common felons, and subject to
the most revolting cruelties The resolution called upon the
President simply to consider the propriety of acting in their
behalf, and he (Mr W ) could see no objection to its adoption
Mi W thought that the fact that the Committee on Foreign
Relations was unanimously in favor of it was an answer to all
that had been said as to ltseflect opon the McLeod q uestion. The
distinguished gentleman at the head of that committee would
never have consented to its passage had it been injurious to
that controversy Mr W went at length into a defence ot the
resolution, replying to the positions of Mr Adams He said
opposition to it from that quarter was not expected The ^ nice
of the gentloman (Mr Adams) had been often heard m this
House against imaginary slavery and oppiession, and it was
with pain that he (Mi W)now heard him advocating a con-
tinuance of real slavery and oppiession The respect he en
teitained foi him would not allow him to say all he felt and
thought upon this point Mr W made an earnest appeal to
the House to adopt the i evolution
Mr McKEON lemarked, he supposed that the conduct of the
House, and the suggestions thrown out by some honorable mem-
bers on this floor, within a few days past, werenot fair subjects
ot remaik He expressed his surprise at the expiessionsof
some "■tntlemenon the questions which had arisen between the
United Slates and Gicat Bntain The decision of the House on
laying the McLeod resolution on the table was strange This
much he would say of the whole proceeding—itwasmostextra-
ordinaiv man American House of Representatives Heassmed
the membeis he neverwould consent to paiticipate as a parti-
san in any matter growimr out of a collision with foieign pow-
eis All party feeling must be sub«elvient to the honoi of tho
country That was dearest to his heart, and no matter who
led, he, for one, was willing to follow in that path which tended
to the preservation of the American chaiaaer He hoped no

Mi McK then showed thai the crime for which these young
men suffered was such as patriots had received our applause
Our own conduct had induced them to a jiaiticipation in the
struggles in Canadi, and we ought not to abandon them to their
fate The enormities committed durms that struggle by the
British were referrel to lie also referred to Pi eston's three
years in Canada a British work, to show that there had been
prisoners taken and sent out in convict ships to Van Dieman's
land They were probably Americans, and if there was any
doubt we should not hesitate to seek out their prisons—to go to
their jailors, and even, if needs be, cast ourselves at their feet
entreating their release.   It would be to relieve them in chains.
As for himself, in his private or public capacity, his efforts
would be cheerfully given to this work of chanty He did not
believe it would sacrifice one panicle of our dignity—of our
rights—or lead us into difficulty To ask this favor and to accom-
plish the release of his countrymen from bondage, was to ac-
complish a duty enjoined upon us bythe dictates of humanity
and of Christianity
[The morning hourexpued m the course of Mr. MoKbon's
remarks which will be given at length hereaftei ]
The bill making appropriations for the outfits and salaries of
diplomatic agents, winch had been returned from the Senate
with an amendment, coming up—
Mr FILLMORE moved its recommitment to the Commit-
t°eon Foreign Affairs.
Mr LEWIS WILLIAMS moved its commitment to the
Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union
Mr CUSHING (chairman of the Committee on Foieign Af-
fairs) said that personally he had no particular wish either way
as to the reference But he would remark that the Senate had
inserted a new appropriation in the bill, which would render
necessaiy its commitment to the Committee of the Whole on
the state of the Union
Mr ADAMS said there was also another amendment which
satisfied him that the bill should first be referred to the Com-
mittee on Foreign affairs He alluded to the amendment, as
he understood, striking out the appropriation for one of the di
plomatic missions He wished the bill referred to the Commit
tee on Foreign Affairs, that they might have the means of com
mumcatmg to the House the reasons and grounds on which the
appropnation should be stricken out He believed them to be
insufficient, and if no other member made the motion, he should
move that the House disagree to the amendment of the Se
nate.
The question was then first taken on the motion of Mr Lewis
Williams, which, by ayes 96, noes 53, prevailed
So the bill was committed to the Committee of the Whole on
the state of the Union
The bill from the Senate in relation to duties and drawbacks,
which had been returned fiom the Senate with amendments,was
taken up and referred to the Committee of the Whole on the
state of the Union
The bill from the Senate to provide for the satisfaction of out
standing Choctaw reservations under the 19th article of the
treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek, coming up on the question of
commitment—
Mr FILLMORE moved its commitment to the Committee
on Public Lands
Mr CHAPMAN moved its commitment to the Committee of
the Whole on the state of the Union
The question of reference was discussed briefly by
Messrs A BROWN, FILLMORE, CHAPMAN, STAN-
LY, LEWIS WILLIAMS, MORGAN, and CAVE JOHN
SON
When the question was taken, and the bill was referred to the
Committee on Public Lands.
REVI- NUE BILL.
On motion of Mr FILLMORE, the House resolved itself into
Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union, [Mr Bdr
fcBLLOf Massachusetts in the Chair,] and took up the bill in
relation to duties and drawbacks the question being on concur
ring m the amendments of the Senate
These amendments (which have not been printed, and
which arc not, therefore, in possession of the Repoiter) were
concurred in without discussion, excejn as hereinafter men-
tioned
The question coming up on the fifth -amendment of the Se
nate, to wit, to strike out "refined borax," and insert "boracic
acid"—
Mr WISE moved to amend the amendment of the Señale,
by inserting "and that the article of salt shall be free from
duty "
Mr FILLMORE raised the point that this amendment wai
not in oidei, on the ground (as the Rpporter understood) that
l  lepea'ed a pic existing law which imposed duties on certain
articles, thub miking them flee If this amendment was in
order, thetewouldbe noend to such motions, and the House
mnrht go into a general revision of the tariff
The CHAIRMAN decided that the amendment was morder
Mr FILLMORE appealed from the decision.
Mi DAW"SON of Georgia submitted to the Chair that the
amendment proposed by the gentleman from Virginia [Mr
Wise] was to amend the amendment of the Senate, by addins:
salt as a free article And the question was, could the House
amend the amendment of the Senate; Most certainly the
House could do so It was strictly according to the rules and
parliamentary law It was proper that salt should be made
free of duty if any article on earth should be And as tea and
coffee were admitted flee, why notsalt, a necessary of life, and
used by all classes
I he appeal was debated by Messrs FILLMORE, ARNOLD,
and W   W   IRWIN
When Mr  FILLMORE withdrew the appeal
Mr BOTTS renewed it
And the po nt of order was further dl cuss,ed by Messrs
BOTTS, ATHERTON, ADAMS WINTHROP WISE.
KING, BRIGGS, RAYNER, HOLMES, PROFFIT, and
CUbHING.
The CH AIR stated the gi ounds of his decision
After which the question wa  taken, and by yeas 9P, noes 41
the decision of the Chan was sustained
The question was then taken on Mi Wise's amendment,
and by  aves 84, noes 89, it was rejected
Mr WISE then moved to amend the amendment of the frc
nate, by providmethat " iron should be free '
Mr W W   IRWIN mov<d to amend Mr   Wise's amend
ment by including the articles "sugar, cotton, and tobacco "
Mr WISE withdrew hib amendment
And the amendment of the Senate was concurred in
The amendment of the Senate to the second section, which
amendment provides that none of the article  shall hereafter
bear a duty higher than twenty per cent  ad valoiem, com
ing up
Mr FILLMORE expressed the com iction that the operation
of this amendment, which, he said, would nullify the second
section, had not been considered by the Senate, and he hoped it
would not be concurred in
The amendment was discussed by Messrs FILLMORE,
WISE TILLINGHAST, DAWSON, and CUSHING
Mr FILLMORE moved to amend the proviso of the Senate,
bystrikmgout all alter the word "provided," and inserting that
nothing in this section contained shall in any wise affect the
