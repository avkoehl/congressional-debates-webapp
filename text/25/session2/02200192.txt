Mr GARLAND ol Louisiana said this was a very impor
lint meiaine involving the settlement oí two counties, m Lou-
isi ma, and of large tracts in Arkansas, and had been leportet!
on favorably by every commute© of both Houses foi several
>ptti  past, and bills passed by one body or the othei, and he
therefore moved the recommitment of the bill, with instiuc
lions to the Committee on Phvate Land Claims to íeport some
other bill for the settlement of these claims.

disposed of
Withteieience to an examination by the House itself, Mr

session upon ita discussion would amount io more than the
whole supervision of the subject di proposed by the bill Tt
