OMAHA, NEBR., September 9, 1862.

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

Powerful band of Indians returning from Minnesota into northern settlements. Nebraska settlers by hundred fleeing. Instant action demanded. Can turn out militia force-battery of three 6-pounders, six to ten companies of cavalry and mounted infantry-if necessary. Territory without credit or cent of money. Authorize me by telegraph to accept for General Government in providing immediate defense. Can do all that is necessary with our militia, if subsisted and paid by Government. Will exercise utmost economy and caution and energy.

A. S. PADDOCK,

Secretary and Acting Governor.

SAINT LOUIS, MO., September 9, 1862.

General MERRILL:

I can't tell when the paymaster will go to New Mexico. It is impossible for me to do anything with the pay department. They always have some orders which forbid their doing what is most important to be done.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Brigadier-General.

SAINT LOUIS, MO., September 9, 1862.

Brigadier General LEWIS MERRILL, Warrenton, Mo.:

I want to select a prominent case to test the question whether a bushwhacker can be shot in a proper manner. I want to know what I can rely on.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Brigadier-General.

WARRENTON, MO., September 9, 1862.

Brigadier-General SCHOFIELD:

All right. I will run him up for you.

LEWIS MERRILL,

Brigadier-General.

SAINT LOUIS, MO., September 9, 1862.

Brigadier General LEWIS MERRILL:

I think Poindexter had better be tried by military commission. I believe I can secure the execution of a sentence.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Brigadier-General.

WARRENTON, MO., September 9, 1862.

Brigadier-General SCHOFIELD:

I had intended to have him shot on Friday, but if you think the sentence will be executed he had better be tried.

LEWIS MERRILL,

Brigadier-General.
