Second Veto Message—Mr* Thompson*
H. of Reps.
constituentsand mine, what will the whole valley of the Mis
sissippi. say to this termination of our labors1 1 told you, m
a speech which I had the honor to mike on the passage of the
first bill, that the laoor and industry of the several Western
States had been subletted, by the deiansem ntof exchanges,
since 1833, to an annual tax of $5415000 ihe people of
these States will endure fail that their Government neht
fully and legitimately requiiesof ihem They are a patriotic,
generous, intelligent, just people They understand the course
of policy by which their interests aie affected and have never
failed to hod the a^ent who inflicta unmerited injury upon
them fuilv answeiable at their untemfied tubunal But, how
ever patriotic, geneiou", intelligent, and just they are,
there is a point beyond which endurance and submission cea;>e
to be a virtue Can itheexpectel hat they will patienPy sub
mil, and without a murmur, to a paltering and doubtful course
upon a matter about which they leel s> deeply? Why, sir, the
pHin and unpretending faimei oft íe West, though he be the
hatdy and adventurous pioneei before whom the foiest fills
knews and feels as much cí the deian^ement in exchanges s
the money changei of Wall atieet His is, the knowledge of
that best and most unerring tutor, expei ence He understands
verv well, that a-s >ou mercase tne rate of exchange's, anddimi
nish the means of the tiader to purchase his pork, coin, &e
you leducem i coi responding pre portion the price of the
tide sold Ii an unpretending boatman receive  m fsew Or
leans one hundred dollars m Louisiana or Mississippi money,
he knows that the^amount of discount to which it is ¡subjected
befoiehecan convert it into fundsavailab e at home, is adnect
tax upon his labor We had all piomised ourselves 3 cesta
tion ol thisstateof things We had hoped that a <mod currency,
proceeding from a well rrgula-ed Bank, would have ended this
constant dram upon our resomces But we are doomed to sad
and melancholy disappointment Thisenoimous dram must
continue for at lea^t three years moie More than fifteen mil
lions of dollars must the lab r of the West be taxed ft i t'n 
indulgence of Executive piepidice, and this m staken view
of Executive consibtency The while nation must suffer m
the sama proportion until the íe establishment of th stirrc
macy of populai opinion In this work c f national ledcmpuon
the Ameiican people knowiullwelLandwill faithfully peifuim
then duty
But let us look a little furthei into these veto messages I
have examined them m vain for that lofty and concltibiveaigu
ment which distinguishes the piuduaons oí piofourd int --a
gaciou"statesmen When fieneral T\ckson vetoed the bill of
1832, he did it witho it equiv cation, dodg ng, or subtei iuge
It was a bold and intrepid act ola bold and ni'icnd man Theie
was nohesi a ion, no hilt ngbetAeen two opinions JlepUced
himself upon the elevated giound ofpimeiple But in t' ese
messages we are struck with to such exhibition of Ux ecu five
fitness oi independence Theie is no grapp'mgof tneconbti u

will not arraign the motives of the Piesident for the choice oí
such language, or foi its application to those who sincerely
called themselves Insiriendo, buf I will say that it is much more
fitted for <* newspaper parasnaph than fot an Exhume docu

When he thu" applies 'o us language oí censure and i eproacr,
how graciously does he ask us not t > put-h mat ors. to ex

ThePtttoident asks us not to push our differences with him
to 'extiemcs" Iain ata ]o&¡> to know what meaning to at
tach to this language If he means that we ought not to con
tinue our difieience upon this question, he has enpyed am an
ticipition "too flittering sweet to be substantial " Sir, the
great Whii? party of this nition will pursue their course in
cauyms; out the true principles of the Co istitution, in despite
the opposition of Executive power The loss of a favontf.
measure of relief hut knits them more closely together with
"hookb of sfeel " As if a single spn it animated the entire mass,
they will yet stand fiim, with their rank* unbroken, upon the
1 broad platform of the Constitution ' Heie and there a sm
gle fngmentmay fly off, drawn by the cords of Executive pei-
buasion but it will be a lonely and useless block fiom the huge
edifice of their powei They battle not for men, but punci
ph s—} nnciples which have been consecrated by the labors of
half a centurj, and oy the "ever glorious ex imple" of n pati k t

thee eat battle of popular fieedom They look alore to the
Ameiican people, who aie with them in heart and sympathy,
and who will never sit idly at then fiiesides when their coun
try calls to the icscuc Let those who would disunite us and
them beware' Ihcy never eensuie until censuie is due, but
when the loud thundeis of their indignation aie heard in tht,
land the tempest will spend its foice
I have alieadv shown that Mr Tyler condemned in the
strf nge=t language of rtbuke, the conduct of Geneia! (ackson

to find a chant ib c motive for the act It would not be becom

General Tarkson butlpiefer to use h s own language as de
scnptiveof his condition
In the beginning of the speech from which I havea'ieady
quoted  hr said
"That if my mm expected that the chief executive officei of

not thought fit to do it He has left it "subject to political spe-

the "distress" which is ' produced by its agitation," and leaving
those ' interests oí the Country" which are "connected with the
currency," unprotected by the arm of Government In what
does he expect to find excuse? noes he expect it by insisting
that thib is the only matter of difference between us, and that
jn every tiling else he has come up to public expectation?
Why, sir, no man deserves credit for doing his duty He could
nut have at ted otherwise than he has, upon othei questions, if
he would—I wdl not gAy that he would have done so if he
could But this isthesreat question—soaring far above the

If the t hahce which he commended to the lips of General Jack
son was poisonous, let him not murmur if he should be con
sti lined to i rink it to the dregs
Mr ¡speaker, in this as m all othei debates heie, much has
been said having no lelation to the question before us Gen
tlemen have travelled Jiroutuf the way to talk about a dis-
tinguished Senatoi from Kentucky, in the other end of the
< apitol My fuend from Vuginia (Mr Gilmer") said, this
mornmg, that 'if Mr Tyler hadgivtn m his adhesion to his
goodcousm, 'Harry ofthe West,  he would have been yet every
inch a Wing " Does the President ¡ rofess to be anything else
than "every inch a Whig'*" Does he now give encouiagement
to the denunciations which are heape 1 upon Mr Clay—the un
nvalle 1 chimpim of populai freedom, at who«e defeat, but the
othei dav, he wepli Is not Mi Clay a Whig- ay, * every inch
aWhpy*' Did not Mi Tyler, foi tbatieasoi give' his adhesion"
tohiuTat the Haimburg Convention! Has he withdrawn that
'adhesion?" or does lie yeL maintain it with a view to his con
5istency—tne prime and apparent motive of his conduct? Does
any man requite him to give 'adhesion" to Mr Clay in any
othei bei^e then as Mi Clay truly adheies to Whist pnnuplce?
No sir, if Henry Clay is a Whig, ind maintains Whigprmci-
pies we isklam Co g ve "adhesion" to tho^e principles If he
refuses, be is nt t "every inch a Whig " Was he not pledged
to these before Ins election to the Vite Presidency'1 If he has de-
nailed fiom them oi feds inclined todo so, let him openly
avow the act mdht may at least secure a charactei fot can
