any power to punish citizens of the United States,
or even the officers of banking institutions,
except such of them only as the trustees of
the Bank created by ourselves, for issuing
these dead notes We intend to punish the
trustees under our own law, and them alone for the '
violation of ihat law. These notes may circulate
from hand to hand without rendering those who
receive or those who pay them obnoxious to any
punishment Even if we possessed the power, it
would be highly unjust to attempt its exercise As
I observed before, these notes have no earmark1:,
and no man can tell whether any one of them has
been illegally reissued by the bank since the 3d
March, 1836, or whether it was issued before that
date, and has continued legally to circulate in
tne community ever since
I repeat, I should be glad to see any Senator,
and especially any one who believes that
Congress possesses the constitutional power to
charter a Bank of the United States, rise in
his place, and make eTen a plausible argument
m opposition to the plain and almost self-evident
positions whieh I have taken in support of the
power to pass this bill Those Senators who doubt
or who deny our power to create such a bank are
placed in a different situation, because their vote in
favor of this bill might at first view seem, by im-
plication, to concede that power. This objection
does not appear to me to be sound That question
cannot be fairly raised by this bill. Whether (he
charter of the late Bank was constitutional is no
longerafair subject ot consideration It was adopted
by Congress, approved by the President, and after-
wards prononnced to"be constitutional by the h gh-
est judicial tribunal of the land It thus received
every sanction necessary to make it binding on the
people of the United State  The question wis thus
settled beyond the control of any individual, ard it
was the duty of every good citizen to submit Un-
der every Government there must be a time when
such controversies s-hall cease, and you might now
as well attempt to exclude Louisiana from the
Union, because jou may believe her admission was
unconstitutional, a-, to act upon the principle, m the
present case, that Congress had no pow er to char-
ter the late Bank. No man on this floor had ever
avowed that he would vote to repeal the charter of
the late Bank, during the twenty >ears of its exist-
ence, because he might have thought it was origi-
nally unconstitutional During this period all were
obliged to submit Under such circumstances, it
would be carrying constitutional scruples very far,
indeed, for any gentleman to contend that, although
the Bank has existed under the sanction of a law
which we were all bound to obej, we cannot no v
execute that law and close its concerns, because, as
individuals we may have deemed it to be originally
unconstitutional II it h>d been so, the obligation
upon us would only be the stronger to wind it up
finally, and thus terminate its exis'ence
I most cheerfully admit tnat if an attempt should
ever be made to charter another bank, the question
of constitutional power would then again be referred
to each individual member of Congress, to be de-
cided according to the dictates of his own judgment
and his own conscience
Before I take my seat, I intend to make some
remarks on the causes of the suspension of specie
payments by the banks of the country, and the
causes equally powerful whieh must, and that
ere long, compel a resumption
The late manifesto issued by the present Bank
of the United States displays, upon its face, that it
has inherited from the old bank an unconquerable
disposition to interfere in the politics of the coun-
try This has been its curse, its original sin, to
which it owes all its calamities and all its misfor-
tunos It has not >et learned wisdom from its
severe experience. Would that it might, and con-
fine itielf to its appropriate sphere ' As a citizen
of Pennsylvania, I most ardently and devoutly
express this wish It has now set itself up, as the
primary power, against the resumption of specie
pajments, and has attempted to enlist m the same
cause all the other banks of the country Its lan-
guage to them is,'that " the Bank of the Umt d
States makes common cause with the other banks "
And again   K They (the bante) are now safe and

strong, and they should not venture beynrd their
entrenchments, while the enemy is m the plain
befoie them " " The American banks should do,
in short, what the American army did at New
Orleans, stand fast behind their cotton bales, until
the enemy has left the country "
Thus whilst every eye and every heart was di-
rected to the ianks, expecting anxiously from them
a speedy resumption ol specie pajments, this grand
regulator of the currency has proclaimed to the
country that all its vast power will be exerted to
prevent the accomplishment of our wishes
The Bank does not even attempt to conceal the
fact that, in pursuing this course, it has been ac-
tuated by political hostility against the presen' Ad-
ministration It has boldly avowed that " if the
banks resume, and are able, bv sacrificing the
community, to continue for a few months, it will
be conclusively employed at the next elections to skoio
that the schemes of the Executive are not as destructive
as they will prove hereafter " In plain language,
the banks must not resume before the next elec-
tions , they must not open their vaults, pay their
honest debts, and thusreJeem the country frois the
curse of an medeemable paper currenc, , because,
if they should, this may operate in favor of the
present Administration, and place its opponents in
a minority And such is the conduct of the Bank
whilst it vaunts its own ability to resume imme-
diately
The Bank proceeds sti'l f irther, and complains
that "bank notes are pro cnbed not merely from
the land offices, but from all pavments of ever)
description to the Government " I wou'd ask, h-s
any Senator upon this lloor, has any statesman of
any party m the counlrv ever raised h v o ce ir

that «Jthough I conside-ed the r propos > on most
unwise and impolitic, and resisted it a< sjch at be
time, yet they intended by thiN means to enable the
b anks the sooner to resume specie pa} ments
Mr Preston It was exclusively limited to that
consideration.
Mr Buchanan Although the proposition was
limited to the first of August, the Senator  them-
selves, upon reflection, thought it so imjroper that
they abandoned it, and we hav e heaia nothing of it
since
What would have been the condition of the coun-
try, at the present moment, had ne recened irre-
deemable bank notes in pavment of me public
dues? The banks, by our conduct, would have
been encouraged to increase their disc units and
expand their issues, and we should n?ve gone
from bad to worse, until, at this moment, we
should have had no prospect of ihe resm ption c
specie piyments Mr Cheves has ir>formed us
that if the Government had rot stood firm in 1819
against the receipt of irredeemable nt tes the banks
would at that per od ha\e suspended Much more
necessary is it that «e should now rnam'ain the
same ground, m order to secure a resumption
Had we pursued anj other course, it i> tiue we
should have had but one currency for the Govern-
ment and the people, but it would have been a
currency of irredeemable bank ra?s, without the
hope oí a better And yet the Bank of the Um'ed
Stales complains that the Gov ernment does not re-
ceive such paper. In order to have done so we
must have repealed the existing laws upon the stu
ject, and who has ventured to propose any such
measure7
The Bank of the United St? tes has ^ucceede^, at
the late Bank Convention m New Yt rk, in keep lg
its forces behind their cotton bales The banks of
only two States in the Union have voted asamst
the resolution to suspend the resumption ot specie
payments until the fiist da} of J-inmrv ne\
These were New York and Mississippi and
whether the latter voted thus because their Ian! s
are ready now to resume, or desired to pi tpotie
resumption until a still more distant dav, I shall
not pretend to determine After this displav of
power, no one will question the ability of the Bank

less they should be driven into the p'am by the re-
sistless power of public opinion.
Several weeks ago I attempted to ími'ate the
lllu trious examples which had been set before me
on this floor, and became a political prophet I
then predicted that, before the close of the present
jear, commerce and manufactures would again
revive and flourish, and the country would b«
restored to its former prosperity. The signs of the
times have already confirmed the truth of this pro-
phecy Encouraged by past experience, I shall
venture to make another prediction There is not
a sound ard solvent bank in any of the Atlantic
States of this Union, including the Bank of the
United States, which will not have resumed specie
payment long before the first of January All

able to keep its forces behind their cotton bags un-
til so late a period
It is now to j late in the day for us any longer to
doubt what was the true cause of the suspension of
specie payments That quesjon has been settled
on the other side as well as on this «lde of the At-
lantic Abundance of light has been shed upon
this subject, and no two sound-judgmsmen, at all
