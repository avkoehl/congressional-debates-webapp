MERIDIAN, April 3, 1865.

Brigadier-General HODGE,

Jackson:

Have you information that would lead to the belief that the enemy are making raid from Vicksburg under cover of the exchange of prisoners? It is very probable they may do so, having moved all troops from Eastport, and it is of utmost importance to know it at once. Where is Powers' regiment? Answer to-night.

E. SURGET,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

MERIDIAN, April 3, 1865.

Brigadier-General HODGE:

I have no information from Vicksburg, but merely suspect one. If you can, send me information from Big Black before morning. If affairs in lower district will permit, you had better order Powers' command to point you indicate, where it can easier join Ross if suspected movement should occur.

By order:

W. F. BULLOCK, JR.

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Brigadier-General HODGE,

Jackson:

Enemy entered Selma last evening; have no particulars yet. Forrest had no engagement with them. Suppose he could not get up in time.

E. SURGET,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

MERIDIAN, April 3, 1865.

Brigadier General WIRT ADAMS,

West Point:

Enemy reported to have entered Selma last evening; portion of the town said to have been burned. Have no particulars.

E. SURGET,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

MERIDIAN, April 3, 1865.

Brigadier General WIRT ADAMS,

West Point:

Prepare immediately to move east, via Pickensville, with every available man of your own and Scott's (Louisiana) brigade. You will take only your ordnance train, necessary cooking utensils, and hard bread, as your line of march will furnish bacon. A staff officer goes by special train this evening to deliver you your instructions. Send at once a scouting party, under reliable officer, toward Selma, via Marion and Greensborough, to learn if possible whereabouts of enemy and of Generals Forrest, Chalmers, and Jackson, with instructions to inform them
