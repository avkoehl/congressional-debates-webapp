Numbers 2. Report of Major James Wilson, Third Missouri State Militia Cavalry.
HDQRS. THIRD MISSOURI STATE MILITIA CAVALRY,Pilot Knob, Mo., December 30, 1863.

SIR: In compliance with your orders of the 23rd instant, I left Pilot Knob, in command of 200 men, about 10 a. m. December 23, 1863, arriving at Patterson at 9 p. m. Left there at daylight on the 24th, and encamped at Long's at 9 p. m., having traveled 35 miles. Marched again at 3 a. m. 25th instant; passed through Doniphan, taking a southwesterly direction toward the Arkansas line. Eight miles from Doniphan, I captured 2 pickets; 2 miles farther I captured one other post, and still 2 miles farther on came upon a rolling picket or patrol, and run them off of the road, capturing 1 and compelling him to lead us to the camp of Reves.* Arriving at the camp, I divided my men into two columns, and charged upon them with my whole force. The enemy fired, turned, and threw down their arms and fled, with the exception of 30 or 35, and they were riddled with bullets or pierced through with the saber almost instantly. The enemy lost in killed about 30; wounded mortally, 3; slightly 2; total killed and wounded, 35. Prisoners captured, 112; horses, besides those of Company C, 75; also all their arms, ammunition, and camp equipage. Not having means of transportation, I was compelled to destroy the bigger portion of the arms and all the tents and other camp equipage.

On the morning of the 26th, I started for Pilot Knob, arriving here about 4 p. m. on the 29th of December, 1863.

I cannot speak in too high terms of praise of the officers and men under my command. There was no loss on our side in killed and wounded.
