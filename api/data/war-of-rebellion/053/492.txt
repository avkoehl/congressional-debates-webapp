The above exhibits the amount of stores now on hand. A sufficiency of beef-cattle is in charge of post commissary, and distributed as wants of the army require it. A large lot of cattle are being pastured in the vicinity of Newton Station, from which any unusual wants of the army can be promptly supplied. The wareroom accommodations at this point could be extended to 75,000 or 100,000 additional rations. At Forrest Station there is a fine, large, and commodious depot building that would store from 500,000 to 600,000 rations. For protection of stores and convenience in shipping promptly this place is superior to any other point on line of railroad. A detail of a company of men for fatigue purposes, and as guard, would be necessary if it should be adopted as a depot for accumulating stores.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Major and Assistant Chief of Subsistence.
