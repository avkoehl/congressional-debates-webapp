Lieutenant General L. POLK,

Commanding Right Wing, Army of Tennessee:

GENERAL: Large bodies of infantry and several batteries have been crossing the river at the lower bridge for the last hour, and moving up the Anderson Valley road. Captain Maney reports the enemy crossing on both bridges with infantry, artillery, wagons, and ambulances. They are crossing rapidly at the lower bridge. Large bodies are now on the banks awaiting to cross.

Yours, &amp;c.,

GEO. E. TABB,

Lieutenant and Signal Officer.

If convenient I should like to have another courier, as I do not think one will do.

GEO. E. TABB.

HEADQUARTERS, Near Chattanooga, September 25, 1863.

General S. COOPER:

Does administration of the Department of East Tennessee as a department still exist with me, subject to the orders of General Bragg for strategic combinations? I ask this because General Bragg has given about half the command I brought to him to another officer.

S. B. BUCKNER,Major-General.

[Indorsement.]

OCTOBER 1, 1863.

The administration of Department of East Tennessee does not exist with you so long as you are beyond the limits of that department and are under the orders of General Bragg for strategic combinations.
