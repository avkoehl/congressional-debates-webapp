Colonel R. N. ADAMS,

Commanding Second Brigade:

You will proceed with your command at 7 a. m. to-morrow, the 8th, with the forage train of this DIVISION, under the charge of Captain H. R. Benjamin, acting assistant quartermaster, in pursuit of forage to supply this command. You will keep the train well covered and take the necessary precaution to prevent wagons or men from being picked up by the enemy. If possible, you will return on the same day. Your command will report at the office of Captain Benjamin at the hour above mentioned, who will give you the necessary information as to direction and distance. A portion of the troops will be used to load the wagons, which it is desired should all be filled, as we are much in need of forage.
