Tins is .independent oí the cost of punting, thai was an act of
the House Such was the interest felt by the House and the
whole community in the tesultof the investigaron, affecting,
as it did, a most important branch of the Lxectttive department
of the Government, and the management oí the finances of the
nation, that the House, by unanimous vote, adopted aresolution
to print 5,000 extia copies of both the majority and minority ie
port, so that the whole case might be fairly placed in possession
of the American people But, to prevent all cavil, I here pre,
sent astatement of the expenses of prmiwg the reports They
are as follows

But suppose, Mr Speaker, the expense-" oí this investigating
committee had been five, ten, oi even twenty timet, the actual
amount, what of that? Would you judge the necs^ty or pro
prteiy of investigating into any alleged fiaud or corruption n
any department oí the Government by the dolíais and cents
which it would cost? Suro y, surely not I am confident my
colleague would repudiate with scorn and irdignation such an
idea    Yet such, would be the effect of his amendment
Mr Speaker, I did not originate the investigation chaiged
uponthatcommittee At <,he pieceding session, my honorable
colleague [Mr Wi-e] had thrice offered a resolution proposing
this investigation When I offered the ícsolution which was
adopted, it was force 1 upon me by cucumstances I had offeied
aresolution calling upon the Tieasui y Department foi mfoi
mation uponasubject of a to ally diifeient charactei, pending
that resolution, a gentleman from Kentucky [Mi Hat an] oí
fered an amendment, calling upon tneDepaitment for miotma
tion upon the identical subject irlened to the committee I ait
mg to disetnbanass my re'olut on lioin this amendment and
feeling wel1 satisfied that any answer fiom tht Dcpaitment,
however conect, would notbe satisfactory, the Be pan ment be
nig itself implicated, I detei mined to pic pose an inquiry n a
loim which would beatonceth>cti\e and satisfactory, and with
that view I propose 1 to Mi Haplan towithdvaw his amend
ment, which he did, and offered the resolution oisamzing the
committee, which was unanimously adopted Tor this act,
forced upon me as it was by cucumstances, and for the course
which I feit it my duty to pursue upon that committee, I am
informed by a letter now in my possession, from a highly ciedit
able source, th.it a newspaper coirespondentwas called upon
and earnestly urged to denounce me tluough the columns of the
Albany Argus ' Notwithstanding the resolution was unam
mously adopted, and that the resolution which oiganized the
committee of wmch my co league [Mr Wise] was cburman,
embracing amucn more general an ¡extended scope of inquuy,
was offered and its adoption earnestly messed by Mr \ inder
poeI,adecid d ft unci oí the Adminioti ation, and adopted with
bat seventeen dissentients itaeemt  I w as the only victim—I was
tobe destroved
Mr Speaker, I never dis-chaiged anv duty, cithei public oi
private, committed to my chaige, more faithfully, more ho
neatly, or more conscientiously, in my life, than I did upon that
occasion When resolutions of the same cmractei weiepie
viously offered by my colleague, [Mi Wise } 1 uniformly
voted for then adoption, because I thought if the chai ¡tr t, which
had been made, and that too from such high and resectable
sources, were true, it was due to the nation that they should be
detected and exposed, if not, that it was due to the Administra
non and the head of the Treasury Department, that the fal=*e
impressions which existed should be removed, ande Hue conn
dence restored When I offered the tesolution which was
adopted,I stated mo4 distinctly and unequivocally, that I did
not think the chaiges were true, but, if they were, thit eveiy
friend oí the Administration, and of the putity oi om Govern
ment, should desire to know it, if not that then the lespona bt
lity would 1all on those who had made the accusation

fiooi, men in whose honor and sinceuty I had entue conn lei ce
asserted upon the authority of information winch they hal
received, their belief in the exigence of the illicit conn etion
which was charged to exist between an i idividual and the
Treasmy Department A his I thought sufficient, not only to
justify, but imperiously to require the investigation In ti e
piogressof the investigation I was delicately situated, I was a
friend of the Adminitiation, I was the movei of the íesi ution
organizing the committee, I was iti  chanman, and, n í bal
been cuntí oiled by policy alone, it woul 1 have been suicidal m
me to have opp tsed the mostlatitudmousinquny ot which the
subject was. susceptible, butlwas notcontioiled by poli v, I
was controlled by a sense of duty to the count] y as wfll s *a
the parties implicated, and by this rule  h *ped my tour e
The diflei enees of opinion which ai ose as to the admissibility
of testimony were natural and to be expected Jn Spea'ier,
I will state to the Hou°e that Grneral Jackson himself desired
these investigations and although I did not know it until after
I had taken my couise, yctlam informed, on indubitable autho
riry that he hod prepaieda paiagraph in his annual M-s age,
inv ting Congress, to institute investigation into these very sub
jects but, upon reflection, determined to express his confidence
in the ability and integrity "with which the Txecutive D"  art
ments had been admimsteied, and leave Congiess to adopt that
con rse which it might deem most expedient
Mr Speaker, the report of that committee, and theit3uUof
Us in vesication, are before the country for its unbiassed and
impartía! judgment I will express no opinion comen i"sr it
enly that its laboisweie atduous aud mce^ant, not surpassed
by those of any comm ttee which was ever organiz d I y tin*

the country whethev as affecting the management ol the Tie i

system, is worthronmtely beyond th1 pi tiy sum whrh it con

Mr Wise I call upon my colleague m ->mcei itv and can
dor tosay whether the production ot tht wool dp iettei is
rot of *tself worth the whole cost,
Ldo not now íecollect with sufficient accuracy the contents of
the ll%oool dip" letter, to answer my colleague satisfactorily
I recollect that that letter made a very strong impres&ion upon
my mind
Thave no inclination, Mr Speaker, to assume responsibility
that does not belong to me 1 certainly am not entitled to the
ci edit of originating that investigation, but, if it suits the views
of any to place the responsible y of either thp paternity or the
expense of that committee on my shoulders, for good oi for
evil, (or weal or for wo, I am willing to taken to the utmost
extent, and when called to account, will discharge th it respon
ability most amply, by pointing to the contents of the report it
self I willoniysaj, thu that document will disclobc the (act,
that the Secretaiy of the Treasury was giving that identical or

other and more impoiwint objects in view than to ascertain the
mere expenses of these committee He contended that these
(ommutee**, under the authoi itv to <=end foi persons and papers

did not necessarily or properly grow out of that authority an I

House, anil thu^e whicn it may cottfej upon it1' committees, let
him offer a separate and distinct resolution, embracing tais iden-
tical inquiry It i« the most direct and parliamentary course,
and will be the most satisfactory
My honorable colleague seems to complain of the power
which these committees exercised m summoning witnesses from
any place they pleased, without regard to distance, as well as
then having issued commissions to take theiestitnony of wit-
nesses whose attendance could not be procured As to the first,
so far as regaids tht committee ovei which 1 preside, I can only
bay that then disci etion was not limited to this District, nor by
specified dis a ices Whenever it had leason to believe there
was a vvi ness whs had knowledge of any Jact which would
have a mateual bearing upon the subject under investigation,
he was either oidpred to be summoned, or authority given to
take his testimony The committee did not perceive that, if
they had power to summon at all, the authority was limned by
any othei boundary than that of the United States itself If there
was any other limitation or restriction, they were not aware of it
Tney legarded it their right, as well as their duty, when they
ascertained that any individual would disclose important facts,
whethei he tesided in Boston New York, New OrleaBS, or
Cnaileston, to summon him I should be under obligations to
my colleagueif he would point out the restuctionas to distance,
if the power exists at all To have harassed our citizens thus,
was an extremely unpleasant duty yet it was necessary These
are duties which oui citizens owe one to another, and which alt
owe to the Government, and which, howevei unpleasant and
hanging must be peifoimed, or the very existence of society
it elf jeoparded As to the second complaint, 1 have only to say
that, if I do not mistecollect, this powei is conferred by act of
Congies-, but whether it beor not, theexerciseof thispower is
sustained I y the ieptated practices of the Government, and I
^hall not dot \m ily House by discussing it The exercise of the
summoning discretion was unifoimly exercised upon the state-
ment of some member of the committee, that he believed the
testimony of the witness proposed to be examined was material
oi necess u y It was not usual, nt r was it propei, to require
members ol the committee to be sworn as to the materiality of
witnesses, they desired to be examm d They had no personal
íritcie&t in tht result of the investigation, they were members of
the investigating body, acting upon their obligations of duty,
and their íespon ibihty to the House and to the country, and
could not, with any decent propuety have been required tobe

The xesolution of my honorable colleague [Mr Hopkins]
pioposed an mquny into a sublet of gtavc and serious import
It piopooet, to inquire into the propriety of so disconnecting the
public printing oí all the blanches of this Government from the
p liticd.1 piess of the country, db to pievent the effect of that
deletenous influence which the dispensation of such an im.
mense mass- of pationaae to the political press is calculated to
produce It cannot be Üoubted that the pnnciple asserted by
thibi«solution iü sound and salutary, and the object piopobed to
he at amed \ aluable Yet I confers I have some doubts whether,
in the present state of the pies , and the long and intimate con-
necti )n which 1 a> existed, and f 10m the failuie of every attempt
heietofoie, such an atta nment is piactiCdhle Enteitaimng
•hese doubts, I shall come to no conclusion as to what will be
my final vote, until I canjee the plan by which it is proposed to
effect this object, that I may be the bettei enabled to judge of its
practicability
Mr Speaker, a pure press, and a / ee pies , is one of the
gieatest blessings which we can enjoy, it is a towei of strength
to the people against the usurpations and corruptions of Go
vemment, and the palladium of then liberty    With a free
pre"s, and a pure p^e^, v utue and morality will ha preserved,
and geneial intelligence so diffused, as to bid defiance to all the
assaul's, however potent, of tyianny and despotism upon the
rights ol the people andj- notwithstanding that much of hcen-
tiousne-s has ei^pt into th° pre** of the present dav, I am, even
foi tin , not prepared m do any single act which would tend to
shacl it its perfect iiecdom, when I do that, I should blow out
the light winch exhibits vm ic and morality m their most en
learnt? and I eauuiul forms  and d lects the wandering foot
stfps of the pilgrim ol liberty to the temple m which it is en

It c mm i, I think be doubted, t^at the purity of the press can be
best pieservt d, and us licentiousness mosteffectually restiained,
by placins it is iai as piaeticable upon its responsibility to an
enlightened ant1 virtuou public opn ion    If it can alone look
to that for countenance  \ud suppoit, it will feelits lesponsi
bill y, confonn us mattei to that standii 1 of moiahty, virtue,
and decency wh'ch pievail within the bounddiy of its. cucula

upon licentiousness    a sound and health} state of public opi
mon is the greateet ^ecuaty which we have foi the decency and
r un y of the pres , and the only i estraint upon us licentious
ne=s which can be successfully interposed    The influence of
the pi ess upon public opinion has been so completely tested by
experience that it would be but an idle expenditure of words
and u eless \ aste of time to attempt to pi ove it     We see it
eveiy wheie, we feel i m every situation but it is only by an
abu e of tint miluence that moiahty, virtue and libeity can be
impaired or hazaided it is onlv when the pvess descends fiom
its tiuiy political m o a puiely paitisanengine, that public opi
