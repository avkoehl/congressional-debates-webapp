Forrest if desired. It seems to me that he should not be allowed to remain where he is, and that the Mobile and Ohio Railroad should be destroyed. Forrest had two regiments watching us opposite Savannah. He may have swung off toward Georgia before now, but the will make great use of the Mobile and Ohio Railroad, and as long as that remains he will greatly annoy both Middle and WEST Tennessee.

JOHNSONVILLE, October 18, 1864.

Major General GEORGE H. THOMAS:

I have 2,700 cavalry and 1,200 infantry and two pieces of artillery. We should have double that force. I will see you this evening.

Major-General.

WASHINGTON, October 20, 1864 3 p. m.

Major-General THOMAS:

It is reported here that Forrest is threatening both Paducah and Memphis. If by the assistance of Burbridge and Washburn you could drive him south it would relieve that part of the country from all danger.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

If you can spare me one of my corps I can with that and the cavalry now in Tennessee effectually drive Forrest south, destroy the railroad, and then return with the corps to the main army.
