and have been confined since that time in Fort Lafayette and Warren, the letter being my presnt place of confinement. Since my arrest suits have been instituted in the courts of New York against me amounting to over $30,000, which amount I have on deposit there and has been there since April 1, 1861. The object of the suits is the confiscation of my property. My object in writing to Your Excellency is that I may be allowed my liberty to attend the said suits upon such terms as you may designate. Although a native of Virginia my property is in New York. I have therefore no desire to go South. I only ask to be permitted to defend my property in suit. Evil-disposed persons, my enemies, are endeavoring to have my property confiscated whils I am here, well knowing were I at liberty they could not accomplish their designs. I am willing to enter into any obligation the Government may require of me.

Hoping this matter will receive your speedy attention I am, with great respect, your obedient servant,

J. K. MILLNER.

FORT WARREN, January 8, 1862.

Hon. W. H. SEWARD, Secretary of State.

DEAR SIR: Having been in confinement now for four months I make a request of you to release me on parole to visit New York on business and I will report myself here at the expiration of my parole or to the U. S. marshal in the city of New York as you may direct.

Hoping you will see proper to comply with my request I remain, your obedient servant,

J. K. MILLNER.

FORT WARREN, January 23, 1862.

Hon. W. H. SEWARD, Secretary of State, Washington, D. C.

SIR: I am now nearly five months in prison. I have during that time made several appeals to you to the end that I might procure my release. I am confident that I have not violated any law at any time, and it is with this feeling that I now persist in urging upon you a speedy trail or a release from prison. Pecuniary circumstances press heavily on me; the toil of years is about to be torn from my grasp, and those whom I thought were my friends would now prefer keeping me here for selfish purposes.

I am willing to accept any terms to procure my release, an oath or a parole, although I think either uncualled for in my case.

Hoping you will consider this in a spirit of conciliation I am, respectfully, your obedient servant,

BETHEL BURTON.

FORT WARREN, January 23, 1862.

Hon. W. H. SEWARD, Secretary of State, Washington, D. C.

DEAR SIR: Will you release me on parole for thirty days to visit New York City upon some private business that needs my personal attention?

Yours respectfully,

J. K. MILLNER.
