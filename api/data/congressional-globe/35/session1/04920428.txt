THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
January 27,
prayer that provision may be made in pursuance
of the prayer of the petition. It has been intrusted
to me, I doubt not, from the fact that Commodore
Parker, although he died at Philadelphia, was a
citizen, and a very valued citizen of Virginia. I
move the reference of the memorial to the Com-
mittee on Naval Affairs.

Mr. PUGH. I present resolutions of the Gen-
eral Assembly of Oluo, relative to the affairs of
the Territory of Kansas. As my colleague wishes
to make some remarks upon tkem, I move that
they he upon the table, and be printed.
Mr. WADE. Mr. President, I do not propose
to make any extended remarks on these very ex-
traordinary resolutions at this or at any time; but
they are extraordinary m their character, incon-
gruous in themselves, and, I fear, not very rep-
utable to the State.
Mr. HALE. Let them be read.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Secretary will
read the resolutions.
The Secretary read them, as follows:
Senate Joint Resolutions relative to Kansas Jljfairs.

CHARLES W. BLAIR,
Clerk of the Senate.
JOHN W. KEES,
Clerk of the House of Representatives.
January 21, 1858.
Mr. WADE. Mr. President, I have said that
I feared these resolutions were not reputable, be-
cause they do not speak out with that manly
independence with which the-Legislature ofasov-
ereign State should ever speak upon any question
sufficiently important to elicit their observation
at all. Why do they go on to indoiso the Presi-
dent, and say they have special confidence in his
Administration, and pledge themselves to support
evei(y jot and tittle of that Adm.nistration, when
they in tend finally to instruct us here to go against
the only great darling measure the Administra-
tion has ever presented? Why could they not
have come directly to the question at issue, and,
with that calm dignity which becomes a sovereign
State, declare and announce their purpose and
their instructions and their will, in reference to
any matter pending here which it became the
duty of their representatives to act upon? Why
declare that they have the fullest confidence in all
its measures, while it was the purpose and end
of their resolutions that with a stern determina-
tion their representatives here shall beard him,
and oppose him to the death on his one great
darling measure ? They are disreputable because
they have not spoken out like men conscious of
their independence.
I did not rise for the purpose of arguing the
reasons that led to their instructing us at all; they
have been argued by others: in my judgment the
question is not a debatable one. I never proposed
to debate it at all. It fs no less than this: The
President, in his message, announces a determin-
ation not only to prohibit the people of a Terri-
tory from making the constitution under which
they are to live, but that it is his purpose to forcc
upon them one made by their enemies and sought
to be crammed down their throats, if necessary,
by Federal bayonets. When such a proposition
as that is made, I leave others to debate it. This
old issue was joined in the Revolution, and the
argument was made on Bunker Hill; and I pro-
pose, if it comes to that, to resume that same ar-
gument where our fathers left it. It will not bear
an argument at all. When any portion of the
American people are so lost to all spirit that they
would for one moment stand off to argue a ques-
tion of this kind, their liberties are not worth pre-
serving. I do not rise to argue such a question
as that; but it was such a question, looming up in
the distance, that attracted the attention of the
Ohio Legislature and led to the making of these
instructions.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator will
suspend his remarks for a moment. The Chair,
under the rule, must announce that the hour has
arrived for the consideration of the special order.
Mr. WADE. I have nothing further to say of
any consequence. I shall not take more than a
few minutes.
The VICE PRESIDENT. By unanimous
consent the Senator will proceed.
Several Senators. "Go on."
Mr. WADE. Mr. President, bowing thw proud
head of a sovereign State, they descend to speak
of party platforms, to which they show their de-
votion. I should not have alluded to party policy
m connection with the acts of a sovereign State,
if these resolutions had not introduced the sub-
ject. Why, sir, did they step aside from their
legitimate business, to remdoiso what they call
"the Cincinnati platform?" Is that in accord-
ance with the dignity of a sovereign State, when
she.undertakes to instruct her Representatives
and Senators in relation to their duty hcie?
They show their devotion, too. to the Execu-
tive! Why, sir, if he shall persist in what they
intimate is his purpose and intention, he is a ty-
rant, and deserves the frowns and reprobation of
! every man. _ They tell us that they have the utmost
! confidence in the Executive, and that they will
[ adheie to all his measures; yet, m the next place,
j they tell us that what he i's attempting to do is
, unfortunate; that it tends to a bleach of the pcace,
and to stir up civil war. They do not lose their
i confidence in him; they say they ha\e the most
J perfect confidence m his ability and his integrity;
| that they adhere to all his measures; and then
' they instruct us to throw his message in his face.
! I am ready to do it, sir. [Laughter.] Unfortu-
: nate, indeed, it was that the attempt was made to
| frame a constitution behind the back of a people,
1 and to fasten it on their necks without their assent.
; They say that this was " unfoituate;" and that
it is "unfortunate," also, in the President to
, announce it as his purpose to carry out the fraud-
ulent design. Yes, sir, it was exceedingly " un-
fortunate." Was it not a little worse than un-
fortunate, if the President of the United States is
responsible ? I do not know that he is considered
