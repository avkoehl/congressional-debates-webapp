AUGUSTA, August 6, 1864.

Colonel J. B. SALE:

Just arrived after much difficulty. Found the repairs on Georgia Central Railroad progressing slowly and unsatisfactorily. Gave such orders as ought to expedite them. The command should be transferred to Hood's department. He is now embarrassed for want of ammunition, which I shall force through from here. The unfortunate withdrawal of the guard to Savannah a few hours before the raiding party arrived, caused the loss of the Oconee bridge, burned by only fifty men. I shall leave for Charleston this evening or to-morrow morning, thence to Richmond, unless otherwise ordered. Have no dispatches for over a week.

AUGUSTA, August 6, 1864.

Colonel J. B. SALE:

The newspapers announced the exchange of Major General Frank Gardner at Charleston. He should go to Hood immediately to replace Stewart or Loring, now disabled by wounds. The corps needs a commander badly.
