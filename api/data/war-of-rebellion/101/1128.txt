Brigadier-General CARLETON,

Santa Fe, N. Mex.:

GENERAL: The Secretary of War directs me to say, in reply to your letter of January 29, that you will arrest and have tried all persons engaged in unlawful trading with hostile Indians or supplying them with arms and ammunition. Citizens and Indian agents may be tried by military commissions. Before executing sentence the proceedings in such cases should be sent to the War Department for approval. On the 31st of December General Crocker was directed too report in person to the commanding officer of Department of the Cumberland. If the order has been miscarried please repeat it, as General Crocker's services are required by General Grant.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
