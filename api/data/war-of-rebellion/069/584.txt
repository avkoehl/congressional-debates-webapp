are following. Prisoners report their loss as considerable. Shall I change the position of my main force, and, if so, in what direction? I go to General Warren's headquarters at once, and I will report result of consultation.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, June 4, 1864-7.30 a. m.

Your telegram announcing withdrawal of enemy from your front received. I am awaiting your report as to the extent of this withdrawal and the amount of your line relieved, to give necessary orders.

GEO. G. MEADE,Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, June 4, 1864-7.30 a. m.

General BURNSIDE:

Your dispatch of 6.35 a. m. is received. General Warren is ordered to contract his lines to the left as far as practicable and relieve General Birney. The major-general commanding directs that you move to the left and occupy as much of the ground vacated by General Warren as may be necessary, retaining at the same time some part of your command in reserve, available for supports.

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS, June 4, 1864-8 a. m.

Major-General BURNSIDE, Commanding Ninth Army Corps:

GENERAL: Major-General Warren directs me to say that he has been ordered to contract his lines to the left as far as practicable. He requests that you inform him as soon as you are ready to move to your left and he will relieve the right brigade of your First Division.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,A. S. MARVIN, Jr.,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS, June 4, 1864-11.10 a. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS, Chief of Staff:

I have seen the dispatch from General Smith,* and would state that I have just ordered troops from the Ninth Corps in to relieve General Griffin. This will enable Warren, I think, to relieve General Birney at once.

Major-General.
