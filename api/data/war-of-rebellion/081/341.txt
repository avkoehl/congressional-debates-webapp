HEADQUARTERS SIXTH ARMY CORPS,June 23, 1864-4 p.m.

Major-General BIRNEY:

The enemy drove off the small force I had on the railroad, displaying two lines of battle of perhaps two regiments from and a skirmish line. Other troops are reported to have advanced on their left, and still others to have crossed the railroad, but not as moving in this direction. All this may mean an attack on me or it may be a development of their line to their right. No signs of a movement on your front. I have stopped the movement of the right of my main line forward till matters become quiet.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General, Commanding.

Commanding Second Corps:

I have just sent a staff officer in haste asking you to send two brigades as soon as you can. If you can spare more, please send by same route. I am much obliged for your kind offer.

Lieutenant-Colonel WALKER,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: I have the honor to report that my skirmish line was advanced through the woods to the edge of the open field, some mile from my line of battle. The enemy's works are in the field, manned. They are as full of troops as they can be got. We are in advance of the lines on our right and left, but are trying to establish our connections. We cannot advance farther with a skirmish line or without coming upon the enemy's works.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

FRANCIS C. BARLOW,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Division.

P. S.-The skirmish line is in advance of the position held by my line of battle yesterday.

FRANCIS C. BARLOW,

Brigadier-General.
