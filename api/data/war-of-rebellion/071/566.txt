HAGERSTOWN, August 1, 1864.

Brigadier General W. W. AVERELL:

I have been from Falling Waters to Williamsport. I crossed the river at Williamsport, and went two miles on Virginia side. Came across the rebel camp. They destroyed their camp this morning at 10 o'clock and took the dirt road to Hedgesville. Information from citizens on that side of river say they have gone toward Cumberland. The only rebels on this side are a few horse-thieves prowling around this section of country. I shall remain here until further orders.
