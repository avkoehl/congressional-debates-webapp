H. L. D. LEWIS,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General:

Scouts just in report five regiments of enemy's infantry, with small body cavalry, eight miles this side of Pensacola at 12 o'clock yesterday; have sent down two regiment to meet them, if still advancing.

C. G. ARMISTEAD,

Colonel, Commanding.

COLONEL: If the reports from Colonel Armistead are true it looks as if the enemy designs carrying our his original intentions of going toward Selma, whilst the demonstrations immediately around us may possibly be intended for effect, to conceal from us his real object. Dannelly's Mills is about fifteen miles southeast from Montrose, and about twenty-seven from Blakely. I have no later report from Greenwood regarding enemy's force on Camp Withers road. Colonel Spence will inform me as soon as he gets in front of the enemy at Dannelly's Mills.
