The House then proceeded to consider the
GOLD COINAGE BILL
Mr WHITE, of New York, moved to strike
out all after the enacting clause of the bill, and to
insert a substitute, which was read
Mr BINNEY remarked, that he understood the
pi oposal to dispense altogether with the subsidiary
coins, to enhance the value of gold, in relation to
silver, to the proportion of one to sixteen
I     Mr  WHITE assented, and entered into a de-
tailed explanation of the principles, and provisions
of the amendment
j     Mr SELDEN moved to amend the amendment,
I so as to establish the value of gold, in relation to
I silver, at the rate of one to fifteen and five eighths,
83 originally proposed by the committee    Mr S
| spoke at great length in support of his proposi-
tion
The discussion was<urther continued by Messrs.
CLOWNEY, GORHAM, JONES of Georgia,
GILLET, BINNEY, EW1NG, CAMBRE-
LENG, McKIM, REED, and SELDEN, when
the question was stated on Mr SELDEN'S
amendment to the amendment, and it was nega-
tived—yeas 52, nays 127
Mr GORHAM moved so to amend the amend-
ment, as to make the proportion betweengold and
silver 15 82") to 1, instead of 16 to 1, as contem-
plated by the amendment
This proposition was negatived—yeas 69, nays
112
Mr BINNEY inquired whether there was a
similar clause in this bill so securing the accuracy
of the coinage as was contained in the present law.
Mr WHITE presumed that the present law on
that subject would reach the coinage proposed by
the bill
Mr BINNEY read the provision of the law,
and pi esented a con espondent section to be added
to this bill, which was accepted by Mr WHITE
as a modification
The amendment, as modified, was then agreed
to without a division
The bill, as amended, having been engrossed,
was read a third time, and the question stated on
its passage
Mr WILDE demanded the yeas and nays,
which weie oidered
Messrs ADAMS, ARCHER,and GORHAM,
assigned the reasons why they should vote in fa-
vor of the bill, though not perfectly satisfied with
the proportion fixed by it, and Messrs ELLS-
WORTH and WILDE each made a remark as to
the grounds of their voting against it
