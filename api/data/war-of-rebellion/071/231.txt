Major-General.

NEAR FORT SARATOGA, D. C.,

July 12, 1864-7. 50 a. m.

Major-General AUGUR:

Only about 600 of the Nineteenth Corps have reported. I put these in the rifle-pits about 3 o'clock this morning and took them out about 7. I want an adjutant-general; can one be assigned to me? I propose to establish the camp for my command near the old Bladensburg road, so as to be convenient to the forts from Bunker Hill to Lincoln, provided this disposition meets your views. Please bear in mind the assistant adjutant-general.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Q. A. GILLMORE,

Major-General.

Major-General GILLMORE,

Commanding Nineteenth Corps:

You will aid any one in your vicinity who may be attacked and requires it. General Meigs has command of all his employes, and is using them wherever their services are required. No more of the Nineteenth Corps have arrived. The sailors, &amp;c., are under the command of Rear-Admiral Goldsborough. You will please assign them a position at or near Fort Lincoln where they are most required. The axes and spades will be furnished by the engineer department as soon as possible.

Respectfully, yours,

C. C. AUGUR,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers.
