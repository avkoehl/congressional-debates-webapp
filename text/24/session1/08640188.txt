never to see any city in these United States sus-
tain to them the relat.on Pans sustains to France.
God forbid that New York should ever become
what the advocates of tins measure have denom-
inated it —the same to our political system which
the heart i<" to the corporeal system '
We have heard much, Mr.'Chairman, from a
certain quarter, though not from Massachusetts,
about a moneyed corporation wielding danj^crous
power* that were likely to overshadow the liber-
ties of the people. 1 should be pleased to know
whether £"ntlem n who were, in gone-by days,
si sens.mo about moneyed influences, are now
to be found anion  the number who are edmon-
lshing the \Ve«t to mark well their course on
this subf*ct,aiid see that thev do not run counter
to the interests of their constituents. We have
been told that \ew York has acted the part of a
kind, fond, indulgent, and confiding mother to
the cities and Milages of the West I do not
wish, sir, to create any sectional jealousies upon
this or any other subject that comes before this
House; for I consider it an improper mode of
legislation- but I will barely remark that, whilst
I have learned there is mucii of enterprise, indus-
try, and prudent financiering in the New York
character, I had not read so far into their history
as to ascertain that they were in the habit of
extending their kindness and indulgence much
further than the dictates of interest misht chance
to sus~ st. I suppose the merchants of New
York~ occasionally extend time to their western
customers after their obligations fall due; but
1 have not within my recollection heard them
charged with refusing a little interest by way of
indemnity for the forbearance. And we in the
West say to the merchants of New York: If it
be inconvenient to pay your bonds when they fall
due, it is but just you should pay interest for the
indulgence.
The gentleman from Massachusetts, as an ad-
ditional reason why this bill should pass, brings
to the view of the House the immense loss which
the fire has caused to New York; he has told us
'jo set down the destruction of goods and build-
tigs at $25,000,000, (which I think exceeds by
f8,000,000 any previous estimate I have heard,)
and to that add the amount of credit that such a
Bum would g ve merchants of good character, and
also the amount of profit that such a capital
would reasonably have yielded merchants well
established in business, and the additional loss
consequent on the destruction of their account-
books and papers, and the amount would be as-
tounding. I agree that the loss to New York has
been immense; but it would Tery much puzzle
the gentleman from Massachusetts, learned and
eble aa all admit him to be, to demonstrate to the
satisfaction of an impartial judge, that New York
can sustain herself under such a loss, amounting,
if his calculations be not magnified, to at least
$100,000,000', and yet be unable to meet the de-
mands of the Government to the amount of be-
tween three and four millions. If they can main-
tain their credit unimpaired under all these losses;
if, as it seems to be admitted on all hands, not a
failure has occurred so far among all the Govern-
ment debtors, it seems to me that gentlemen who
have warned us to pass this bill, or great losses
must be incurred by the Government from the
failure of these merchants, are rather disposed to
deal in fancy, more than in reasonable calcula-
tions, predicated upon probabilities.
The gentleman from Massachusetts has felt
irmself called on to give the gentleman from
Rhode island [Mr. Peirce] a gentle rebuke for
the course he has seen proper to adopt upon this
subject. He seems to think the effort of that gen-
tleman, in proposing an amendment to the bill,
was intended to excite in other classes a preju-
dice against that class of the community for whose
relief it waa intended. Now, sir, whilst I trust
I shall ever be the last man on this floor or else-
where to say ordo anything with a view of excit-
ing the mechanic or farmer against the merchant,
or any one portion of the community against
other portions engaged in different pursuits, (for
I consider they are all necessary to make up a
prosperous community, and are dependent on
each other for their prosperity,) I do most hon-
estly accord in opinion with that gentleman that,
instead of bestowing our charity on importing
merchants who are untouched by the fire, we
could, with much more propriety, if we had the
constitutional power to dispense charity to any,
extend it in the present instance to the helpless
widows and starving orphans, whose whole means
of subsistence, vested in the insurance offices, as
the only stocks in which their limited resources
would yield them a support, were in one night
swept from existence, and they thrown fatherless,
friendless, and penniless upon the cold chanties
of the world.
EXPURGATION OP THE JOURNAL.
SPEECH OF HON. T. H. BENTON,
OF MISSOURI,
In the Senate, March 13, 1S36.
The following preamble and resolution, sub-
mitted by himself on the 17th, having been read:
Whereas, on the 26th day of December, in the > ear 1833,
flie following resolve was moved in the Senate :
" Hetolreé, That, by dismissing the late Secretary of the
Treasury because he would nut, contrary to his own sense
of duty, remove the money of the United Slates in deposit
with the Bank of the United States and its branches, in
conformity with the President's opinion, and bv appointing
bis successor to effect such removal, which has been done,
the President has assumed the exercise of a power over
the Treasury of the United States not granted him t>\ the
Constitution and Ian , and dangerous to the liberties of the
people ;"
Which proposed resolve was altered and changed by the
mover thereof on the 28th day of March, in the year 1834,
so a* to read as follow .
" R*,olred, That in taking upon himself the responsibility
of removing the deposit of the public money from the Bank
of the United States, the President of the United State*
has assumed the exercise of a power over the Treasury of
Uie United States not granted to lain by the Constitution
and Ian s, and dangerous to the liberties of the people,''
Which resolve, so changed and modified by the mover
thereof, on the same day and year last mentioned, was
lurther altered so as to read in these word :
" Resolved, That the President in the late executive pro-
ceedings in relauon to the revenue, has assumed upon
himsett authority and power not conterred by the Cou u-
tution and laws, but in derogation of both ;"
In which last mentioned form the said resolve, on the
same day and year last mentioned, was adopted by the
Senate, and became the act and judgment of that body;
aud, as such, now remains upon the Journal thereof:
And whereas, the said resolve was irregularly, illegally,
and unconstitutionally adopted by the Senate, in violation
of the rights of defense which belong to every citizen, and
in subversion of the fundamental principles of law and jus-
tice ; kecause President Jackson was thereby adjudged Mid
pronounced to be guilty of an impeachable offense., and a
stigma placed upon him as a violator of his oath of office,
and of the laws and Constitution which he was sworn to
preserve, protect, and defend, trnthout going through the
forms of an impeachment, and without allowing to him
the benefits of a trial, or the means of defense:
And whereas, the said resolve, in all its various shapes
and forms, was unfounded and erroneous in point of fact,
and, therefore, unjust and unrighteous, as well as irregular
and unconstituuonal; because the said President Jackson,
neither in the act of dismissing Mr. Duane, nor in the ap-
pointment of Mr Taney, as specified in the first form of the
resolve, nor in taking upon himself the responsibility of
removing the deposits, as specified in the Becond form of
the same resolve, nor in any act which was then, or can
now, be specified under the vague and ambiguous terms
of the general denuneiation contained in the third and last
form ol the resolve, did do or commit any act in violation
or in derogation of the laws and Consütution, or dangerous
to the liberties of the people :
And whereas the said resolve, as adopted, was uncertain
and ambiguous, containing nothing but a loose and floating
charge for derogating from the laws and Constitution, and
assuming ungranted power and authority in the late exec-
utive proceedings in relation to the public revenue, wttkout
specifying whit part of the executive proceedings, or what
part of the public revenue, was intended to be referred to,
or what parts of the laws and Constitution were supposed to
have been infringed, or in what part of the Union, or at
what period of his Administration, these late proceedings
were supposed to have taken place: Therefiy putting each
Senator at liberty to vote in favor of the resolve upon a sep-
arate and secret reason of his own, and leaving the ground
of the Senate's judgment to be guessed at by the public,
and to be differently and diversely interpreted by individual
Senators according to the private and particular under-
standing of each: Contrary to all the ends of justice, and
to all the forms of legal and judicial proceeding—to the
great prejudice of the accused, who could not know against
what to defend himself, and to the loss of senatorial re-
sponsibility, by shielding Senators from public aecountabihty
for making up a judgment upon grounds «Inch the public
cannot know, and which, if known, might prove to he in-
suthcient in law, or unfounded in fuct:
And whereas the specifications contained in the first and
second forms of the resolve having b 'en objected to in de-
bate, and shown to be insufficient to sustain the charges
they were adduced to support, and it being well believed
tuat no majority could be obtained to vote for the said spe-
cifications, and the same having been actually withdrawn
by the mover in the face of the whole Senate, in conse-
quence of such objection and belief, and before any vote
taken thereupon, the said specifications could not after-
wards be nduutted by any rule of parliamentary practice or
by any principle of legal implication, secret intendment,' or
mental re-enatnm, to rerrain nnd continue a part of the
written and public resolve from which they were thus with-
drawn ¡ nnd if they could be so admitted Ihey would not be
sufficient to sustituí the charges therein contained
And whereas the Senate being Unconstitutional tribunal
for the trial of the President when charged by the House of
Representatives with offenses against the laws and the
Constitution, the adoption of the stud resolve before any
iiii|H>achiiieiit was prelerred by the House, was a breach
of the privileges of the [louse, a violation of the Constitu-
tion, a subversion of justice, a prejudication of a question
whu h might legally come before the Senate, and a disquali-
fication ot that bodv to perform its constitutional duty with
fairness and impartiality, if the President should thereafter
he regularly impeached by the House of Representatives
for the same offense •
And whereas the temperite, respectful, and argumenta-
tive defense and protest ot the President against the afore-
said proceedings of the Senate, was rejected and repulsed
by that body, and was voted to be a breach of its privileges,
and was not permitted to be enteied on its Journal, or
pnnted among its documents, while all memorials, peti-
tions, resolves, and ren.onstrances against the President,
however violent or unfounded, and calculated to inflame
the people against him, w ere duly and honorably received,
encomiaslieally commented upon in speeches, read at the
table, ordered to be printed with the long list of names
attached, referred to the Finance Committee forconsidera-
Uon, filed away among the public archives, and now con-
stitute a part of the public documents of the Senate, to be
handed down to the latest posterity:
And whereas the said resolve was introduced, debated,
and adopted, at a time, and under circumstances winch had
the eflect ol cooperating with the Bank of the United States
in the parricidal attempt winch that institution was then
making to produce a panic and pressure in the country, to
destroy the confidence of the people in President Jackson,
to paralvze his administration, to govern the elections, to
bankrupt the State banks, ruin their currency, fill the whole
Union with terror and distress, and thereby to extort from
the sufferings and alarms of the people the restoration of
the deposits and the renewal of its charter:
And whereas the said resolve is of evil example and dan-
gerous precedent, and should never have been received,
debated, or adopted bv the Senate, or admitted to entry
upon its Journal: Wherefore,
Resolved, That the said resolve be expunged from the
Journal; and for that purpose, that the Secretary ot the
Senate, at such time as the Senate may appoint, shall bring
the manuscript journal of the session 1833-34, into the
Senate, and in presence of the Senate, draw black lines
round the said resolve,and write across the face thereof, in
strong letters, the following words: " Expunged bv order
or TiiF Senate, this-----day or-----, in the vear of
our Lord 1836."
Mr. BENTON rose and said: Mr. President,
I comply with my promise, and I presume with
the general expectation of the Senate and of the
people, in bringing forward, at the fiist day that
the Senate is full, and every State completely
represented, my long intended motion to expunge
from the Journal of the Semite, the sentence of
condemnation, which was pronounced against
President Jackson at the session of 1833-34. I
have given to my motion a more extended basis,
and a more detailed and comprehensive form,
than it wore at its first introduction; and I have
done so for two reasons—first, that all the pro-
ceedings against President Jackson might be set
out together, and exhibited to the public at one
view; secondly, that ourown reasons for impugn-
ing that act of the Senate should also be set out,
and fully submitted to the examination and scru-
tiny of the people. The first is due to the Senate,
that all its proceedings in this novel and mo-
mentous case should be fully known; the second
is due to the impugners of their conduct, that it
may be seen now, and in all time to come, that
law and justice, and not the factious impulsions
of party spirit, have governed our conduct:
It has been seen by the reading of my resolu-
tion that I have reinstated and adhere to the word
"expunge." At the last session of the Senate,
I gave way to the entreaties of friends, and sur-
rendered that word, but I had no sooner made
the surrender than I had reason to repent of my
complaisance, and to revoke my concession. I
repented and revoked in the face of the Senate. I
have since examined and considered the objec-
tion with all the care which was due to the gravity
of the subject, and with all the deference which was
due to the dissent of friends; and upon this full
and renewed consideration, I remain firmly con-
vinced of the propriety of the phrase, and of the
justice of the remedy which it implies; and being
so convinced, it becomes my duty to present it
over again to the Senate, and to submit the decis-
ion to their judgment.
It is also seen that the resolution prescribes a
mode of expunging which avoids a total oblitera-
