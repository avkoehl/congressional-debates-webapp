Owing to the fact that my command is now in line of battle, and an official report is called for without delay, I am unable to make it as full and complete as I would under more favorable circumstances be pleased to do.

I cannot, however, close this report without expressing my obligations to the members of my staff-Captain C. P. Neilson and Captain W. G. Poindexter, Lieutenants. A. N. Parker and W. G. Sykes-for the promptness and rapidity with which they bore my dispatches to different parts of the field and executed all orders.

I am, major, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. S. FEATHERSTON,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Major HENRY ROBINSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Loring's Division.
