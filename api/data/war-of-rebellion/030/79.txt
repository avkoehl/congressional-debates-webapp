report given by Bragg's aide, goes the order way. He says Lee telegraphs Bragg to hold Middle Tennessee at all hazards, and Kirby Smith is to go back into Kentucky to divide our forces. He has left Knoxville, I believe. What have you heard from him?

ROSECRANS,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE OHIO,Cincinnati, Ohio, November 21, 1862.

Brig. General J. T. BOYLE, Louisville, Ky:

Your proposition to put Colonel Bruce in command at Bowling Green is approved, if you have a good commander for the force at Russellville. General Rosecrans telegraphs that, as hospital accommodations were wanted at Russellville, he authorized Colonel Bristow to take the hotel and house of a rebel Congressman, and that Gray's hotel was taken by Colonel Shackelford, but that Colonel Bruce arriving, ordered him to evacuate the hotel. Direct Colonel Bruce to countermand his order, and report his reason for giving it.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE OHIO,Cincinnati, Ohio, November 21, 1862.

Major-General W. S. ROSECRANS,

Nashville, Tenn.:

I have directed that the order of Colonel Bruce, in regard to the hotel at Russellville, be at once countermanded by him, and that he report his reasons for giving it. I had assigned to General Boyle a district including the railroad and the part of the State lying west, and as General Paine ranks him, his assignment to the district would give him the command, which would not suit. Bruce takes command at Bowling Green, where he has been before. He is well spoken of.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE OHIO,Cincinnati, Ohio, November 21, 1862.

Major-General GORDON GRANGER, Lexington, Ky.:

Boyle telegraphs that he has advised you of a body of 3,000 rebel cavalry, supported by infantry, being yesterday at Barboursville. What do you know about it? You must see that they don't pass you toward the railroad. Answer.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General, Commanding.

LEXINGTON, KY., November 21, 1862.

Major-General WRIGHT, Cincinnati, Ohio:

I have no information of any rebels being this side of Cumberland Gap, but will endeavor to give them the best reception we can afford in case they come. Have no confidence in the report.

G. GRANGER,

Major-General, Commanding.
