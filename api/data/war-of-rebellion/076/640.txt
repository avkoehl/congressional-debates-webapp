General THOMAS:

Inasmuch as we have postponed our movement till Thursday night I think it would be well for General Garrard to send out the brigade that did not go with General Kilpatrick out to Stone Mountain to-morrow, and let it break up another five miles of road to make a sure think of that road.

HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI, In the Field, near Atlanta, August 23, 1864-7.30 p. m.

General THOMAS:

Have your signal corps provided with rockets, and agree upon signals by rockets or signal smoke for a few simple message such as "All well," "Send boats to Campbellton," "Send a brigade, division, or regiment to Campbellton," also "Look out for us at Roswell." These signals may be of use to us when we get beyond safe distance for couriers via Sandtown.
