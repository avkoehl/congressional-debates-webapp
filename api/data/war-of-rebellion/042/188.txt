confined him to communicate fully to General Bankhead only. I did not press him, but sent him immediately on to General B. Enough, however, was elicited to make it certain that a deplorable condition of affairs exists in the counties named and probably in some adjoining ones.

I inclose also copy of statement of all arms at this post.* Most of these are unfit for use. Many can never be rendered serviceable. They were sent forward, General Bankhead informed me, to arm Terrell's regiment, 593 in all; not enough, you will perceive, for a regiment if all were serviceable.

The State troops are entirely without arms, and if in an emergency I have to send five companies forward to re-enforce General Bankhead, I shall be compelled to arm them from the guns at this post. If a few stand of arms could be sent to his command, they would be of great benefit.

Hoping my acts may meet the approval of the major-general commanding, I remain, captain, respectfully, yours,

SAM'L A. ROBERTS,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding Northern Sub-District, Texas.

HEADQUARTERS TRANS-MISSISSIPPI DEPARTMENT,Shreveport, La., August 30, 1863.

Major General J. B. MAGRUDER,

Commanding District of Texas, &c.:

GENERAL: The authority asked for in your letter of the 21st of July to send an agent to Mexico is given.

As Mr. Superviele has displayed so much diplomatic ability in the matter lately intrusted to him, I suggest him as a proper person to be charged with his duty. He should be furnished with the necessary proofs to establish our claim to the arms seized in the Goodyear, and be sent forward at once.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. KIRBY SMITH,

Lieutenant-General.
