but will submit to the decision of the House m both cases

Very respectfully, your obedient serv int,
GEO   W  JONES
Hon James K Polk,
Speaker oj the House of Representatues
The SPEAKER, with the permission of the
Hou«.e, made a brief explanation of the course of
the Sergcant-at-Arms and the Presiding Officer
of the House
By the Journal of the extra session, at the
opening of the present Congiess in September,
1837, it appeared that " George Wallace Jones
appeared as the Delegate from the Territory of
Wisconsin, was swoin to support the Constitu-
tion of the United States, and took a seat in the
House." No certificates of election of members
or Delegates were presented at the time of quah
fication, and the Speaker could not know under
what authonty they took their seats Mr Jones
was sworn, and took a seat
At the commencement of the present session,
Mr. Jones appeared in his sett, claiming to be
the rightful  sitting  Delegate  from  Wisconsin
When the claim of Mr Doty was presented, Mi
Jones rose in his place and asserted hisnght
The House, by its acquiescence, ieeogni7ed him
as the sitting Delegate, and took ordei m the case,
by referring the claim  to a scat as the Di legate
fiom Wisconsin to the Committee of LUctions
Mr Jones continued in his seat as the sitting
Delegate     He, at vanous times, as the Journal
shows, presented petitions and resolutions, and
paiticipattd in the business of the House, as the
sitting Delegate     This was permitted by the ac
quiescence of the House, until the light to the
seat was decided by the House     Whilst Mi
Jones was thus the sitting Delegate, in his seat,
in discharge of his duties as such, the Sergeant-
at-Atms or the Picsiding Officer had no light 01
power to mquiie whether he was rightfully theie
f hat was a question which the House alone could
di cide     The law legulating the pay of ni( mbers
and Delegates, for aught that appealed of lcioid,
entitled him to his compensation until tin time he
wasousttd by a vote of tlu Ilomi      Hi called
for his tompt nsation, and noithti tlit   Stigmnt
at-Aims 01 the Sptakcrhutl any dist i< tioii to n
fuse it undti  tin I iw      Tin  ilicckfoi  his com
pensation was madi out in tin usual way, by the
Soigcant at Anns,  and   signed  inula   the   law
Since taking tin cluui this morning, a It Ui i liom
Mr Joins had bien laid on his tabh      And now
the question of compaisatitm, undei  the lcsolu
tion Before the House, was an open out,     Thi
House alone can, by its oulet, lefusc the < ompi n
sation     Undei tin law, the Seigi antand Speak i
cannot     i he Spe ilea  c\piissitl the  hope that
the House would deride tlit. question, and thus
ltliovc the subject fiom all doubt and cmbarrass-
m< nt
A long debate then ensued, in which the res
olution wis advocated by VIcssis MASON of
Ohio, and Gl DOINGS and opposed by Messrs
