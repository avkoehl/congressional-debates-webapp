Mr. WILLIAMS. I move that the commit-
tee now rise. We have had read all but one
section of the bill; but that is a very pregnant
section. I notice that it proposes to repeal no
less than twenty-six sections of the old law.
Now we ought to ascertain what those sections
are. And I think there are other sections
which should be repealed. I therfore move that
the committee rise.
Mr. WILSON, of Iowa. I hope that motion
will be agreed to. It cannot be expected that
we can report this bill to the House to-night.
Mr. CONKLING. It is hot expected fliat
we will report the bill. But I hope the remain-
ing section will be read; and then the bill can
be left in committee until to-morrow.
Mr. HILL. Will ths bill then be open to
amendment?
The CHAIRMAN. If the last section is now
read, that section will be open to amendment,
and the bill will also be open to amendment by
way of additional sections; but it will not be
in order to return to any other section for
amendment except by unanimous consent.
Mr. WILLIAMS. I withdraw my motion
that the committee rise.
No amendment being offered,
The Clerk read as follows :
Sec. 46. Andbeitfurther enacted, That sectionssixfcy
and one hundred andfourteen of theact entitled "An

four, forty-five, and sixty-one of the act amendatory
thereof, approved July IS, 1866, be, and the same are
hereby, repealed.
Mr. WILLIAMS. I move to amend the
first line of this section by inserting after the
word "sixty" the word "ninety-seven."
Pending this amendment,
Mr. HOOPER, of Massachusetts, moved
that the committee rise.
The motion was agreed to. f
So the committee rose; and the Speaker

ported that the Committee of the Whole on the

revenue, and had directed him to report that
they had come to no resolution thereon.
