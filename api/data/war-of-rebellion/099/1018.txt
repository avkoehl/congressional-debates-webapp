RICHMOND, VA., January 17, 1865.

Governor A. G. MAGRATH,

Charleston, S. C.:

Yours of the 15th received to-day. I had no information of the withdrawal of troops by General Bragg. Will communicate with General Lee, who commands department including Wilmington. Major-General Butler's division was directed to proceed as rapidly as possible to South Carolina. General Hampton has, I suppose, gone also. General Beauregard is at headquarters of Hood's army, with orders to bring all the troops which can be spared and resume control of operations against Sherman. I am fully alive to the importance of successful resistance to Sherman's advance, and have called on the governor of Georgia to give all the aid he can furnish. Had you not better correspond with him on that point?

JEFF'N DAVIS.
