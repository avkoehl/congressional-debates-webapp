to be made m the due north line from the monument at the head
of the St Croix, and if no such highlands should be found m
thatmeiidian, the search to be then continued to the westward
thereof Indeed1 why not also to the eastward thereof? But
iarther as a matter of opinion,
1 In urdei to avoid all fruitless disputes as to the ch&iacter of
such highlands, the commissioners should be instructed to look
for highlands which both parties might acknowledge as ful
filling th*1 conditions of the treaty "
Is thzs one of the "modifications" forming a part of the basis'*
Tf so, and if the commission is to "be constituted accordingly,
surrender the subject—abandon the whole question at once—
give up—the territory toill be theus, 'In order to avoid all
fruitless disputes " We once agreed to the northwest angle of
Nova Scotia, in ordei to avoid disputes, but, "in order te avoid
all fruitier deputes as to the character of such highlands, the
commissioners should be instructed to look for highlands which
both parties might acknowledge as fulfilling the conditions of
the treaty " This is one of "the modifications of her Majesty's
Government ' What is th*1 consequence of if* Let us iedu.ee
it to practice The commissioners will commence operations,
foi example, let ussuppose, at the head of Connecticut river
Th<.y inn along veiy quietly and amicably, eastwardly, on
highlardswh c ibotn parties acknowledge, a considenble dip
tance, till they amve somewheie in the longitude of Quebec,
westward of the sources of the St John's, and the Biitish com
mi^sioners say, "¡so fiu wehave gone upon dividing highlands "
''Certainly," is the i eplv llhei e we agree the treaty highlands
ru^tJ ' We do " l Very well these highlands continue no
farthei, the other rivers flowing southward are not Atlantic
lively We can agree no farther, and now we mu t run a
straight line to the monument " Ifweaie coming into any
such league as this, I say agam, abandon the terntoiy at once,
openly and boldly Why seek for any covert means of sun en
deiing ul
But, sir I need not spend time m showing the uttei useless
ness of the proposed commission, subject to the "modifications
of her Majesty's Government " The Secretary of fe ate has
\ ery fully and very clearly pei foimed that labor already In
his reply, dated Februaiy 7th, othelettei of Januaiy 10th of
the ButishMimslei, he «peaks of
"Tae distinctive difieience between the American proposal
for the appointment of ^uch a commission, and the same pro
po&ition when modified to meet the wishes of her Majesty s
Government "
And farther
'The American proposition is intended—and if agreed to,
would doubtl ss be successful - o decide the question of bntm
daiy definitively by the adoption of the highlands reported by
tne commissioners of survey, and would thus sect) e the ti eat y
line The Bnti h modification looks to no such object It
merely contemphtes-i commission of boundary analogous to
that appointed under the fifth article of the treaty of Ghent, and
would, in all probability, prove equally unsatisfactory in prac
tice "
Agam
1 The modification of the American proposition was, as un
deistood by the undersigned, so fundamentally important that
it e?itn ely chang°d iti> nature "
(And in c mclu ion remarked
The undu signed, m conclusion, is instructed to mfoim M-
Fox that, if anegotiatmn be enter'ained at all upon the incon
elusive md unsa is actory basis aflouled by the Butish counter
prop sition or substitute, which possesses hardlv a, leature in
com man with the Americ n proposition, the Piesic'ent will
n >t venture to invite it un ess the authorities of the Siate of
Mame to wl om, as before stated, if will benithwnh submitted,
bhall think it more likely to lead to a final adjustment of the
q íestion of boundary, than the General Government deems
it to be, though predisposed to see it in the most favorable
Such is the original Amencar proposition, with "the modín
cations offered by her Majesty's Government " ' Inconclusive
and unsatisfactory"—entuely changing the nature of the propo
sition—a substitute for it— "looking to no such object" as an ul
tímate decision of the treaty line Lut a meie commission of
exploration and observation and acquisition of topogiaphical
knowledge such purpose*, diid t>uch a commission, on the
7th of February last, thi^ Govemmbnt expressly repudiated
It is now voluntarily proffeied and invited Why the change?
What has induced it7 The becretaiy «aye it is ' in accordance
with the expressed wishes of the Legislature of Maine "
Wbeie is the evidence of thisl On the first of Maich last,
Mr Forsyth, m a letter to Governor Kent communicated
very fully, and candidly, and satisfactorily, the hi^toiy o! the
negouatioi upon the subject of the boundaiy tosothei with a
¡ucid statement of the piesent condition of the subject, wuh a
view of draw ing the attention of the State to the emergency in
which we are now placed, and mvitmgits advice andacqm
escence m regard to measures contemplated by the Executive
of the United States Ihe Governor in a very cleat droinc ,
and comprehensive message, transmitted the whole mattci to
the Legislature, which nnally adopted several resolutions,
fsunued upon the letter of the Secretary and the message of the
Goyemor, the thud of which is in these words
"Resolved, That our Senators and Itepresentaüves in Con
gress be requested to urge the passage of the bill for the survey
of the Northeastern boundary of the United Statts, <fee now
pending in Congress, and that if said bill shall not become a
law dining the present session of Congress, and if the Govern-
ment of the United State", either alone or m conjunction with
Great Bntain or the State of Maine shall not, on or before the
fint day of Septembev next, establish and appomta commission
for a survev of said boundary line, it shall then be the impera
Uve duty of the Governor, without fuither delay, to appoint
forthwith suitable commissioner* and surveyors for ascertaining,
running, and locating the Northeastern boundary line of this
Statp, and to cause the same to be carried into opeiauon '
It is here if any where, that Mr Forsyth finds the authority
for saying that the proposed negotiation is undertaken in a<
cordance with the expressed wishes cf the Legislature    It say s,
"if the Government of ihe United States sh til not establish and
appoint a commission for the survey of said boundaiy 'me
Does that authorize a commission for an exploration and survey
of the disputed territory, upon the basis of "the original Ame
rícaa propositien," with the modification* of the British Go
vernmenti   The meaning is obviou*    If the Government of the
United States does not run, mark, define, the line of the treaty,
Mame will do so on its own responsibility    The «survey of
the line" does aot mean an exploration^ which can lead to no
eonclusion, to no definite results,  Such a surrey -was eontem- J_
plated as should terminate tn something, not an examination
and report "unsatisfactory, inconclusive, looking to no re
suits " The piara meaning of the Legislature was, if such a
survey of the line as contemplated m the bill now pending m
Congress should not be undertaken, then the Governor was te
proceed to perform the duty devolved upon him by the resolu
tion Such was undoubtedly the construction of the Gsvernoi
«pon the tesolution jeferred to In his letter to Mr Forsyth of
20th April, he says
"I have no doubt (hut upon thrs point I speak according *o
my individual belief) that the mode proposed by Great Britain,
of establishing the treaty line upon the face of the earth, by a
commission composed of impartial and scientific men, tobe
selected by a friendly power, would he satisfactory, andacqui
eaced in by this Sta'e, hut that we should neither ask nor
agiee that any preliminary points should be yielded by either
party "
He is cautious not to commit the State, but to express only
his individual opinion, which is, that such a commission as is
proposed to Great Bntain would be satisfactory, ' but that we
should neither ask nor agree that any prelumnary points should
be yielded by either parly," in other words, that no "modmca
tions" should be admitted Mame will agree, he thinks, toes
tabhsh a commission to settle the question, according to the
treaty, upon the whole case, and upon all the evidence, unre
stneted by concessions, untrammelled by modifications, unem
barraesed by new pimciples of surveying Certain y, sii tl is
is going far enough, and i robably the Governor i¡= right in the
belief that Maine, in the present exigency, would be willing to
agiet, to this Cut, Iassuie you, she would agree to nothing
fuither She puts enough at hazard, in this view, but she io
reasonable, and knows that, m all controverted questions, what
evei mode of determining them is adopted, sorielhing is neces
sanly put at hazard This sentiment of the Governor by no
meai s authorizes the idea that Maine consents to the proposed
airangement, inconclusive and unsatisfactory as it has been
pionounced tobe, much less does it justify the assertion that
"it is m accordance with the expre sed wishes of her Legisla
tuie " As further proof, I will cue the report of the joint com
mittee of that I egislature, lo which the letter of Mr Toreyth
and the message of the Governor were refei i ed, upon this very
subject It says, ' to such a conventional line, or to such a
commission of suivey we believe the people of this. State aie
not prepared to assent " Certainly, sir, the Legis'atu e did not
intend theieev to give its astent to &uch acomm ««ion of suivey
—the very commission now proposed' I vtnture the piedic
tion that ere long, the Secretary will receive from the consti
tuted authoi mes of the St«te moie decisive eviderce than I can
giv e that the State does not assent to the pioposititn which has
been made
I hope, theiefoie if the Secretary has "ventured upon the as
sumption that Maine has expiessed its wishes in favor of such
a negotiation he will lose no time mietiactmg the profiere!
invitation H"1 hó.% pioceeded upon afalseba=is Mame does
not desire it nor does she agree to it She has not looked to
have a commission established whieh «mall have no conclusive
powers, which cannot determine the question, which can re
suit only in what Gieat Britain seemssomuch to desire—delay
Srocrastmation, putting off the final adjustment of theboun
ary It has been alreadv delayed too long One exped ent
and another, on the part of Gr at Britain has been successfully
resorted to, to delay—postpone—evade the issue We are
weaned of delays We agree to no proposition which looks
merely to delay Note is the time, now let the question be
sealed We think we ait not unreasonable We ha-ve wait-
ed a half centmy We have been laboring more than twenty
year , "mce the tieaty of Ghent, to procure a settlement of
this to us interesting and important question We are as far
fiom it, sa\s the President, as we were at the formation of the
treaty of 17b3   When shall we he any nearer"?
I said, sir, m the commencemert of these remarks, that I
would endeavor to pointout a modem which this vexed ques
tion could be amicably settled It js by the passage ol the bill
which, some time ago, I introduced, and which has since re
ceiverl the sanction of the Committee on Foieign Affairs I et
the Government of the United States nw\e in earnest, and no
collision, no difficulty, m my judgment need be apprehended
If Maine is lef to stand alone, «¡he will be exposed to meet wi h
opposition an 1 embarrassment and it may be wtthfoice But
she will meet it as becomes hei to meet it If the United States
will but unfml its broad banner there, that flag of protection
and security it will be respected The purposes of the bill I
have named may be executed amicably, if you will but do it I
do not sav that that will settle the question of boundary conclu
sively I know it may be s ill di«pu'ed It will go far, how
ever, toward such a re&ult I therefore entreat gentlemen to
permitus, theRepiesentativrsaif Maine, at an early day to call
their attention to this bill I implore them to give n their eoun

The pioposed negotiation take away none oí the nece=Mty for

on tin  geneial subject of whatl said some time ago Much I
could sa}, a id much Idet-ue to sav, were it a piopei occasion,
upon the merits of the whole controveisy I speak now,how
ever only in the language of cannon and ofa-'mnnition that the
rights of the State, committed mpaitto my chaige, may not be
rashly and prematurely put at hazard for the want of onme

SPEECH OF MEL CUSHING,
Of Massachusetts,
In the House of Representatives, Tnursday April 19,1^38—
On the proposition of Mi Under voon to recommit t! e bill
making appropriations f">r tie conunuauoi ot the Cumber
land road, with instructions to íeport a bill in lieu tner*nf,
ceding the came to the States tmoucb which it passes, aid
Mr Underwood having concluded his remarks—
Mr CUSHING followed, and «aid
Mr Speaker The gentleman from Kentucky, who ba=just
taken his place, appeals to the Representatives from Massacl u
setts, and inquires emphatically on what grounds the> suppoit
this bill I cannot answer for my colleagues, but, being thus
called upon, I desire to epeafc for myself, and to explain the
inducements which govern my own vote
It is not, as the gentleman seems to hint, because &t the fact
that Massachusetts is a frontier and a maritime State, aaá thus
becomes the seatofpubhc woiks, commercial ah&jouhtanr,
constiuctedby the Federal Goveromeütj that I favor tbjs bUi,
but for very differentand much higher consideration*.
Indeed, I profess myself wholly unable tc? appreciate 1&e
force of the argument on which that gentleman- aad &J& cei>
league [Mr Gravxs] rely so much, of the alleged inequality-4tt
the distribution oí public expenditures, assumed-hy theojí&oe
implied in thi3 b'U To suppose that each and every 0Faficfa.of
the public expenditure is tobe apportioned among the several
States in arithmetical shares^ is an idea that is utterly unsound
and impracticable
But I will not anticipate what Ihave to say on this pout at
the propei time    I et us take things m order
Reviewing the debate -on the bill yesterday anrtto-day, it
&eems to me that the course of argument m opposition to it
has been too bread, and at the same time not broad enough;
too broad, since it has been extended, on the one hand, so as to
embiacemany questions immaterial to us merits, and, on the
other hand, notbioad -enough, since it has avoided the real
menu, of the measure
Tir^t, the gentleman fiom Georgia, [Mr Haynes,] what are
hisobjections'i He appeals to the economical piopensitietf of
the House, m rather to the slumbeiing sentiment of economy
which he endeavors to awaken He would have the friends ef
retrenchments ow their faith -by men works But this are;u
ment proves too much to piove any thing It may be applied
to any and every bill, by thost, who dt&ukc the particular mea
sure Its pliability aud its indefinitenesa evince its iailacy. I
s( om the idea that the Federal Government is to be considered
in a state of bankruptcy and that every appropriation1,-how*
ever ju^t and pieper in itself, is to be cut off by reason of the
temporary atiaitsof thelieasury Is the country wasted or
depopulated> Ka\u we not the same n exhaustible resources
now at> herí- oroie n the fertility of our eoit, mour widespread
territory in oui m n mires «na in *he mdustiy, intelligence,
and spirit of oui peop'e? I exhoi gentlen en to cease declaim-
ing on theemp mes-- of t ie Treasury, and use their influence
for the restoration of the commercial proápemy of the country,
by which the Tieasuiy will be speedily replenished, as the
na ural and nee cs^ry consequence Let the Administration
abandon us empiricism on the cunency question, scatter ita
chuner cal schemes to the wind, «u«tam the banks m their
lau^bleeffoitstoiesume cash payments give back confidence
to ihe business clir t^, f ud pi ovule <i buitable medium of do-
mestic exchange and there will no lorgei he íoom or occasion
to dep'oie deficiencies in the Treasurv lor myself, I mean to
vote on thi* as on all othei appropriations, according to the
intra «ic mcntsof each, andas I may think them tobe required
or not by tht, public ^civice and the honor of the country
Anothei thing The gentleman from Geoigia conceives
iheieis, m ^ou eway, a connection between this measureand
imposts oí the fro enion of manufactures Oo thw question,
asor somaT otiers, we luve tne tanffset before u^a sort of
stalking hoi^coi iill woik abugbtarperpetually held up to the

not arise from the tai IT at all For twenty years past, the ag

abonttwent-v mii'ions The mciea^eof ie venue, \,hichled to
ihe accumulation of s irnlus trt isurc consisted, it is notorious,
m the met eased sales of public lands independent of which, I
avei that it was not the protective features of the tariff which
conmbuted to tl eiedundancy of the revenue, but the reverse,
*he encouragement which the provieionaof the Eanffgave to ex
ce^sive importations of foreign merchandise especially dry
goods, as injurious ai recti y to the manufactures of thecoun*
tiy, asmdnec ly to all its othej great interests, and one of the
prominent causes of us existing embarrassments But aU these
cont-idwrations of ihe taril arewideofthe merits of the bill, and
ought not to preju lice it m ihe estimation of the Hot se
Othei gent'emen dwell on the objet ion, that the passage of
this bill places additional patronage in the hands of the Execu*
tne So do a'lappripnation^ And for this cause mustwe,
who are oppo ed to the present Administration ^ote against

themselves Tl it cnr-sequence, the patronage they give to the
Admin sua itn, is incidental to the Constitution, it appertains
to he frame of die Government and it does not become «s to
renstoidinaiy and reasonable appropriations, because of any
vague or theoretic ¡ealou^y of the bxtcutive
The two gent emen fiom Ke u cky treat this measure asan

The gentleman fiom Kentucky [Mr Underwood] suggests
that Mass chusetts has no share in this appiopnation any mora
than Kentucky aid mthat icpect Uis unequal towards each
Be it so I do not contend for appropriations by appor-
tionment
But then he proceeds to suggest further, that Massachusetts,
though she receiv e no appropriations from the Federal Govern-
ment foi loads is compensated b^ her fortifications, naval
woiKs3and light houses, in which he seem<* to «ay, Kentucky
ha-j no benefit Can the gentleman be senotis m this? Does
the lnteuor of the countiy derive no advantage from the rmh-
taiy defence^ on its frontier? Is not the countrv one? íes, he
