CHARLESTON, S. C., January 28, 1863.

H. W. MERCER, Brigadier-General, Pocotaligo, S. C.:

No iron-clads can be in Georgia waters; would be more required elsewhere now; moreover, would have come close up to fort; must be shams.

Communicate this to Major Bryan.

G. T. BEAUREGARD.

CHARLESTON, S. C., January 30, 1863.

Major HENRY BRYAN,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Savannah, Ga.:

Enemy's gunboats may be iron-clad of inferior quality. At Drewry's Bluff monitor came to 600 yards. I regret having no heavier guns for Genesis Point.

G. T. BEAUREGARD.

CHARLESTON, January 30, 1863.

General G. T. BEAUREGARD:

GENERAL: I have received from Colonel Yates--

Another boat came up and driven back. Shall I retire with my guns? One man wounded on our side. Enemy's loss heavy.

I replied:

Have guns enough in position to protect prize. chesterfield will be with you as soon as possible. Fear not until morning. As soon as prize is safe or destroyed, if compelled to destroy, retire. On no account must she be recaptured.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. S. RIPLEY.

CHARLESTON, January 30, 1863.

General G. T. BEAUREGARD, Commanding:

GENERAL: Your note received. Have received a dispatch from Colonel Yates telling me that there were two more boats in Stono and saying he was out of ammunition; would blow up the Smith and retire. I telegraphed in return not to destroy her until the last; I would send ammunition and boat at once. I have accordingly started the Sumter, light-draught boat, which can get thorough Wappoo at any tide, with forty 8-inch shell and cartridges and a guard. I hope she will be alongside the Isaac Smith in three hours, and take the flood tide with her up to Fort Pemberton. She could not tow the Smith on the ebb or I would have had her through at once. I hope it will be all right.

Very respectfully,

R. S. RIPLEY,

Brigadier-General.
