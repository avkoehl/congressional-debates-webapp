UPTON'S HILL, June 25, 1863.

Major-General BUTTERFIELD:

A dispatch has been received during the night from General Slough, military governor of Alexandria, informing me that the commanding officer of the Second Brigade, Pennsylvania Reserve Corps, has been instructed by him not to recognize the orders sent to him to prepare to join the division, as directed in your dispatch of June 23.

S. W. CRAWFORD,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

WASHINGTON, D. C., June 25, 1863-2 p. m.

Major-General HOOKER,

Army of the Potomac:

The Second Brigade, to which you refer in your telegram, forms no part of General Crawford's command, which was placed at your orders. No other troops can be withdrawn from the Defenses of Washington.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.

WASHINGTON, D. C., June 25, 1863.

Major-General HOOKER,

Army of the Potomac:

The immense loss and destruction of horses in your army, and the difficulty of supplying this loss, render it necessary that you should impress every serviceable animal likely to fall into the hands of the enemy. There are many animals in Loudoun County and the adjacent parts of Maryland. These should be seized, to save them from the enemy, as well as to supply yourself.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.

WASHINGTON, June 25, 1863.

General HOOKER:

The President has assigned General Hancock to the command of the Second Corp.

E. D. TOWNSEND,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

POOLESVILLE, June 26, 1863.

(Received 8. 15 p. m.)

Major-General HALLECK,

Washington:

I desire every facility to be in readiness for supplies to be thrown to Frederick by rail.

JOSEPH HOOKER,

Major-General.
