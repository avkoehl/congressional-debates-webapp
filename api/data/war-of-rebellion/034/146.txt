MARCH 13, 1863.-Skirmish at Rover, Tenn.

Report of Brigadier General John A. Wharton, C. S. Army.
HEADQUARTERS WHARTON'S CAVALRY,Unionville, March 13, 1863-7 p. m.

GENERAL: I have the honor to report that the table was turned upon the Yankee cavalry to-day, and they are running. A considerable bevy of Yankee cavalry came down to our picket stand at Rover. Captain Gordon, of my scout company, skirmished with them from near Ealgeville to Rovere. Captain [W. C.] Bacot, a most gallant officer of [A. A.] Russell's regiment (whom I have long known), was out on a scout, and charged the enemy on their flank while they were engaging our men in front. The enemy fled before Bacot, and, with Gardner's company, they were pursued to their reserves, 3 miles, capturing 1 prisoner, of Jeff. [Jefferson C.] Davis' division. Reached Eagleville to-day about noon, from Triune. I think he is on his way back to Murfreesborough; will know to-morrow. Sheridan's division is, from [all I] can learn, at Versailles. This point is important, and I shall concentrate more cavalry here. Please ask Captain [W. B.] Richmond or [H. C.] Yeatman to send me the latest papers.

Most respectfully, general, your obedient servant,

JNO. A. WHARTON,

Brigadier-General.

Lieutenant General LEONIDAS POLK,

Commanding, &amp;c.

My cavalry found another party of rebel cavalry yesterday near Charlotte, capturing 13 prisoners with horses. Five are new conscripts, who claim to be Union men, and desire to take the oath. Instruct men.

We captured a few more rebels to-day. The country is clear. No danger on river. Their whole force has crossed Duck River low down for fear of being cut off.
