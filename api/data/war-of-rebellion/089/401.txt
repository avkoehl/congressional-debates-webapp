HATCHER'S FARM, October 27, 1864 - 7.30 p. m.

Major-General BUTLER,

Commanding Army of the James:

On receiving your telegram, accompanied by Colonel Potter, I made a reconnaissance from Battery Marshall to the right of the picket-line. At the same time one of my staff officers made a reconnaissance to the Appomattox River. The relief picket was then thrown out by the road leading to Battery Drake, supported by the Twelfth New Hampshire. It was nearly dark when this movement was made, and Colonel Potter has not yet returned. The rebel picket-line appears to have been weakened. The pickets are not at all communicative, and our men report that there have been several trains to-day more then usual, the trains down empty and those up full.

CHARLES K. GRAHAM,

Brigadier-General.

HATCHER'S FARM, October 27, 1864 - 8 p. m.

Major-General BUTLER:

The telegram sent me at noon did not reach me until between 3 and 4 o'clock. At once I attended to its spirit, but night overtook me before a satisfactory result could be obtained. I returned at 7.30. Colonel Potter has not yet returned.

CHARLES K. GRAHAM,

Brigadier-General.

CITY POINT, VA., October 28, 1864 - 9 a. m.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

The enemy attacked our left (Hancock) last evening with great vigor. I cannot give the results yet, though the fight was sanguinary on both sides and resulted in a considerable number of captures. General Hancock thinks he captured more prisoners than he lost. I will try to give you full particulars during the day.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
