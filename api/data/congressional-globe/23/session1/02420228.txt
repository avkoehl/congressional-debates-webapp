THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
March 11,
had not postponed his reply so long, but had hon-
ored him with his notice at the time, he would
have taken pleasure in correcting him
What he said was, that the people of the whole
country were suffering distress, and that they
would not be content till they had produced a
change through the ballot boxes Mr C said
he did go for a revolution, but it was for that kind
of revolution which should bring back the Gov
eminent to the true principles of the Constitution,
and until that was done, he cared not whether we
were driven to power to accompli„h it But he
preferred the ballot-box, and when, as men, we
complained of the Constitution being trampled
under foot, he held to the right of exercising that
power, which our fathers exerted in the war of
the Revolution The gentleman ft om North Caro-
lina had said that the distress had not reached his
constituents, probably the fact would be otherwise
by and by He (Mr C ) was convinced that two
months would not elapse till the tone of many of
those who have sustained this Administration will
be completely changed We had been told, too,
by another honorable gentleman, that our cries
were like those made m obedience to the mandate
of the preacher who cried, Gioan, sinner, groan
But he thought there was a certain class of poll
ticians who would not be less loud in their groans
by and by Ihe gentleman [Mr Brown] com
plained of the power of the bank, but could see no
danger fiom the assumption of executive power,
none coming from the White House He proudly
acknowledged himself to be one of those who sus
tamed the Je^ersoman principles, and y t the
•very men whom he sustained, rose into power
on the contest between the executive and the
people
Mr BROWN said he should not have noticed
the gentleman's observations, if he had not been
led to it by the remarks of othei gentlemen The
gentleman from Delaware [Mr Clayton] yet tells
us that he appioves of the people releasing them-
selves from their alleged embanassments at the
polls, but if they cannot effect it in that way, they
must do it at any rate He has stated that they
must be released at all events, and we are to
understand him as having adopted the maxim
"Peaceably if we can, forcibly it we must " Sir,
the great mass of tne people will scowl at and
contemn the invitation to npairtothe standard
of revolt Ihey never can be induced to rally in
support of a great moneyed aristocracy He ad-
mitted the right of the people, to the fullest extent,
to resist the unlawful measures ot the Government,
but he nevei would believe that the people would
eubmit to the i ule of a moneyed aristocracy Tne
gentleman s ud that he (Mr Bnowv) peiceived
great dangers in the bink, but could appiehend
none fiom the White House. Mi B said he had
thoroughly and carefully examined the subject
alluded to, and his vision was too obtuse to see
thedangers in it which some other gentlemen saw
But if it were otherwise, he would not place the
rustody of the public money in tne power of the
bank, which was irresponsible to the people The
President of the United States was responsible to
the people evety foui years, it was not so with
the bank, which wa? chartered for twenty years,
and thus ¡emoved fiom the people during that
wnolepenod its influencewas invi ible—its oper
ations lenovtd from the public eye—it insinuated
Ji«eif into a thousand pl-ces wheie the public eye
c mid not trace it out I he conduct of the Lxecu
tive was visiblt, while tha^ of a gnat moneyed
institution, and an irresponsible power, was secret,
and theieioie dangerous to the Ubeities of the
people
Mr FORSYTH saii we had now presented to
us a fair ¡.dvertisement of tne a/owed purpose of
petitioning Oongiess and adding to the gioans
a'ready sourded in our ear  and here we have
the resa't He thought there was sufficient now
be ore us to teach gentlemen not to be misapme-
hending the condit on of the country The gen
tleman from New Jersey had made a Ions speech
on the subject and yet from the State of New Jei-
sey we had three wheels foi one groan The gen-
tleman from Delaware 'hought there was a certain
class of politicians who would groan for their I
political sin-,, instead of by commands from the
pulpit Mr r cong-atulnted the gentleman on the
discovery he had made    But the gentleman fiom
New Jersey was mistaken in regard to his (Mr
F 's) situation He had not said that he con-
demned the removal of the deoosues, or that he did
not defend it He had defended it, and his defence
was before the world He had said that he would
have delayed it As a party man, he said he
regretted there had not been more delay, but for
the good of the country, perhaps the decision of
the President was best But he had another cause
of complaint against the honorable gentleman fiom
New Jersey The gentleman said that he (Mr
F ) complained of the complaints made here.
Mr FRELINGHUYSEN disclaimed any allu-
sion to him
Mr FORSYTH resumed. It was but the other
day that he complained of talking too much—of
thiowmg too much light on the subject One
thing was certain, if the people were suffering or
had any cause of complaint, so far as the Senate
were in fault, the sin laid at the door of gentlemen
on the other side of the House In vain could they
expect relief from the President or the Adminis-
tration, they know the sentiments of the Admin-
istration not to be theirs Why, then, did they not
act upon their own views' Whynotact' Do they
decline acting here because they want the action
of the peopl  on the other end of the House, w ith
a view to make their action correspond with the
majority heie' If gentlemen imagine that by delay
they may expect the people to act on the other
end of the Capitol, why they will have the benefit
of the experiment It was impossible to shut our
eyes to the fact that the recharter of the bank was
what was sought for If we could be blind now,
our eyes would be opened shortly But there
suiely was enough n a neighboring State within
a few davs past to determine what the views of
the people were on t^is subject Here was a State
almost the laigest in tne Union—a State whose
Legislature was but a short time since unanimous
in favor of the institution, and what was the s'ate
of the case now  A thorough Uiange had taken
place, and the ciy rung from one end of the State
to the other, "Down with the bank1" Mr F
said he thought this would have been sufficient to
startle gentlemen, and to satisfy them tl at their
anticipations were without foundation When
gentlemen look to the light which they perceive to
be bieaking through for the purpose of pro<=tiatmg
those in power, he would suppose they would not
be very sorry for it, or that the experiment, as
they teimed it, had been made Supposing there
should be distress, and the wido,y and the orphan
should be made to feel it, what a glonous ieas.on
it would affoid for exclaiming against the tyrant,
and for hurling the despot fiom his throne But
he thought gentlemen would find themselves mis-
taken m their expectations of the effect to be pro-
duced by it    We shall soon see
Mr BRELlNGHUYSENolserved.thatifhe
had fallen into complaint', if he had been makirg
long speeches, he had only been doing what the
gentleman from Geoigia did, not what he saiii
His situation ..urely was sufficiently embarrassing,
but his wheel, which was turning, might yet place
himself and the gentleman in a similar situation,
and when he should íeceive mstractions, if he
deteimined to disobey them, he should have his
hearty support and countenance
Mr FORS\TH disclaimed anything personal
in his observations He tnanked the gentleman
from New Jersey for his good wishes As to the
situation of the honorab'e gentleman from New
Jersey, he sincerely sympatl ized with him, and
hoped that, before long, the Lord would send him
deliveiance
Mi SPR VGtTC rose to protest against thegen-
tleman from Geoigia imputing sentiments here to
Senators, which he, foi one, cntiH/ repudiated,
that we were not sorry this experiment had been
tried Tns gen leman was not author zed to say
so All dee,'y lamented the Executive experi-
ment on the business ai d happiness of the people
of the United States The gentleman hoped the
experiment .vould not be so fa'al as those trying
it « ould make it He (Mr S ) protested against
its being made a mere paity question, for he be
heieá he, and tho«e with wnom he acted, would
almost agree to perpetuate the Administration of
the pres-nt Cni«f Magistrate, if he would grant
lehef When h« looked at the effertof thi« meas-
ure on his constituents, and that this effect wouid
go on, he saw that it was a measure which must
prostrate their happiness, their business, and their
prospenty
Mr FORSYTH replied that the gentleman
fiom Maine [Mi ^Prague] protested against the
injustice of having ascribed to him gratification at
the " experiment," as he calls it Well, nobody
knew his motives better than he did himself
But when his course here, for the last four years,
had been marked with a constant succession of
charges against this Administration, he must have
a strangely constituted mind, if he did not desire
the Administration to be thrown out of power
Now, where was the injustice of supposing this,
when the gentleman thought he had his foot upon
the neck of the tyrant' He might shut his eyes
on the operations of his own mmd,but others
could see it And when declarations are daily
made here against the whole party, are we not jus-
tified by the gentleman's example' Did be not
every day impute unworthy motives to his oppo-
nents here' Let the gentleman's conduct go to
his constituents he tells us we don't understand
public opinion Does the noise he hears come
from his constituents, or does he know more of
othei parts of the United States than be does of
his own ' If not, he is in error, if in other parts
of the United States, hecan't be at his own home
H" was accused by the gentleman of groaning,
and yet groaned himself, yet he would not changa
his condition for that of the honorab'e gentleman,
under any circumstances I maintain a situation
far above party, which, so help me God, 1 will
stand in I hope the gentleman will give and
take, and when he mak.es imputations broadcast
upon others, he will be willing to receive them in
retuin again
Mr SJPRAGrUE said it was easy to make broad
general declarations, impugning the motives of
others He would be obliged to the gentleman
from Georgia, if he wou d soecify particular in-
stances lie had always endeavored to treat gen-
tlemen here with respect, and w ould have been
obliged to the gentleman to have mentioned an
instance when he had not done so The gentle-
man had referred to the opinions of his constitu-
ents But the time might arrive when the people
of Georgia would express opinions against the gen-
tleman's course He (Mr 8 ) knew the people
of Maine—he was bound to consult their interests,
although he knew his political life would be sacri-
nxed by it He believed tnat if they knew and
could perceive the truths which weie poured in
here, in relation to th s Administration, they would
sustain hirrf in the stand he had taken against it.
If personal objects had been in his view, could he
not have seen the means of obtaining executive
patronage, and have yielded his support to the
Administration '
Mr FORSYTH thought the issue had been
made between us The question was about de-
votion to power, to those possessing patronage
within a few years past If the gentleman would
cast his eyes back some twleve yeais, he would
find that his devotion to the Powers that be, had
been much greater than his It was, bus (Mr F 'a)
misfortune to 1 ave differed with most of the Ad-
mmistiations since he had had the honor of a seat
in the Congi ess of the United States, and witn this
one,also, on some points Thecnes of patronage
against thePowers that be, were nothing more than
t! at those who were out of power might displace
tho e who were in power It was notquite so asy
to get powei fiom the people, as place from those
m power Let gentlemen, then, get then places
if they had no higher ambitien than to get a petty
offi e under the Government Toi himself, his
ambition  aid higher
Somefirther remaiks were made by Messrs
SHEPLEYand SPRAGDE, when the memorials
were referred to the Committee on Finance
Mr GRUNDY presented the memorial of the
trusses of Nasnville University, asking the m'er-
position of Congress in effecting a change of cer-
tain lands formerly granted for the use of that in-
stitution, which was referred to the Committee o*„
Public Lands
Mr WRIGHT, from the Committee or Claims,
reported a bill for the relief of Peter H Gieen,
which was read a fiist time, and the report and
accompanying documents were then ordered to be
printed
