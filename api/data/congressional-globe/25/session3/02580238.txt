238                                   THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.                  March 3, 1839,
port at all times given to me by this House, I
should have been utterly unable to preserve that
order and decorum which should ever attend the
deliberations of the i epi esentatives of the people
It has been made my duty to decide more ques-
tions of parliamentary law and of order, many of
them of a complex and difficult character, arising
often in the midst of high excitement, in the
course of our pi occedings, than had been decided,
it is believed, by all my predecessors, from the
foundation of this Government This House has
uniformly sustained me, without distinction of
the political parties of which it has been com-
posed. Our íecoids will show, that upon the nu-
merous appeals which have been taken to the
House, I have been sustained by both political
parties, and often by decided and large majorities
Though doubtless I may often have fallen into
error in promptly deciding novel questions, sud-
denly raised, I trust it was not on points maten il,
and I know it %vas never intended I return to
this House my thanks for their constant support
m the discharge of the arduous and difficult duties
I have had to perform
But, gentlemen, my acknowledgments are es-
pecially due to the majority of this House for the
h gh and flattering evidence they have given me
of their approbation of my conduct as the pre-
siding officer of the House, by the resolution you
have been pleased to pass I regard this as the
highest and most valued testimonial I have ever
received from this House, because I know that the
encumstances under which it has passed has
made it matter of substance, and notof mere form.
I regard it as of infinitely more value than if it
had been the common matter-of couise and cus-
tomary resolution, which, in tht courtesy usually
prevailing between the piesiding officer and the
members of any deliberate assembly, is always
passed at the close of their deliberations That
ib unmeaning—lsmdibcuniinately conferred—is a
mere act of couitesy, and possesses, compara
[j tively, but little value Í return to the majority
Ij of this House, what I smceieiy feel, my grateful
thanks for this high evidence of their approba-
tion and regaid, given, as it has been, at a time
of high party excitement, which, in the accom-
plishment of party and political objects, but too
often disregards all othei considerations I shah
bear it in grateful remembiance to the latest hour
of my life
I tiust this high office may in future times be
filled, as doubtless it will be, by abler men It
cannot, I know, be filled by any one who will d< -
vote himself with more zeal and untiring industry
to do his whole duty than I have done
We are now about to separate, many of us
never again to meet I wish you, gentlemen, a
safereturn to your families and friends, and what-
ever oui respective futuie destinies may be, my
prayer to a beneficent and overruling Piovidence
is, that our futuie lives may be useful and happy
