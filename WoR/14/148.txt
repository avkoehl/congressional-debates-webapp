Colonel GEO. A. H. BLAKE,Commanding Brigade of Cavalry:

COLONEL: The commanding general direction that you send immediately a squadron of cavalry, under an efficient and prudent officer, to Mulberry Point, on the James River side, and such other points on Mulberry Island as were occupied of the enemy in that quarter. It will be ascertained if guns or other property were abandoned by the enemy.

It is desired that you procure a guide in Yorktown to accompany the troops, if possible.

A map is sent you containing all the information in possession of the topographical bureau at these headquarters with regard to the region in question.

The duty involved will require circumspection on the part of the officer to guard against any surprise, and is to be executed with expedition and dispatch.

On his return the officer will make a detailed report of his expedition.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

An attack on Sewell's Point batteries will be made to-day by Commodore Goldsborough and General Wool.
