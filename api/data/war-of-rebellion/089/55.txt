HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,October 3, 1864. (Received 10 a. m.)

General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

The following report from Major Walsh is forwarded:
HEADQUARTERS BATTALION THIRD PENNSYLVANIA CAVALRY,

October 3, 1864-8.45 a. m.

Colonel MORGAN,

Chief of Staff, Second Corps:

COLONEL: I have the honor to report that since 6 o'clock yesterday evening my pickets have been much annoyed by small parties of the enemy appearing in front and firing on the outposts. The largest party seen did not number over ten; at the same time small parties have been seen far inside of the outer pickets, and one of my camp guard was fired at from the thick woods at daylight this morning. All is perfectly quiet up to this.

Respectfully,

J. W. WALSH,

Major, Commanding Battalion Third Pennsylvania Cavalry.

C. H. MORGAN,

Colonel and Chief of Staff.

[Indorsement.]

I don't know that anything can be done with this.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,October 3, 1864-9.25 a. m.

Major-General HANCOCK,

Commanding Second Corps:

The commanding general wishes to know what that sharp musketry firing, with some artillery firing, was this morning about 2 o'clock. General Ferrero reported it to be on his right.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,October 3, 1864-10.15 a. m.

General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

There must be some mistake. No firing was heard here, and the guard was specially instructed to give notice of any. The division commanders do not report any. The chief of artillery reports a few rounds fired from the mortars. The corps officer of the day, who slept in Fort Morton, says he heard no unusual firing.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.
