Ryan's command with ten days' full rations; then to retain the balance for the use of the infantry and artillery. Captain Hesser will not land any more subsistence from the Alamo than is necessary for the cavalry and the immediate wants of the artillery and infantry. Use any of Lieutenant Moreland's wagons you may need for your own movement.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Colonel WOOD,

Commanding, Brownsville:

It is reported that the rebels are coming up Bayou Meto bottom. The general wished you to send a scouting party in that direction. Colonel Trumbull will send a party out; probably one from Pine Bluff will got in that direction. Has anything been heard from Captain Miner?

Captain C. H. DYER,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Captain Miner returned last night. He scouted all around Bayou Meto bottom, and is sure no rebels are crossing. The country through which he passed is full of guerrillas. Two of the captain's men were wounded by them. He also learned that the rebels have erected batteries on the Arkansas River, below Pine Bluff. Marmaduke's whole command is reported on the river below the Bluff.

Captain C. H. DYER,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Captain Miner was 60 miles from here, over in Arkansas bottom. He reports to me that he passed around Bayou Meto bottom. The object of the expedition was not fully accomplished. Will go myself as soon as the horses are sufficiently rested. We have about 200 horses and mules. Is it possible to get any saddles and bridles at Little Rock? The old saddles that we get from the country are not fit to use.

Colonel TRUMBULL,
