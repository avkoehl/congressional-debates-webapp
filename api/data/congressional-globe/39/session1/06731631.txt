upon the throne;" and we may at last join our
voices in glad hosamias over a regenerated
nation. But the yielding of the first iota of
the great principles of liberty at stake would
be a disgraceful compromise of the dignity and
honor of the nation.
"What boots it at one gate to make defense,
And at another let in the foe?''
Our safety alone lies in guarding the citadel
at every point. Make strong the weak places,
and take care no treacherous foe in friendly
guise shall pass within our walls to betray us
to our ruin.
Mr. HOG-AN. I desire to make some re-
marks, but I prefer not to go on this after-
noon. T have agreed to yield to the gentleman
from Ohio, [Mr. Lawrence,] with the under-
standing that 1 shall be recognized as entitled
to the floor when the House again meets for
general debate.
The SPEAKERpro tempore, (Mr. Thayer.)
That will be the understanding, if there be no
objection.
There was no objection.
PAYMENT FOR SLAYES.
Mr. LAWRENCE, of Ohio. Mr. Speaker,
the social and political changes effected as a
consequence of the rebellion require some
amendments to the great charter of our liber-
ties, the Constitution of the United States. If
there is any one thing more than all others
demanded by the loyal people of the country,
it is that amendments shall be speedily sub-
mitted by Congress to the States for their ap-
proval which shall change the basis of repre-
sentation in Congress and the Electoral Col-
lege, and shall forever prohibit the payment
of the confederate and State debts contracted
in aid of the rebellion, and shall prohibit the
nation and the States from making payment
on account of the emancipation of slaves.
I propose now to discuss the last of these
propositions as embodied in a joint resolution
reported to this House on the loth day of
March, with the pending amendment thereto.
This proposition to amend the Constitution is
contained in an article in these words:
" Sec. 1. Neither Congress nor any State shall ever
authorize, pro\ 3de lor, or make payment to any per-
son or poisons on account of the emancipation of
any slave or slaves, or a? compensation therefor.
" Skc. 2. Congress shall have power to enforce this
article by appiopriatc legislation, and the judicial
power of the United Slated --hall extend to all cases
ari«ii]« under 1 his article and the laws made m pur-
suance thereof."
The immediate question which must be first
voted on and decided is the pending amend-
ment, to add to section one these words:
"Except as provided by statute in force prior to
the 1st d;iy of January, 1803."
I will now briefly explain the object of this
amendment, and then the House can determine
whether it should bo adopted or whether it
may not bo boat to reject it and let provision
bo "made to discharge all existing obligations
for slaves between this time and the period
when the proposed amendment to the Consti-
tution shall go into effect, if it shall be sanc-
tioned by Congress and the requisite number
of the State Legislatures.
If the proposed amendment to the Constitu-
tion could be adopted exactly as it stands, with-
out the pending amendment to it, consistently
with good faith, 1 would most certainly urge it,
with the hope that it would secure the sanction
of the House, the people, and a sufficient number
of the States to make it a part of the Constitu-
tion. But Congress, by an act approved Feb-
ruary 24, 1804, has assumed some obligations
or made pledges, the performance of which may
not properly be refused.
Bv section twenty-four of that act it is pro-
vided that able-bodied male colored persons
shall form a put of the national forces; and
when a slave of a loyal master shall be drafted
and mustered into the service, he shall be free,
and his master shall have a certificate therefor,
and the bounty of $100, allowed by law, shall
be paid to the master.
It is further provided that—
" The Secretary of War shall appoint a commission
in each of the slave States represented in Congress,
charged to award to each loyal person to whom a col-
ored volunteer may owe service a,just compensation,
not exceeding $300 tor each colored volunteer, paya-
ble out of the fund derived from commutations; and
every such colored volunteer, on being mustered into
the service, shall be free."
By the letter of the Secretary of War, dated
January <J, 180G, we learn these factsthat
under this act commissioners were appointed
in Maryland and Delaware, and that the Presi-
dent has suspended further appointments:
The commutation funds referred to in the act amount-
ed to 817,877,504 45
The cxpcndituics trom that fund tor
procuration of substitutes, recruits,
bounties, and premiums, including
$30,000 paid the chief of Bureau of Col-
ored Troops, and for enrollment and
draft to January 10,1800, were  8,362,641 00
Balance subject to draft, January 11,
1800  $9,514,923 45
There were filed with the commission for
Maryland for compensation three thousand
eight hundred and sixty-seven claims. Awards
were made on seven hundred and eighty-six
claims, amounting to $230,750, and of these
twenty-five were paid, amounting to §0,900.
The commission was dissolved October 18,
18G5.
The commission for Delaware awarded $11,-
833 on forty-three of the one hundred and four-
teen claims filed with them, no part of which
has been paid. This commission was dissolved
July C, 1805.
Whatever obligation the nation has incurred
under this act, to the extent of the means of
payment therein provided, may or may not be
paid, depending on the action of the Govern-
ment hereafter.
Maryland has passed laws also, providing
for payment for slaves enlisted as soldiers, and
it is not proposed to disturb this. (See acts of
February 0, 180-1, Laws of Maryland, chapter
fifteen, page 20 ; act of March 10, 18G4, chapter
two hundred and forty-six, Laws, page 335'.)
A joint resolution was passed by Congress
and approved April 10, 1802, declaring—
"That the United States ought to cooperate with
any State which may adopt gradual abolishment of
slaveiy, giving to such State pecuniary aid," A:c.
But the Government has not incurred any
liability under that resolution since no State
acted on it. It was indignantly spumed by the
States which might have profited by it. The
proposed amendment to the Constitution will
exclude any claim under that resolution.
The ameudmeflt now pending is designed to
except from the operation of the constitutional
amendment, as originally introduced, claims
for compensation under the laws already in
force, to which I have referred.
Whatever shall be paid for slaves will be the
discharge of a duty imposed by good faith as
the performance of a pledge already made. I
do not concede the legal duty to pay for any
slave at any time or in any form. No matter
what interpretations have been given to the
Constitution, it recognizes slaves as "persons,"
not "property," and in declaring the condi-
tion of persons, their i-ight to liberty, either
by constitutional amendment or the exercise
of the war power, there results no claim for
compensation. "There is nothing in the laws
of nature or of God which gives to inan the
right of property in man." Slaves' are not
property at common law, (Anderson vs. Poin-
dexter, 6 Ohio State Reports, 622,) and in the
States where slavery has been abolished no
compensation has ever been made for emanci-
pated slaves. When mustered into the mili-
tary service they stand on the footing of other
persons, and do not constitute property applied
to the public use by the exercise of the right of
eminent domain. But the obligations of good •
faith under existing laws rest upon a different
footing.
And now I will submit a few words in sup ■
port of the proposed amendment to the Con-
stitution. Our present national debt may be
set down in round numbers at $3,000,000,000,
to say nothing of State, county, city, village,
and town indebtedness. It is of vast impor-
tance to the holders of national and other bonds
to know if this indebtedness is to be increased.
If it shall be, our national credit will be im-
paired, and when we come to renew the na-
tional bonds as they fall due, a higher rate of
interest will be required if our indebtedness
may be increased than if nothing of this sort
is in contemplation or may be possible.
It is of vast importance to the people that
they shall know if their burdens may be in-
creased to pay for four million slaves, for i£ so
there will come up a voice of complaint that
will not be misunderstood. It, is of vast im-
portance to the people of the late slave States,
or those who may desire to make homes there,
to know if the material prosperity of those
States is to be retarded and industry loaded
with insupportable taxation to discouragc im-
migration and to prohibit the investment of
capital in enterprises from which revenues
and prosperity will accrue to the States. The
wdiole nation is interested in knowing whether
the late slave States may be so burdened with
taxes that their property and people shall be
unable to bear a full share of the load of debt
imposed upon all by the slaveholders' rebel-
lion, the rebellion of southern so-called De-
mocracy in arms against the national life. Yet
if four million slaves should be paid for at the
rate of §300 each, it would create a debt of
$1,200,000,000, nearly one half as much as the
whole national debt created by the war. This
price would not equal the estimated value of
the slave population at the commencement of
the war, especially when we remember that
able-bodied men sold at from one thousand to
two thousand dollars each. But even at the
valuation 1 have named, it would require one
sixth of all the wealth of tlie late slave States
to pay for the emancipated slaves, as may be
seen from a statistical table which I submit to
the House, as follows:
