HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,July 31, 1864 (Received 2 p.m.)

Colonel ABBOT:

I am loading eight wagons from my own train with the 4 1/2-inch ammunition from Castle Hell. All the siege materials on the Fifth Corps line except the above have started.

THOS. ALLCOCK,

Lieutenant-Colonel Fourth New York Artillery.
HEADQUARTERS EIGHTEENTH ARMY CORPS,July 31, 1864.

Colonel ABBOT:

I have sent Captain Osborne with the 13-inch mortar to City Point by rail. Will you communicate further orders to him?

T. S. TRUMBULL,

Major.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,July 31, 1864. (Received 8.35 p.m.)

Colonel ABBOT:

Have you a good and short road to City Point? Have you received orders to load your siege materials on the vessels? Had you not better telegraph to City Point for instructions on the subject? The orders were to send it all to City Point. It is just possible they want it there and do not want it shipped. I fear General Ord has stripped himself too bare of heavy guns.

H. J. HUNT,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Artillery.

BROADWAY LANDING, VA., July 31, 1864-8.35 p.m.

Brigadier-General HUNT,

Headquarters Army of the Potomac:

I received orders from General Grant to keep my train afloat, except what was in use, and upon this authority have been loading, as fast as possible. I am satisfied that this is what is now desired, from a remark made to one of my officers in relation to the 13-inch mortar, but will telegraph as you desire. There is a good road to City Point. General Ord has retained in position of my train three 30-pounder Parrotts, ten 8-inch mortars, and sixteen Coehorns, which makes his line very well secured with his light batteries, in my judgment. My gun carriages are merely run on barges, not put in the hold, and can be very rapidly unloaded. We have done wonders in the way of moving and loading the train. Everything is exactly as I desire in this respect.

HENRY L. ABBOT,

Colonel First Connecticut Artillery.

BROADWAY LANDING, VA., July 31, 1864.-8.40 p.m.

Colonel BOWERS,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Armies in the Field, City Point:

General Hunt suggests that I notify you that I am loading my train as rapidly as possible at Broadway Landing, this being my understand-
