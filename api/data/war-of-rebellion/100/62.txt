General SCHOFIELD, Goldsborough:

Have just arrived. All well. Have completed arrangements for twenty five additional barges and five tugs. General McCallum, fork railroad department, is with me. We will be up to-night. Telegraph me any news if there be any. General Grant with his whole army marched out of their lines toward Dinwiddie Court-House, and Lee must attack him or the force left intrenched at City Point. Sheridan is on Grant's left. I saw him and the President, and have a full understanding. Everything seems most favorable. I want to be all ready by April 10. Please send this message to Slocum and Howard. Tell General Slocum the orders were made he asked for. Also your two corps and commanders are as you requested. We must hold on to Kinston until the last moment, and then throw everything round by water to Halifax, Winton, and Norfolk.
