HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,April 2, 1865-1.15 a.m.

Brevet Major-General WEBB,

Chief of Staff:

The enemy reply to our artillery with all their batteries, and the skirmishers develop an infantry force still in our front. I fear that unless we find a weak place the attack ordered at 4 will not be attended with success.

JNO. G. PARKE,

Major-General.

General WEBB:

General Parke is at the Avery house. He had not received your telegram.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,April 2, 1865-1.30 a.m.

Bvt. Major General A. S. WEBB,

Headquarters Army of the Potomac:

My skirmishers have as yet found no weak place for an assault to-night. If found columns will be pushed in. No change in their infantry or artillery has been developed. I fear the demonstration will render an assault at 4 o'clock abortive.

Major-General.
