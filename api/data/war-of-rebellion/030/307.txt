Major General AMBROSE E. BURNSIDE,

Falmouth, Va.:

Richmond papers of the 6th say General Rosecrans is in possession of Murfreesborough, and the rebel army has retreated 30 miles, and that this opens Eastern Tennessee; and if General Rosecrans takes possession of it, 200,000 rebel troops cannot drive him out.

GALLATIN, January 7, 1863.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

Colonel Van Derveer, of the Thirty-fifth Ohio Regiment, just in from Hartsville, reports that a part of Bragg's army was moving rapidly toward Kentucky. His informer reports them crossing the river some 40 miles above Gallatin. They are said to be seizing all the horses and mules in the country and mounting the men. He says his information is from a private source. I cannot say how much truth there is in the report. I deemed it my duty to inform you. I will endeavor to ascertain the truth of the report and inform you.

SPEED S. FRY,

Brigadier-General.
