Major HUNT,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General:

W. J. Gaines, having letters from Colonel Kelton, General Halleck's staff, reports that a company of Ninth New York Cavalry, have found at Fairfax some 250 stand of arms and 6 boxes fixed ammunition, 3 barrels powder, 150 boxes of cartridges and bayonets, some picks and spades. He also says they will be unable to hold the place unless re-enforced, as the citizens are preparing for an attack. He says he heard that the rebels are in force about 5 or 6 miles beyond Centreville, having about 40,000 men. Shall I send any force to Fairfax, or take any action in the matter? I have a scout, on whom I can rely, who told me he was in Dranesville, and 4 miles beyond. Saw no enemy in force, but was chased by 8 mounted men.
