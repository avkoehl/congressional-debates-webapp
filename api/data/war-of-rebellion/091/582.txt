HEADQUARTERS,Cedar Creek, Va., November 9, 1864 - 9 a. m.

(Received 10.30 p. m.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

I am exceedingly anxious to get up the recruits and conscripts for this army. We have lost many men in battle and many by expiration of service, reducing my force very much. I will change my position from Cedar Creek to-day, taking position near where the Strasburg and Winchester pike crosses Opequon Creek. This point will be about four miles to the rear of my present position.

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS,Cedar Creek, Va., November 9, 1864 - 9 a. m.

(Received 10.30 p. m.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

I want the four regiments sent to Philadelphia returned to me at once. I sent a division of cavalry through Manassas Gap on the strength of the report of Rosser being at Leesburg. It will return to me via Ashby's Gap. It was reported here yesterday that the enemy's cavalry were moving, via Moorefield, toward the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, but I have not been able to satisfy myself of the truth of this report.

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General.

WASHINGTON, D. C., November 9, 1864 - 12.50 p. m.

Major-General SHERIDAN:

It is reported that the operatives on the Harper's Ferry and Winchester road are not sufficiently guarded. These employes will not work unless they feel safe from guerrilla raids. Please see to this.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

CEDAR CREEK, November 9, 1864 - 2 p. m.*

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

From all the information that the cavalry can obtain Rosser cannot be at Leesburg. Brigadier-General Powell, who is at Front Royal, has scouting parties out nearly every day beyond Manassas Gap, and if the enemy's cavalry have been moved down to Leesburg he would have known it.

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General.
