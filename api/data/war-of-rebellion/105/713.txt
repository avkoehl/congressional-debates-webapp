very warm in daytime. Distance previous, 64 miles; distance to-night, 15 miles; distnace in five days, 79 miles. The time is here called five days; that number of marches has been made, but the time between camps has been curtailed in order to travel by night hereafter.

October 30. -Left Indian Well at 5 p. m. for New River Station; road a perfect level, over a barren, alkali plain, with a few patches of mesquite; dusty and heavy for wagons. At New River, old mail station, deserted. Deep well of inferior water; a lagoon within 400 yards now affords a supply but would fail after a long spell of dry weather; it cannot be relied upon. This station is a precarious one for water. Weather very warm. Distance previous, 79 miles; distnace to-day, 15 miles; distnace in six days, 94 miles.

October 31. -Left New River Station at 5. 10 p. m. for the Alamo; road heavy, over barren flat. The Alamo is another old deserted mail station; there is a well thirty feet deep, affording a supply of good water. Animals can now make use of a lagoon, half a mile sxouthwest from the house. Within 350 yards of the house the road to Fort Yuma branches off to the left; the right-hand fork leads to the Mariposa ferry, thirty-six miles, and down the Colorado thirty miles from Fort Yuma. That route can be used to advantage by any one acquainted with the water lagoons, which are in thickets off the road and hard to find by strangers. Weather warm. Distnace previus, 94 miles; distance to-day, 14 miles; distnace in seven days, 108 miles.

November 1. -Left Alamo Station at 4. 50 p. m. ; road inferior. Gardner's Wells (old mail station, but water has failed), nine-miles; thence by same character of road and country to Salt or Seven Wells, and camped. Water plenty, but brackish; wood abundant. Weather warm. Distance previous, 108 miles; distance to-day, 18 miles; distance in eight days, 126 miles.

November 2. -Left Salt Wells at 4 p. m. ; nine miles to Cooke's Wells; first two miles and a half bad road. At Cooke's, water and wood good and abundant. Thence fifteen miles to Pilot Knob; camped on the bank of the Colorado at the foot of a mountain. From Cooke's the road is mostly good, through a mesquite flat, and latter part Indian gardners. Weather more pleasant. Distance previous, 126 miles; distance to-day, 25 miles; distance in nine days, 151 miles.

November 3. -Left Pilot Knob at 1. 30 p. m. ; road follows up the River Colorado to Fort Yuma, distance ten miles. Road a good deal borken first three miles and a half; reached the fort at 4. 30 p. m. Weather pleasant. Distance previous, 151 miles; distance to-day, 10 miles; distance in ten days, 161 miles.
