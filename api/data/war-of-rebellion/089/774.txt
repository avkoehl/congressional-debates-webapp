HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,December 1, 1864 - 8 p. m.

Brigadier-General WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

The following just received is forwarded for the information of the major-general commanding:
HEADQUARTERS THIRD DIVISION, FIFTH CORPS,December 1, 1864.

Colonel LOCKE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: Finegan's (Florida) brigade has been removed from my front. A deserter assigned as a reason the large number of desertions, some thirty-four having come into my lines since November 14. The enemy's line opposite my center has been still further retired, but not at other points, and from my observations to-day I think it is for the purpose of straightening it. The Richmond Grays are in my front. They will hold no communication whatever with our men, and are shy of exposing themselves.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. W. CRAWFORD,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,December 1, 1864. (Received 11.40 a. m.)

General S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Nothing unusual has transpired along our lines. Picket-firing continues through the night, but this a. m. all is quiet. Some portions of the line are in bad order and need repairing. This will be attended to as early as practicable. Two deserters, one from the Twenty-third South Carolina, one from Thirty-fourth Virginia, have been reported to these headquarters.

JNumbers G. PARKE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND DIVISION, CAVALRY CORPS,Jerusalem Plank Road, December 1, 1864 - 3.45 p. m.

Brigadier General S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: I have captured Stony Creek Station. The place was defended by infantry and cavalry, with artillery in strong works. I have 190 prisoners, 8 wagons, and 30 mules; burned the depot, about 3,000 sacks corn, 500 bales hay, a train of cars, large quantity of bacon, Government clothing, ammunition, and other stores. Captured two pieces of artillery; burned all the shops and public buildings. Colonel Gregg's (Second) brigade was in advance and took the station, which was most gallantly accomplished. I am now returning to my camps; my loss is very small.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

D. MCM. GREGG,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers.
