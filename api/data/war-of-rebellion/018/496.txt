WARRENTON, July 22, 1862.

Colonel RUGGLES,

Chief of Staff, Washington:

My acknowledgment of the order to mover Rickett's division, which you report as having been received by you at 4 o'clock, was dispatched from here at 1.30.

Captain Hodge, the quartermaster of Augur's division, a very intelligent, just, and observing man, has just passed over the bridge over Hedgeman's River-referred to in your telegram of this a. m.; reports that it is 50 feet long and 30 feet high. It is a strong and well-made trestle brigade. The only danger to it would be flood-wood in freshest. It may be replaced by a truss bridge, there being two abutments and two piers in good order.

IRVIN McDOWELL,

Major-General.
