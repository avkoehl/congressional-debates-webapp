Brigadier-General GARFIELD:

Everything was perfectly quiet on my entire front last night.

A. McD. McCOOK,Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS TWENTIETH ARMY CORPS, Chattanooga, October 2, 1863.

Major WILLIAM McMICHAEL,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

MAJOR: I have the honor to state that the headquarters of the Twentieth Army Corps are removed from the brick house on the hill to a position in rear of the center of the line of the corps, a short distance north of the main hospital buildings.

Very respectfully,

A. McD. McCOOK,

Major-General, Commanding.
HDQRS. FIRST DIVISION, TWENTY-FIRST ARMY CORPS, October 2, 1863.

General J. A. GARFIELD,Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: I have just returned from the parapet of the fort on my front, and cannot see anything in the movements of the enemy to warrant a conclusion as to his designs. The officer on watch reports the passage of sixteen regiments and two batteries along the crest of Missionary Ridge, from the enemy's right to his left [or reversely from our left to our right], but there is nothing sufficiently pointed in this to say what it means. Whether it is simply a change of camp, whether it means drawing off to strike somewhere else, or whether it means concentration against our right, other developments must tell. In the mean time we will watch them, and be ready for whatever, in the language of Mr. Micawber, may turn up.

Respectfully, &amp;c.,

TH. J. WOOD,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers, Commanding.

FORT DUNLAP, October 2, 1863-9 a.m.

Brigadier-General WOOD:

GENERAL: The camps on top Missionary Ridge appear to be broken up. Where the troops have gone to I cannot tell. They have not appeared in the valley yet. I can discover but little change in your front. In General Palmer's front it looks as if there was an increase of force, say a brigade.

Respectfully, sir,

J. L. YARYAN,

Aide-de-Camp.
