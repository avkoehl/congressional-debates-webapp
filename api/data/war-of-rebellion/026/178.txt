Swansborough, going as far on both routes as he may consider prudent, taking into consideration the threatening state of the weather, so as to join the main body by night or communicate with it.

By command of Brigadier-General Prince:

S. W. WALDRON, JR.,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.

I started with four companies of my regiment and one mounted howitzer and 150 mounted men, under Major Garrard, in the direction of Swansborough, which road intersects the road to Jacksonville via Snead's Ferry at Piney Green, 11 miles from Jacksonville and 13 from Swansborough. Halting at Piney Green I sent a detachment up the road to Snead's Ferry, 2 miles or more; they reporting nothing in that direction, I moved on to Swansborough, arriving there at 11 a.m., communicating with General Potter, at Hill's plantation, directly opposite Swansborough, through Lieutenant Fricker, the signal officer accompanying my command. General Potter immediately crossed to Swansborough in a small boat.

After remaining at Swansborough nearly three hours I took up the line of march and joined the left of the column, under your command, at the forks of the road, 5 miles from Young's Cross-Roads, at 5 p.m.

During the march we captured three Confederate soldiers, one a paroled prisoner named Caston, who was not yet exchanged; one by the same name who claims to have been recently discharged, and Private William B. Pringle, Tenth North Carolina Volunteers, who was visiting Swansborough on a furlough.

On my advance I captured several citizens, taking them to Swansborough, but returning them to their homes on my return. I ascertained by inquiries all along the route that the rebel pickets had left the day before for Jacksonville.

I am, general, with great respect, your most obedient servant,

G. W. LEWIS,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding Third New York Cavalry.
