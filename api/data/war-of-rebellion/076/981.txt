HDQRS. ROSS' BRIGADE, JACKSON'S CAVALRY DIVISION,August 20, 1864-8.30 a.m.

Brigadier-General JACKSON,

Commanding Division:

GENERAL: We came upon the enemy halted to feed, and have driven his rear guard from two lines of rail works. He is now formed, a brigade strong, on the hill at the far side of an open field some three quarters of a mile in my front, and has artillery in position and at work. We are on the road Leading toward McDonough, and from the direction the enemy has chosen I infer his raid be continued on farther down the country.

I am, general, very respectfully, &amp;c.,

L. S. ROSS,

Brigadier-General.
HDQRS. ROSS' BRIGADE JACKSON'S CAVALRY DIVISION,Mrs. Carnes' Gin-House, Ga., August 20, 1864-10 a. m.

Brigadier-General JACKSON,

Commanding Division:

GENERAL: The enemy's whole force has been formed near Lee's Mill, on the south side of Cotton Indian creek, and is now just commencing to withdraw. The direction they are moving will lead them into the Jonesborough and McDough road, about half a mile from Lee's Mill, but whether they will continue straight across that road to Lovejoy's Station, or will go on through McDonough, is yet undecided. their force is large. I have had a plain view of at least 4,000 formed in line. The road they are moving on intersects the Jonesborough and McDough road at Noah's Ark Church.

I am, general, very respectfully, &c.,

L. S. ROSS,

Brigadier-General.
