Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

Nothing has been heard from Sherman directly since the 1st. He then expected to reach Knoxville by 3rd or 4th. His force is full 30,000 exclusive of cavalry. Reposing full confidence in him and his command, I feel no apprehensions for the result, except as to General Burnside's ability to hold out until he reaches him. Dispatch from General Burnside on the 30th stated that the enemy had attacked him and been repulsed with great slaughter. His supplies were then still up.

Major-general GRANT,

Chattanooga:

I have sent a staff officer to Burnside, and by daylight will determine what to do. Elliott is not up, but cavalry must pursue and harass the rear. We have released Knoxville and will soon decide what next. A stern chase is a long one and especially by my advance, that have now marched 500 miles.
