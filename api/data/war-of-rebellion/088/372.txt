of yours if necessary. If you will have a roadway made around where I stated, I will send over a battery. On your north front I laid out the lines myself, thus;

Between A and b and between C and D I do not think any infantry should be placed. The battery at A should have the parapet A B so fixed as to fire also in the direction a e; that at D E, d a. I don't tell you this as necessary for your information, but to say I rely upon you to see that it is carried out. I think you can use Van Reed's battery, now between B and C. It might be withdrawn by you if necessary and cover that space by the infantry taken from the flanks A B and D C. I wish you on the front. I wish you to exercise the fullers authority and discretion, and do without consulting me, if I am not present, whatever you think best. I instruct our left in the same way to General Griffin. I will look out for the center and reserves. I believe Lee's army can't get us out of here if we fight well.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
