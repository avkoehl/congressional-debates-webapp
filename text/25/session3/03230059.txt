the sanction of their votes, if they disapprove it,
they can but reject it, and we must submit             |
But, su, the Senator from Kentucky [Mr
Cl&yj has referred us tuumphantly to his bill,
niuouuced some yeais ago, " to appiopriate.for a
hm ted time, the proceeds of the tales of the public
lands, of tne United States"—more familiarly
called hiddistribu'ion bill—afi conclusive evidence
of his fnendly regard for the mterest and píos
peiuy of the new States The Senator seems to
deploie the failure ot that measure, and to feel no
little astonishment that it did not conciliate our
appiobation
fc.li, 1 can assure the honorable Senatoi that, so
far as I have the means of judging, it was more
universally condemned by the citizen* of the
States m which the public lands lie, than any
other neasure affecting their mteiest which was
ever proposed He said some opinion of tne
estimation in which it was held, might be firmed
when the tact was known, (as he believed it to
exist,) that on the passage of that bill tin ough the
House ot Representatives, in Maicn, lto3J, there
weie but three votes given in Us favor irom all
the new States It must be .piesumed (he -.aid)
that the immediate representatives of the people
of that* ¡¡states knew pub Ik. sentiment m then
respective district', and that they voted m accord-
ance with it generally, aiwt¡ if so, how strong
was this evidence of their reprobation ' Yet the
Senator ficm Kentucky [Mi Cj  *] not only
persisted m maintaining that that measure wai
favorable to their mfeiest and welfaie, but perti
naciously endeavored, session aftei session, to
foice it upon them by ti e votes of the ref tésenla
tives of the old States i he mats oí every mteln
pent community is generally competent to loim a
correct opm on upon matteis winch concern ti in
own interest!, but tbe ben itoi fioni Kentucky
would not admit the capacity of the citizens of the
new States to )u Ige of the prooable effects, ot the
rrieasute he pioposed, but assumed the right to
judp-e for them
&n, regarding the probable effects of that meas
lire, it might have been mucn more ptopeily given
the title of " a bill to divide out tbe new States
amongst the old ones,"than that whicn was gtyen
it by its author The bill was reported by the
Senatoi ficm Kentucky, [Mr Clax,] not fiora
the Committee on the Public Lands, but fiotn the
Committee on Manuf ictuies, and it was much
bettei adapted to the mteiest of manufacturers
than that of agriculturists Its tendency was to
lender the aiquismon of land by the laboring
classes moie di tirult, and consequently to force
them into other em| ioyment than agnculture—
into the manufacturing esttblishments oi lai„e
capitalists in the States east ol the Alleghany
mountains, to obtain the slender means ot sub
suiting their families Yet,, su, its tendency was
to enhance the price of the public lands, and to
keep it up, so that they would have been attain
able only by the rich, to whom the poor would
necessarily have become an humble and dependent
tenantry
Why, sir, instead of a common interest in a
common fund to be derived from the sale of the
public lands, and paid into the general tieasuiy,
to be disbursed for tne general benefit, each State
was to be allotted a separate and distinct share
and interest To render the plan more imposing
and seductive, a table was appended to tne repol t
with this caption " Statement showing the div
' idend of each State (according to ns Federal
'population) m the proceeds of the public lands,
' after deducting therefrom fifteen percent as an
•additional dividerd for the several States in
' whicn the public land is situated " As the basis
of the calculation, the proceeds were estimated
at $sJ 000,000 annually—then about the highest
amount that had ever heen received in any one
year This taaie exhibited" to each State, at a
glance, the amovmt she was to receive from this
■source annually Por example, (omitting frac
t ons ) it shnwexl to iMew York that she would be
e ill led to $410 000 to Pennsylvania, that she
wou d be entitled to $285 000 to Virginia that she
would be entitled to «,218 000 to North Carolina,
that s' c would receive £13b 000 to Massachusetts,
that she would receive f 130,000, &c , <tc.   Su,
this exhibition was very alluring to State cupidi
ty, too much so to be resisted by some of them, J
at, least     Wl y, sn, ff 1 am not very much mis-
taken, the dividend which would  have fallen to
several of the States, would have amounted to us
much, or more tnan the total amount ot their ex   ,
pendituies for the support of tneir respective State
governments      They woulu have hid no need of
taxation for any State purpose, if Jen. to the fiee
anpropnation  ot   the  money       How  nauira'ly
would they have learned to rely on this Govern-
ment foi   the means oí support, and, having be   I
come accustomed to it, how unwilling would tl ey
have bee i ever to part with suJi a reliance    Ard, |
sn, the necessary result ot this separate merest •
would have been to induce tl e older Sutes to le
sist eveiy attemot to reduce the price ot the public
lands,  however inferior in quality—ay, and  to
stimulate them, extort fiom tbe inhabitants of the
new ones the iugnest possible prices., and every
d>llai they could taise     Would the older States
have been wn ng to have extended any liberality
t>   the ne*  ones,, undei   sucn   circumstances'
Would they have been willing to grant the light
ot prtenptlon to settler , who had lmpioved the
value ot new landb'    Oi, would they not rather
have raised  the puce, in order to incieaise the
amount of then  dividends     For the answeis to
tnese questions, 1 need orly refer you to the ordi
nary impulses of human mituie     No, sir, so far
from   reducing   the  puce of   infenoi   lands,  we
should, moie probably, have had the price ot un
cfieied lands increastd  by grauua iv\ to higher
latei than the existing minimum, we should, per
hips, have fust had .toilfied at five oi  ten do1
lais.as the minimum, for the se of the best quality,

would  thus 1 ive  been íetaided, and when then

would have been compelte ' to puchase at the in

Su, we have heard something said recently
about subsidizing the States, and bringing them to
the footstool of I ederal powei What more effect
ual mode of bunging about this ¡esult, than to
have accustomed the States to look to the Federal
Tieasuiy for money to supply their wants3 Would
not the tendency have been inevitably to make
the Geneial Government the tax gatheier foi those
of the State' Would not the State governments
have leaned insensibly upon this to fill then tieas
unes ' At d would not such a system, beyond any
other that could be dev ised, have led to ren 1er i •.

thebtates lithe S'atese uld be induced to become
dependent on the General Government, by an}
system of policy, this would most assuieüly lrve
biought it about
But, siii this i  mt ail Thedistnbution bill of
the Senator fiom Kentucky [Mr Ciayj involved
a violatnn of the compacts under whicl the pub
he domain was ceded by the Spates to the Geneial
Government Congress had  epea edly urged upon
the States having western ten ltory to cede it to the
Geneial Government, as well to promote the bar
mony of the Union, as to aid in tne payment of
the national debt which had grown out of the u ar
of the Revolution The several States having
western lands finally yielded to these aj peals, but
upon express «-ondittoiSj which were assen ed to
by the General Government No State ceded so
large a territory as Virginia, and she expressly
stipulated that the proceeds should be " a common
fund for the use and benefit of such of the States
as had become, or should become, members of the
Coiifediation," &c Geoigia used «ulvstsntially
the same language, and a clause followed, m each
act of cessio , that the lands ceued should be
' faithf illy disposed of foi that purpose, and for
no othei use or ptnpose whatevei " i hese aie
the termt. of the compacts, for trie perfoi manee of
which the faith of this Government is pledged
The proceeds are to be a "common fund," for the
use and benefit < f the whole Union—not for each,
nor any of the S ates separately Is oi could this
fund be legitimately expended, exceptupon ol jeets
within theconsutuuoriai powtrof thisGovernment
Now, sir,vvheie do you fmd in the Constitution
thepowerof Congress to appropriate money fiom
the com non Treasury to such objects as were
contempla'ed by the Senator's distribution bill'
It provided that the d stubutive shares of the sev-
eial States should be applied, by their respective
Legislatures, to " objects of education, internal
improvemen .colonization of free pel sons of co'or,
or the reimbursement ot any existing debt con-
tracted for internal improvement" before the pas-
sage of the bill
The  question   arises,  could   Congress  mak«
appropriations for such objects directly out of the
Treasury'    Whete will vou find  the powet   t>
' appropriate  money foi   pmposes of education >
I Wnere is the power of Congress to appropuate
, money to builj a national umveisity, or colleges,
I or academies '    If  any opinion  in favor of the
I exercise of such a power was ever euterta ned, i 
I has been long since abandoned     The only clause
in tbe Constitution that has the lemoteut relation
I  to the subject is that "To promote the piogtess
' of science and useful arts by securing, for limited
' times, to authois and inventois the exclusive
' ryhttotheinespeetive writings and discoveries "
And heie the manner of promoting th.e piogress
of science and useful aits is specifically laid down,
not by appropriating or granting mopey, but by
giving to authors and inventois, for limited times,
the exclusive benefit of then labors It cannot be
jretendeJ, even with plausibility, that Congress
can constitutionally make a direct appropriation
out >f theTieasury of the United S ates foi the
purposes of educat on is there any distinction
to be found in the Constitution be'ween that poi-
nt n of the tieisuie of t^e nation derived fiom
taxes' or customs, and mat der ved f'om thepubhc
lands as to the power of appropriation ' Is it not
a 1 one common fund, intended for common and
general purposes' On what ground can it be
denied'
In regard to internal impiovement, the provision
I of the bill intioduced by the Senator fiom Ken-
tucky   was without resluction or limitation      It
I did i ot limit the power of the several Legislate! es
even to the debatable class of national improve-
I m°nts, or those whiel) would facilitate the national
defense, or advance the geneial interests of the
nation      f he whole funu might have been applied
to objects of a chaiacter strictly local      Then,
waiving tne que? ion foi the present, whether mi-
ll pre v ementa of a national clrsracter be witlun the
II  competency of the Geneial Go einraent, it cannot
'   benmintai el t! at tl e prov sien undei considera-
tion   was   constitutu nal   in   thn toirt of   view
I Pu to make the o jection still m< e conclusive,

Cul, oirjthemosto'nectioralleof all theobjects

Le distubuted remans to be noticed    it was for
I the "colon ration of fiee persons of color "   This
I clause of  tie  provision  involved   consequences
j more sfuiousand al irming than all tl e othei s      It
was but the first sep towards the assurn; tion of a
