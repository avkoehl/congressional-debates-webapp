Captain MERRILL:

A rebel battery is seen on brow of Mission Ridge, on road running nearly east from this point in a pass about a mile north of the pass at Moore's house. It is supported by infantry, apparently a continuation of the line, which can be seen in General Crittenden's front at Moore's house.

September 22, 1863-5.30 p.m.

Captain MERRILL:

The rebels have stacked arms and are getting supper.

FORAKER,

Lieutenant, and Acting Signal Officer.

LOOKOUT POINT, September 22, 1863-6 p.m.

Captain MERRILL:

The rebel cavalry are massing on both sides of the Rossville pike near Mr. Hopkins' house. I think General Wheeler's headquarters are at the house this side. They have established a picket line up to the foot of the mountain, and will, no doubt, try us to-night, but we have made all preparations to receive them. If you will send and officer to the bridge on our right, near our batteries, we can give them all the directions they want for firing. Had there been one there to-day, we could have been of much service.

[A. S.] COLE.

SEPTEMBER 22, 1863-7 p.m.

Captain MERRILL:

A number of camp fires can be seen on top of mountain directly in front of General Crittenden, in gap near Moore's house. Faint lights can be seen along the mountain-top to right and left.

H. C. JONES,

Captain, and Acting Signal Officer.
