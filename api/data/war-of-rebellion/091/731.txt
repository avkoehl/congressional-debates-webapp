KERNSTOWN, VA., December 3, 1864-7.30 p. m.

(Received 7.40 p. m.)

Major General C. C. AUGUR,

Washington, D. C.:

Sweitzer reported to Merritt and returned. I asked you to send him via Leesburg on information from Stevenson which was incorrect. I had no special instructions to give. Keep the cavalry you have very active for a short time, and in the direction of Leesburg. Mosby may attempt to cross a small raiding party. There is also no doubt that an extensive contraband trade is going on from Berlin and points near there and as far east as Leesburg and that vicinity.

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General.
