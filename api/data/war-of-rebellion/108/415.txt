HEADQUARTERS,White Sulphur Springs, Va., December 19, 1861.

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant-General Confederate States Army, Richmond:

GENERAL: There is at this place a large supply of ammunition and other public stores left entirely unprotected, and as I am w ithout the means of sending the property to some safe place I respectfully request you will send such orders as you may consider necessary in relation to it. I have the honor to report 500 sick yet remaining in hospital, a large portion of which cannot be removed for some time to come. The country in front is left entirely open to the advance of the enemy should they desire to do so. Whilst writing I have received a dispatch from Major Sweeney, Sixtieth Regiment (whom I sent forward to Lewisburg yesterday with twenty men) infomring me that a force of the enemy has made its appearance at Meadow Bluff, fifteen miles west of Lewisburg. I have just ordered all my available force (twenty-five men) to support him. The people are greatly alarmed and complain bitterly at being left without protection. If I am to continue on duty here I respectfully suggest that a force be sent me sufficient at least to quiet the fears of the people and protect the sick and public property. If the Secretary of War will direct my regiment, the Fiftieth Virginia, General Floyd's brigade, to report to me at this place I feel confident with the aid of the militias I can give all necessary protection, and keep the scouting parties of the enemy at least beyond the Sewells. The counties of Greenbrier and Monroe are rich in grain and cattle, and it will doubtless be an object for the enemy to forage and supply themselves with provisions in these counties. There are now at this place vacant quarters sufficient for one full regiment; there are also provisions in depot to supply the same for three months.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. W. REYNOLDS,

Colonel Fiftieth Regiment Virginia, Commanding.

NOTE.-The greater part of the ammunition and provisions stored here are in charge of officers belonging to the Wise Legion.

A. W. REYNOLDS,

Colonel Fiftieth Regiment Virginia.

WHITE SULPHUR SPRINGS, VA., December 19, 1861.

Major H. B. DAVIDSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Floyd's Brigade, Newbern, Va.:

MAJOR: I have just received a disptach that a party of the enemy has made its appearance at Meadow Bluff, and have been committing depredations in that neighborhood. I have sent Major Sweeney, of Sixtieth Regiment, with a detachment forward, as far as Lewisburg, to quiet the fears of the people. They are greatly alarmed and complain bitterly of having been left entirely exposed to the enemy. There are at this place large quantities of ammunition and other public stores in a very unprotected state, and I have no means of removing them to a safe place should the enemy move in this direction. I have considered it necessary to send a letter to the Adjutant-Geneal on the subject, with full information relative to matters in this locality.* As the mails are so uncertain I have ordered an officer to carry my communication.

A. W. REYNOLDS,

Colonel Fiftieth Regiment Virginia.
