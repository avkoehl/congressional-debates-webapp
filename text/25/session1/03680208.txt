They should have made il long ago, and they ought

If this Congress should adjourn «ithout attempting a

Extract of a letter of William H Crawfoid, to William Jones,
Piesidentof the 33 ink oí the United Staler, dated November
29 1816
Fiom this view of the subject, as well as fiom a general
knowledge of the means with which the Bank of the Uaitetl
¡slates will have to commence us operation^ andol the difftcul
ties which it will have t > sin mount if the Stale banks ao not
make a simultaneous effort, it is manirest that wi hout then co
operation a national currency equal to the m lispensable tie
man is ot the community cannot he ubtame 1 by the 20th of

theexistm" legal provisions
Again—m the same letter he savs
' It is howevei, most aulently denned by the Government
that the necessity of leaortmg to lite is^ue ot Government paper
may be avoided by the íesump non of specie payments by the
State banks on oi befoie the 20th of Febm-iy next As an in
dure nent lo this measure the Government can onl) ai 1 then
operations by withholding fiom nicuhtioi as mi ch of th it

These vi ws of these tw o able and distinguished
men, expressed m the midst of a pressure moie
severe and infinitely moie alarming than the pres
ent ¿ue entitled to the grea est w eight It was then,
so it may now be tiulv said, tha this bill will not
l°qisUtle a roin ettnene / into existence, nor pm gold
and nhei into l/ie pockets of the people ' Its only
effirt wrll be to prolong the resumption of specie
payments, reduce and deprteiae the already re
ducedcuncncv of the country and um and oppiess
the people Sir if you would secure the resump-
tion ol specie payments w ithm a short time mstead
of crippling vou must encourage and support the
banks in their exertions to resume which we have
good leason to believe they aie honestly e\e ting
themselves to do They now only need a little
fuithei reduction of the foreign debt, (which piess
es on them so seveiely, but which is rapi llv being
leduced ) and the leslotation of the confidence ot
the Gov eminent to resume specie pav ments Tins
I do not doul t the y Mill be able to do by the 1st of
Apiil Let us onh imitate the examples, and
pr ictise the lessons of Crawford and Dallas and
all will be well, confidence will be restoied and
commeiee lesume its usual activity Evpii if the
scheme pioposed by the committee of Wavs and
Means were wise and piacticable it cannot be car
n d into execution at this time without mm to the
tvhol" mercintile community Until the -va tits of
the banks are unlocked bv the lesumption of spei íe
payments, specie in sufficient quantities cannot be
piocmed The attempt to enforte this law in the
pie en state of the metallic currency, would pro
duce unparalleled t-hstiess The maximum ex
chingis of the United Stales Bank m 1813, a
mounted to st3)1000,000 that (f the State Banks in
1830 to #331000 000 which pioves the capacity of
the State Banks, to conduct the exchanges of the
eonnlrj, beyond doubt Piomthe foregoing con-
siderations I conclude that there is no reason for
discontinuing the State banks as fiscal agents of
the Government, that did not equally exist against
then employment
Notwithstanding the fact, that the States fron
the foundation of Ihe Government have chattered,
and continue lo elnilei banking institutions, and
tins G iveipment has been m the uniform practice oi

In an\ ata:um°nt of mine 1 Ins question was de
tei mined directly bv <he Supreme Court of the
Un ted S'ales at its last session—a democratic Su
prcm" Court of which Riger B Tanet is Chief
Tnstice 1 will simply lefer to the able lucid and
unniswerable arguments of the judge the opinion
of the court in the casp of Buicoc vs tlie Common-
ibcalth of Kentuclii But it is contended b( some
mat it is equally unconstitutional to employ State
banks as fiscal agents, as to charter a national bank
I cannot see the force of tins very íecent objection,
there is a material difference between creating an
H. of Reps.
institution which is not authonzed by the constitu-
tion, and entering into compacts with corporations
which are created by governments, having the con-
stitutional power to create them, and imparting to
them the express power oí contracting I do not
perceive that, because the Government oí Ihe
United States cannot, by authority of the constitu-
tion, incorporate a national bank, that it therefore
cannot enter into a contract with individuals, which
it is daily in the habit oí doing The State banks,
being constitutionally incorporated and having the
power to contract, stand to the Government pre-
cisely in the same relation as individuals, who have
the power, and may conttact with the Government
Sir, I have been much surprised to hear an argu
ment so fallacious, so grav ely, and so earnestly
urged
I Villi now, Mr Chanman, call the attention of
the Committee to the scheme piesented to the con-
sideration of Congiess by the Executive, and offer
to its consideiat'on as briefly as I can, my objections
to it
The fitst objection is that it will be trying an ex-
periment, to sav the least of it, of very doubiful te-
sults My friend fiom Virginia (Mr Jones,) m a
very able speech a fe v days past seems to justify
embarkmg on this etpeti-menl, as he admits it to be,
on the grounl thpt the Government itself is but an
e\pei íment It is true that our system of Govern-
ment, when it was emeied upon, was but an experi-
ment, yet it "vv as a necessaiy om, and in its progress
has developed the wisdom of its adoption But
surely m" friend would not argue that because the
svsteip was onsmally an experiment, that it would
bo prudent to abandon that patt oi the s) stem which
has woiked well an\ adopt one which has no piac-
tical result to recommend it I regard it as the part
of wisdom to adhere to every svstem which ex-
perience has taught to be wise and salutary I am
suromv honorable friend would not be willing to
surrender oui admnable s3slcm of governmet t and
adopt another which had notmng moie to recom-
mend it than that it was an experiment The
system of bank deposites has been tried, and, al
though there have occasionally been some disorder
and clerangement, as there has been in all human
affairs, has generally worked M ell—so far as the
eipetiment now proposed has bad any practice, it
has been unsuccessful, and proved its utter insuf-
ficiency
The second objection which I present is, that the
public money will be unsafe and its effects demor-
alizing. The safety of the public funds is an lm-
jiortant >nattei, and shou'd enter deeply into the
consideration of Congress m the adoption of any
system which may be proposed We all know that
there is no system whuh human ingenuity and
sigacity can devise that would be entirely safe
Yet reason and cxpei icnce teach us that thei e are
some mote safe than others, and that which reason
and expei icnce teaches to be the most safe, should Le
adopted In view of this question of greater safety,
let the present and the system proposed be contrast-
ed Place if you please, the estate of any individual
who might be selected as the depositor and keeper
of the public mone}, by the side of the capital of
any bank which would in the exercise of a sound
discretion be selected, and how vast the difference
in favor of the bmk—compare the inducement
which the bank has to prtsetve its good faith and
credit, in a mere pecuniary point oi view, with that
of an individual, and how great the disparity in
favor of the bank—compare the fotce oi the moral
i filiation O" the part of the bank w ith that of the
individual, all the officers of the bank, the directors
and the stockholders are deeply interested mpie-
seivmg its faith with the Government and all other
depositors Under theproposed system a smglem-
dividual is interested—contrast, if jou please, the
means of detecting frend peculation and defalca
tion In the banks the officers are in daily watch
and check upon each other The directory hold
weekly sessions and superintend the officers, and
thesto kholders hoi 1 annual meetings and examine
and sciutmize into the conduct and management of
the whole—as to the individual depositor, there
would be onlj the Seeretai) of the Treasury, who,
residing at the seat of Gov ernment, w ould have but
little opportunity to detect defalcation and other
malversations But it is uiged by the President
that ample security may be taken which will re-
move all these objeclions Sir, whatever collateral
security j ou caji take of individuals, you can also
take of the banks, which leaves the question of
salety still decidedly in favor of the banks, the
