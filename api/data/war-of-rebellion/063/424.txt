and believing that we are justly entitled thereto, I suggest that if you can, without detriment to the public service, send us one company of troops, you will receive the grateful acknowledgment of our citizens.

Very respectfully,

W. W. H. LAWRENCE,

[Indorsement.]

FORT LEAVENWORTH, May 7, 1864

Respectfully referred to Brigadier-General McKean, who will do the very best he can in view of other pressing necessities.

FORT LEAVENWORTH, May 3, 1864

Brigadier General T. J. McKEAN:

A scout reports rebels may be camped at Mrs. Wilson's in neighborhood of Big Muddy, on county line between Henry and Cass. Troops sent from Aubrey and Coldwater Grove might find them. My information comes from a spy, who followed the trail down from Fort Scott, and is now at Trading Post. If you send troops report immediately.

S. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.

PAOLA, May 3, 1864

General CURTIS:

The party of rebels you mention were the same as reported before, and the scout thinks they may be at a point about 15 miles from Harrisonville (Mo.) Station, while our own troops are from 30 to 35 off, and would have to go easterly from the Missouri troops. I have seen the scout, and he has not been near the point yet, but surmised from other circumstances. Arrangements have been made for an expedition as you direct, but it will not start until you decide whether we had better go so near the Missouri troops without a mutual understanding.

THOMAS J. McKEAN,

Brigadier-General.

FORT LEAVENWORTH, May 3, 1864.

Brigadier General T. J. McKEAN,

Paola:

I have informed General Rosecrans of supposed rebel camp. Better send out a spy or scouts before sending troops. Use your discretion. Much depends on the foundation of the report. A mere conjecture should not have much attention. The scout should give the whole reason of his conjecture.

S. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.
