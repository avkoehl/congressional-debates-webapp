CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

It kaatnaa declared a violation of order lo speak here of t  „
Hou«e. of Representatives. Not so. It is, as it should be, out
éf order to allude disrtsptctfully to that body, or 10 any one of
its member*, not otherwise. Well.ihe resolution declares that
the PtenMlam of this, ani the 8  -aker ol die other, branch shall,
o  mvenday, and that not distant, adjourn, finally, their re-
apee i < Houses. The resolution is, therelore, a declaration of
the senate a opinion to the country—* declarauon to be made
now in advance, that the House ot Representatives ought to
transact all its business within a period named, not by the
House itself, but by the Sánala, and tbat period tar short of the
usual day of adjournment for the long session
It u proposed to make this declaration, although it be a fact
notorious, (of the reason 1 speak not,) that the House, so lar
from having acted definitely upon any oae ol the public mea
raras, which are admitted to be not only indispensable to the
general weliare, but some ol them to the very lite and being of
the Government—that it is not yei, as to one ot the States, even
an orgaiuxed body, prepared to act at all Are we then, is it
wise or just that we should, thus chide the House lor its tardi-
ness—thus prescribe, in advance, limits to its action—thus infer
delinquency in that body, by proclaiming our own prompt fide
luy lo the public!
But how stand matters with the Senate itself   Where are
the genera! appropriation bills? Where the revenue bills I Where
the graduation, the pre-emption bills)   Where that for the con
nnuauan of the Cumberland road)   Have these been acted
■pon, even here!   Have any one of them gone through the first
stage ts conaommatiool   And are Senators prepared lo ha
xara   these  measures, for the want  ol  time, by fixing an
adjournment   ao   unusually  near)      Borne  ol   these   bills
mnat   originate   in   the   House, before acted  upon   here,
and when,  in  the   existing   condition  of things,   can   we
expect them to come to the Senate?   We   sent to the House
the bill forth* defence of Florida, weeks ago, yet it still aleepa
upon the table—so we sent, and so sleeps the Independent Tree
sury—as likewise others of lees importance    If by any unto
ward «vent these measures be lost, where is the responsibility?
It falla upon the majority—the friends of tha Administration,
if indeed they be a majority    For, sir, whosoever may, in fact,
be the delinquents, the people.will, and ought to, ascribe results
to those who have the power to act, and to apportion responm-
tult y by the star.dud of numbers.   I say they ought, because
such is the theory of our Government—and this the only efTec
tive compulsion on majorities to do their duty    This is true of
bodies m the aggregate, although it is equally true that the jus-
tice of the people, in the separate States and disricts, will hold
their particular Representative likewise individually responsi
Me, if among the delinquents, notwithstanding they are of the
sa-nonty.
Again, the hank charters of this District expire, I believe, on
th; fourth of the coming July They have applied to this body
for a renewal—most be renewed this session, if stall, andas
yet, have not been put through even the first process Now,
sj, come np when they will, as come up they must, they shall
Hot, with my consent, be smuggled through the Senate without
discussion, for want of time to discuss them No, I am not
now to learn the character of the great contest which, at this
hour, so deeply convulses all parts of the country—a contest
involving principles which must in future affect most sensibly,
meet vitally, the very form of this Government—the safety,
the very existence of the Republic. Nor am I yet to learn
that our example, in this particular, will exert upon that con
at an influence, powerful f r good or for evil
Sir, my friend from Georgia, [Mr Lcmpkin 1 who introduced
Jsresolution, and those Senators who support it, are unquet-
-uoaabty sincere in believing the time sufficient, they are inca-
pable, I know, of being otherwise, but still I think with the Be
nator trom Kentucky, [Mr Clay.] that, though the resolution
may be passed, we snail nevertheless be found here engaged at
the ordinary period of adjournment. And, if so, will it not seem,
that, by thus fixing in advance a time so far short of that to
which, in the end, we aci ually extend the session, we have been
but sporting with the public credulityi I repeat, that I know
Senators incapable of Intending this, but it beco nes the dignity
—K is essential to the moral force of a legislative body, not
only to act in good faiih,wiih candor and sincerity in all thing ,
but to «ppearsoto act. |
' Jr After all, in the cot dition of the public business, not the num
i/ber of days, \  the rule by which to determine the adjournment
We are sent here to do that business, nor will the people, if we
adjourn and neglect it, excuse our delinquency, because we are
quick to prove ourselves delinquent They are j ust -they rea-
son justly; and they will approve or condemn, according to the
manner in which we spend the time, not to the time itself Let
us, therelore, work—faithfully work—and, being done, go
home Sir, I now speak sincerely my opinions, formed, as they
are, alone in reference to the public welfare, and have a right
to be thought sincere For who has neglected his duties leas—
who been more steady to his post than II So much so, indeed,
that I do not now remember an entire day, or a single vote, I
have lost since I became a member of the body—certainly no
vote of importance However hazardous mav be the question,
I neither dodge nor flee Let us, then do the work and go
home There, I am as anxious to be as any other Senator I
move, therefore, to lay the whole subject upon the table   1
Mr CLAY of Alabama, requested Mr Allen to withdraw
his motion to lay lhe resolution on the table, which precluded
debate; which having been done,
Mr C inquired whether the Senator from Ohio intended
certain remarks relating to " tricks," and "playing mounte
bank," to apply to him, or the course he bad thought proper to
pursue on this occasion
Mr Allen having disclaimed any such intended applica-
tion
Mr C expressed himself satisfied, and remarked that he had
•opposed the reasons he had before assigned, for supporting the
re lution, were sufficient to exempt him from any such impu
tation He said he had shown by reference to lhe last two ses-
sions, mat nearly all the business was done within the last
thirty days of each, and that about ihesame number of laws
were passed atihe short session of three months, as at the long
sessions, which had been for years growing longer and longer,
until they occupied seven or eight months This was
sufficient to satisfy him, that the public business could
be done «thin a more limited ume, and. if so, it fol-
lowed, max regarding economy, and the public interest, it ought
to be «one Nor was he afraid of the responsibility of bow
fixing a definite period for the session, when it was manifest suf-
ficient time would be allowed for the performance of all the ne-
#es«ary duties.   He said tf the pHbUe business was not done,
/
Sir
■r
the people of this country were sufficiently intelligent and discri-
minating to attach the blame to the pioper party, or the mdivi-
duaUjustly chaigeable with delinquency
But, Mr C said, he did not agree with the Senator from Ken
tucky,[Mr Clai ] m the reasors assigned by him for giving
lhe resolution his ¡>upport That ¡senator had said he was wil
ling to adjourn, because lie did not expect we should do any
good by leniainmg here, and that we should meet under more
favorable auspues at the next a sai >n. Mr C said, however
little prospect there might be of doing good by remaining in
session, judging from indications thus far, there would be abun
dant time, as he had shown, for the transaction of all the neces
sary business, if the two Houses would do their duty, nor
did he expect Congress would meet under very diffeient
auspices at the next session, than those of the lost ten or twelve.
He antnipated no change in the Administration, and expe-
rience hail satisfied him that defeat uid not change the character
of the Opposition He said he liad been accustomed to bear
these sanguine expressions of confidence in the future on former
occasions, and they did not alarm him Ab< ul the same period
in 1882. it was confidently predicted that we should have a
change of rulers at ih  then su ceeding session, yet General
Jackson was re elected by a moat triumphant majority Again
in 183C we were to be certainly defeated, and a Whig President
was to come into power Congress was to meet under new and
better auspices, but the monih-of November put an end lo all
these lond anticipauona, and the present Chief Magistrate waa
triumphantly elected to, said Mr C will it be again in next
November—be had too much confidence in the intelligence and
and patriotism of the people to believe, for a moment, that any
thing but another defeat awaited the Opposition, whatever con
fidence they might profess.
But, said Mr C we shall have the same opposition to en
counter then' as now Large as was the majority by which
General Jackson was elected in 1328, he encountered lhe most
determined opposition at the commencement, and throughout
his first term Though re elected by a greatly increased majo
rity, the opposition to his Administration continued with una
tated violence, from the beginning to the end of his second term
And, Mr C said, it would be recollected by all, that the present
Chief Magistrate was met by his enemies at the extra session—
the first afterhis election—and they had pursued him with un-
tiring perseverance and the most bitter denunciations ever
smce And so, Mr C said, it would ever continue, while those
who were out weie desirous to get m.
Mr ALLEN then renewed his motion tolay the resolution on
the table, which was negatived—ayes 19, nays 23.
Mr KING said he was as much in favor of early adjourn
ment as any other gentleman could be He bad many personal
inducements to desire it When the session was protracted far
into the summer, the sickly season had commenced in the sec
tton of country where he resided, and fothade his return until it
had terminated, and hence his anxiety for an early ad
joumment might be lnlerred but he thought the state of
the public business absolutely forbade them to move has-
tily in a measure of so much importance It was true
that, in short sessions, more business was done, in pro
portion to the time, than in long ones; but this was accounted
for to some extent, by the fact that in the House, the business
matured during the long session was carried over If a proper
disposition was evinced in the other House, it m ght be
prudent to fix a day, but could we shut eur eyes on the
condition of business there? and what had been sent to us from
that branch 1 Under this state of the case, would it be
expedient, or would it be acting discreetly, to fix the day al the
period named) He would move its postponement until Mon
day next, when more time would be had for reflection and
consultation, and he hoped that gentleman would accede to his
motion
Mr LUMPKIN expressing his assent, the motion was
agreed to
On monon of Mr KING, the lull regulating commercial inter-
course with the port of Cayenne, in the colony of Fiench
Guiana, and to remit certain duties, was considered, and ordered
te be engrossed
ABOLITION OF IMPRISONMENT FOR DEBT
On motion of Mr NORVELL, the bill supplementary to the
"act to abolish imprisonment for debt in certain cases," provid
ing that such act shall be so construed as to abolish imprison
ment for debt, or process issuing out of any court of the United
States, in all cases whatever, where, by the laws of any State,
imprisonment for debt has been, or shall hereofter be, abolish
ed," was taken up.
Mr NORVELL said that the act to which this bill was a
supplement, had abolished imprisonment for debt, or process
issuing out of the federal courts, only in those States wherr, at
the passage of the law in February, 1839, their laws had abo
lished it Such was the construction put upon it by at lt.ast
one of the courts, and a letter from a judge of the Supreme
Court, received by him, stated that to be the proper construe
t ion, according to the uniform derisions of that high tribunal
in similar cases He hoped, therefore, the bill would be per
muted to pas , by the indulgence of the Senate, to a third
reading at this time
The bill was accordingly ordered to be engrossed and read a
third time
The bil 1 for the relief of the heirs of Madame De Luster, and
their legal representatives, was ordered to be engrossed
On motion by Mr WRIGHT, the bill more effectually te se
cure public money in the hands of officers and agents of the Go
vernment, and to punish public defaulters, was taken up, and
made the order of the day for Tuesday, the 10th inst
The Senate then adjourned
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
Monday, March 9,1840
After the reading of the journal,
Mr AD4.MS said he did not discover, from the reading of
the record, that the motion he had made to reconsider the reso
lution offered by the gentleman from Tennessee [Mr Bell]
to suspend the operation of the treaty with the Winnebago In
dians, had been entered His object was to make the alteration
in lhe resolution which the gentleman from Tennessee had indi
cated he wished to make The resolution, in its present form,
directs the Secretary of War to do that which the House had
no powerto direct him to He would have no objection to the
resolution, as it was proposed to be amended, but in its present
form, he believed itto be unconstitutional Inasmuch as his
motion was not entered on the journal, he would now move to
reconsider the yote on Us adoption.
The question waa then taken on the meüou to reconsider, «nd
it was agreed to
The rtsolution aa originally adopted waa read, for which see
the proceedings of Saturday
The resolution, at the suggestion of Mr ADAMS, was then so
amended as to read as follows
Resolved, That it is exp> dient that all further proceed net in
the execution of first and second provisions of the 4th article of
, the tieaty of the 1st of November, 1637, with the Winnebago.
Indians, be suspended, and that, in the meantime, the Secretary
of Wir communicate to the House the proceedings of the De
partment had upon the subject- since the adjournment of the
last Congress, together with all the correspondence and other
information within his control, relative to the same, not Included
in his communication to the House of Representatives on the
1st of March last
Mr SMITH of Maine said he would like te hear from the-
chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs some reasons
showing the necessity of the adoption of the resolution
Mr BELL waa understood to say that the subject of this trsa
ty waa before the committee, and under consideration, and that
it had not been fully examined into He believed there ought
to be an inquiry into the whole subject before the treaty is exe
cuted, because there were some suspicions of fraud. The com-
mittee had not yet, as far as the examination has progressed,
discovered frauds, but they saw enough to warrant them in
asserting that the inquiry should be prosecuted further.
The question was then taken on the resolution as amended,
and it was screed to
Mr CAMPBELL of South Carolina, chairman of the Com-
mittee of Elections, asked the consent of the House to make a
report from the said committee in relation to the New Jersey
contest, for the purpose of having the same printed The re-
port, he said, embraced all the testimony laid before the com
mittee, prior lo the 5th of March, the time at which the pre-
vious report on the same subject was made, and was accompa-
nied by the journal of proceedings of the committee As it
contained all the papers, he hoped there would be no objection
to the reception of the repert
Mr STANLV objected to its reception
Mr CAMPBELL moved a suspension of the rules, to enable
him to present the report, and on that motion demanded the
yeas and nays, which were ordered, and were—yeas 95, nays 77,

So the rules were net suspended.
This being the day, under the rule, for the presentation of re-
solutions, the Speakbr called the States for that purpose, com.
mencing wnh the State of Kentucky Resolutions were then
presented, which will be found below
Mr GRAVES asked the consent of the House to fake up the
resolution offered by him on the 30th February last, (and pub-
lished in the Globe on the 21st,) in relation to E W Robinson,
Sroposini an inquiry as to the manner of his resignation, arc
ir G wished to modify his resolution by the insertion of the
word "January" in its proper place.
Mr ADAMS wished the gentleman would further modify his
resolution by striking out the word "corrupt," it shocked his
modesty
Objection was here made by several to the consideration of
the resolution
Mr GRAVES was proceeding to reply to Mr Adams by
stating that he had no particular desire that the word "cerrupt"
should be retained, but
Mr G was here called to order from all parta of the House
The SPEAKER said the consideration of the resolution was
objected to, and it was not morder for the gentleman from
Kentucky to debate it
Mr G was again proceeding to reply to Mr Adams, but was
called to order by several
The SPEAKER The gentleman from Kentucky is out of
order, and will be pleased to take his seat
Mr GRAVF8 The blackguards who «ailed me to erder
were themselves out of order.   He then took his seat
Mr COOPER of Georgia made ati effort to call up a resolu-
tion previously offered by hjm, calling upon the Secretary of
War fot his opinion and for facts in relation te the claims of
John C Watson' of Georgia It was now before the con -
mittee for investigation, and it was important to the claim that
the resolution should be adopted
Mr L WILLIAMS objected The committee which had
charge of tfie subject could call on the Department and obtain
all the information necessary It was not usual to call fer opi-
nions from the Departments in relation to claims, but for factr.
Mr RUSSELL presented joint resolutions of the Legtel. -
