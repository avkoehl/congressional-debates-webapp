~ From this table, based upon the census, it is
clearly established that there was a majority of
the actual settlers front the North in the Territory
in but three of the fourteen representative dis-
tricts. These were the second, fourth, and
eighth—electing in all but five members out of
the twenty-six.
But I cannot dwell upon these exhibits. No
man can gainsay the facts they disclose. They
are based upon the census, and the organization
of the districts by Governor Reeder; and these
two exhibits show conclusively to my mind, and
to all candid minds, that if the vote in
u Territory ,^ad been confined exclusively to
the actual resilient registered voters in February,
the result of the election would not have been
different from what it was! The census shows
thatthere were then a majority of 652 residents
Temtoiy from the South, over those from
the .North; and it is well known that great num-
bers of the emigrantstfrom the North voted with
the southern settlers against the Free-Soil party
at the .election, four of the members elected to
the Legislature, voted for by southern men, were
from the North. Mr. Banks, a member, of the
House, went from Pennsylvania; Mr. Water-
son, from Ohio; Mr. Lykms, a member of die
Council, waafirom Indiana, and. Mr. Barbee from
Illinois. These men, though emigrating from
the North, were members of the Legislature, and
belonged to what the gentleman styles the pro-
; slavery or "border ruffian" party in Kansas.
| The whole " Free-Soil vote, or "free-State"
' vote, as the gentleman calls it, in the entire Ter-
ritory on the 30th of March, amounted to less
than 800, as appears from the exhibits of the com-
mittee's report, (pages 31 and 32.) This is more
than 200 less than the number of emigrants from
the North in the Territory, according to the
census, and less than one third of the legally-
registered voters in February.
Now, as no witness swears that any man of
that party was prevented from voting, the whole
evidence taken together clearly indicates, if it
does not establish, the fact conclusively, that the
Free-Soil party in Kansas was largely in the
minority at the March election, and that all this
cry about an invasion, and the election having
been carried by Missourians, is nothing but
clamor. It is an after-thought. As to the state-
ment of old man Jordan, it is sufficient to say, in
reply to it, that there was no Free-Soil ticket run
at the election where he was, in the third district.
There was no reason, therefore, for any attempt
to keep him from voting.
-It is very possible, Mr. Speaker — it is even
; probable, and I do not mean to say but what it
is altogether true, that a great many illegal votes
were cast at the election. It is certainly admitted,
also, that great numbers of the citizens of Mis-
souri went into the Territory on the day of the
election, but there is no proof that any great
numbers of them voted. They went, according
to the testimony, to see that illegal voting should
not be allowed by parties sent out by the eastern
emigrant aid societies, barely for the purpose of
voting and returning. The main point, however,
I am now presenting is, that if every vote be re-
jected and cagt out of the count but those of the
actual resident registered voters in the Territory in
February, the result, upon all reasonable and ra-
tional grounds of calculation and conclusion,
would have been the same as it was. These views
are founded upon fixed and ascertained facts—
upon a registry of the legal voters, with the places
from which they went, and not upon loose state-
ments of one-siaed witnesses about the polls be-
ing crowded with strangers, and great multitudes
of people coming upon the ground in wagons,
&c. Why, Mr: Johnson (one of the judges of
election, too,at a precinct in the seventh district)
swears, on page 261, that " a great many of the
people in that district, whom he considered legal
voters, came to the polls in their wagons, I have
no doubt, as I came there myself in my wagon.
It is the habit of the people in the Territory to go to
gatherings in their wagons." And in this imme-
diate connection, too, he states, "and as a judge
of election, I am willing now to swear that we
allowed no man to vote that we did not consider
had a right to vote."
The tale told by all the witnesses examined by
Governor Reeder amounts to nearly the same
thing. They all had their " story pat." A great
crowd was assembled about the polls. Some had
guns, pistols, and knives. Well, sir, when and
where was there ever an election held at which
the people did not crowd about the pqlls ? And
is it not strange, that this army of invasion, with
flags, banners, and music—guns, pistols, and
knives, did so little mischief? Not a man was
hurt by them in the whole Territory! Not a
homicide committed ! Not even an assault and
battery about voting in the whole Territory! For
from all the testimony taken it appears that there
were but three or four fights in all Kansas on the
day of election; and these fights were not about
voting! Why, sir,in the municipal election in
this city, the other day, at one precinct alone,
there were half a dozen men knocked down—
some were shot—one has since died of the wounds
received in the affray; ahd one man,two or three
days afterwards, was killed in the streets merely
for hurrahing for his candidate! But in the in-
vasion and subjugation of Kansas on this memo-
rable election day, no man was killed—no man
was even whipped for, or on account of, his
voting! Strange invasion and subjugation was
that! A subjugation without a life lost, a bone
broken, or a bruise given, and about which no
complaint was raised until months afterwards!
And why, Mr. Speaker, was it got up afterwards ?
Why do we hear so much of it now? What is
the real cause of all this clamor at this time, in
this House and out of it, about the illegality of
the election of the Legislature in Kansas, and
these pretended grievances of a pretended down-
trodden majority there, crying out for redress
against a system of laws imposed upon them by
the people of a neighboring State ? I understand
it, sir, very well, and you, too, doubtless, under-
stand it. We all understand it. There is a party
in this country determined to " rule or ruin"—not
only in Kansas, but throughout the Republic. It
is a party formed upon geographical lines against
the warning in the Farewell Address of the Father
of his Country.
I may be permitted, in this connection, to al-
lude to this true and real cause of all these dif-
ficulties; for, but for this cause, I venture to say,
such a case as that now presented before this
House would not have received one hour's con-
sideration. The true cause, then, lies in no real
grievance in Kansas, but in the aims, objects, and
purposes of this party. They are against al-
lowing the people of the Territories of the United
States to exercise the right of self-government,
as provided in the Kansas bill. The elections
in Kansas did not go to suit that party. They
call themselves Republicans, and their republic-
anism amounts to about this: they acknowl-
edge the right of the people to govern them-
selves, provided they do it according to their no-
tions. They make loud professions, and utter
" shrieks" for the " freedom of the Africans"
amongst us, while they will not grant the free-
8om of making their own laws to their own
countrymen, of their own race and blood, un-
less it is exercised in conformity to their will.
These men were opposed originally to the Kan-
sas-Nebraska act, because it granted the right
to the free white men there to assign the negro
to that status, in their political systems, which
they, in their wisdom and patriotism, might
determine to be best for both them and him.
They wish to govern Kansas, not according
to the wishes of the people there, but as they
please.
Sir, I profess to be a republican of the old school,
of the school of Madison and Jefferson and
Washington. It was upon the principles of that
school 1 was in favor of the Kansas bill, and am
still; and I am in favor of adhering to it and car-
rying it out in good faith, both in letter and spirit.
I justify no wrongs that may have arisen under
it, if any have, coming from any quarter whatever;
and I am compelled to believe, from all the testi-
mony taken in this case, that whatever wrongs
may have been committed by any portion of the
people of Missouri, they were retaliatory in their
character. The first wrong was committed by
those whose sole object was to defeat the peace*
ful and quiet operation of the principles of that
bill. Whatever ills may have befallen these inter-
meddlers, have been clearly of their own seeking;
and we seldom see a man going out of his way
to get into a difficulty jvho makes much by it. I
am, however, sir, for applying all proper reme-
dies for existing difficulties, and for quieting all
disturbances which have arisen in Kansas, in any
proper and legitimate way. This I have shown
by my advocacy of the Senate's bill, which still
sleeps upon your table, and which you will not
touch: that is a fair and a just mode of pacifica-
tion. If pacification is what you want, that is
one way in which it can be accomplished. It
cannot be done by ignoring their laws, and voting
their Delegate out of a seat on this floor. It can-
not be done by making the President supreme
dictator over them. It cannot be done by with-
holding appropriations and stopping the wheels
of the General Government, and throwing us all
into anarchy, unless the wiH of a majority of this
House, upon the subject of African slavery, shall
be the law in that Territory. It cannot be done by
sixteen States of this Union setting themselves
up to govern not only Kansas, but the other fif-
teen separate and independent coequal States in
this Confederacy. It can only be done by leaving
this question, in some form or another, just where
the Kansas bill put it. This is the only ultimate,
