CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
And now we were asked to extend the time still
further for their indulgence Mr B also found
fju't with the wording of the bill,as not bemgsif-
liciently comprehensive in relation to the time when
the interest should commence to be paid by those
banks
Mr WRIGHT thought the wording of the bill
sufficiently clear, and rea t the first section to show
the meaning and spirit of the act
Mr. CLAY of A'abama thought it best to concur
With the Home ,n extending the time ft r the banks
and that the indulgence given in the bill would be
the besj relief to the people, and urired its imme-
diate com urrence
Some further discission took phce on the sug-
gestions of Mr. BUCHANAN, as to the meani g
of Una  of defm't, in which he was opposed by
Messrs WALKER, WRIGHT, CLAY of A ?ba
ma, and otheis **
Mi. WEBSTER then suggested an amendment,
to be appended to the end of the bill, in this shape
"And the default mentioned in this act, on
which interest is to commence at the rate of six per
ceil' per annum, shall he understood to be the
neglect or omi-sjon of said banks *o answer dra'ts
made oi them, according to the provisions of the
lust section "

The first business in older was the "bill im-
posing additional duties as depositories, m certain
cases, upon public efhceis "
The bill had been íeported from the Committee
of the Whole about half past \¿ o'clock last mght,
wthout amemtment, and the question was on con-
curring therein by the House
Mr WILLIAMS of Tennessee, moved to hy
the billon the table, but at the request of Mr
CtiRK of New York, withdrew it, for the purpose
of alording Mr C an opportunity of submitting
some íe marks
Mr CLARK then addressed the Chair as fol-
lows
Mr Speikcr I do not rise to discuss the merits
of ihe bill, orto express any cpin on in rela'ion to
to them I should have preferred that motion had
been made to pn,tp-ine is further consideration
until the first day ol the n xt session The sub-
ject matter of the bill is one on which theie is
among the friends of the administration, a diffe-
rence of opinio?!, and, I have no doubt, an honest
difference The gentleman from South Carolina,
a fi lend of the administration, in his remarks of
yesterday re retted that he sh >u d be called upon
at this time for final action on the bill. He pre-
ferred to wait until an opportunity should be af-
forded to him to ascertain the w ishes of his con-
stituents In these views I concur In voting
for the present motion, I shall do so for the same
reasons which woull influence me to vote for
a postponement until tne next session, consider-
ing the effects the same, neither of which deter-
mines the ultimate fate of the bill The vote I am
about to give will furnish no evidence of my opi-
nion as to the merits of the bid, or of my action on
the question of us final passage The Sub-Trea-
sury scheme, considered as an administration
me isure, is not el In 1835, it w as proposed by the
whigsm Congress, and recen ed the unanimous
and vigorous imposition of the democratic mem-
bers Whether i' is possible for the opposition

I repeat that this measure, as a demoTatic on e

enlightened to thaw ant conect conclusion of its
disposition If has not oeen to an> considerable
extent, the subject of dis'-assior, either m the so-

Ihe newspiprr press I don it wi e*her five coun-

Argus, the leading democratic journal m that
State, a jomnil which possesses great influence
ov«i the oountrj piess, had net, up to that period,

cumstances, it caí hardly be expected that resolu-
t oi s (.manating fiom county com enticns could be
considered as furnishing that evi ence of the pop-
ular will as they otheiwise would All the re-
publican conventions have expressed their appro-
