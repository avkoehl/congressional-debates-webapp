Report of Major General Henry W. Halleck, General-in-Chief, U. S. Army.
HEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY,Washington, D. C., November 15, 1863.

SIR: In compliance with your orders, I submit the following summary of military operations since my last annual report:*

* * * * * * * *

The detaching of the Ninth Army Corps to re-enforce General Grant before Vicksburg delayed somewhat General Burnside's preparations for an active campaign in East Tennessee. The necessity, however, of co-operating with the movements of General Rosecrans compelled him to take the field without awaiting the return of this corps. His main column moved on three routes, making Kingston his objective point, which place was reached on the 1st of September. Knoxville was also occupied on the 1st [2nd] by Colonel Foster, and General Shackelford moved forward to Loudon Bridge, which was burned by the retreating enemy.
