HEADQUARTERS MIDDLE MILITARY DIVISION,March 15, 1865.

Colonel THOMAS M. VINCENT,

Assistant Adjutant-General, War Department:

Where is the One hundred and ninety-fifth Pennsylvania? I would suggest that both regiments go to Harper's Ferry for organization, as it will be the simplest way. Have the four companies of the One hundred and ninety-second Pennsylvania already gone to Cumberland?

Colonel THOMAS M. VINCENT,

Assistant Adjutant-General, War Department:

The One hundred and ninety-fifth Pennsylvania Volunteers is at Kearneysville, between Martinsburg and Harper's Ferry. Unless the four companies of the One hundred and ninety-second are already at Cumberland it would be better to send both regiments to Harper's Ferry.
