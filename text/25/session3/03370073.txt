Senate.
this accounts for the strange state of things that we
now witness How have gentlemen arrived at thra
result' Not by reasoning, for that is not their
habit, but by instinct They know instinctively,
hir, that the stomach of the public sense will revolt
at any report coming from such a ssuice, and
hence their anxiety to have some Democrats of
their own election on the committee, to indorse
their statements on this floor, and thereby give
them credence with the public
I warn gentlemen that they cannot pack this com
mittee so as to deceive the people We have
shown them our ticket They know the n-mes of
the three out of nine whom the mends of the Ad-
ministration on this floor wish to choose They
have refused to belect these men It is not my
intention to impugn the character of the Demo
cratic gentlemen who have been elected 1 know
them to be capable and honest and I further know,
sir, that they will not serve unlebS compelled by
a vote of the House
Mr PRENTISS here rose, and interrupted the
gentleman from New York
Mr MOORE refused to yield the floor
Mr PRENTISS said he wished to make a
point of order
Mr MOORE I debate no questions of order, it
is not my habit Gentlemen are welcome to the
floor

SPEECH OF HON R WILLIAMS,
OF WAIVE,
Ix Senate, Jinvaiy 29, 1839,
On the motion of "VIi   BtM-ox for leave to intro
du<e a bill foi the repeal of the Salt duty and
Pishing bounties
Mr "WILLIAMS said
Mi President lhe bill which the Senator
fiom Missouri proposes to introduce, has for its
object the repeal of the duty now imposed upon
salt, and the abolition of the bounty granted to
vessels employed in the cod and mackei el fishery,
and I regret that the Senator has desired that the
vote upon granting leave to bring in this bill shall
be considered as a test vote, that those voting for
granting the leave shall be consideied as fnendly
to the passage of the bill, when introduced, and
that those voting against it shall be consideied as
opposed to its pa sage By this course the hen
ator has the advantage of appearing before the
nation as the mover and advocate of a proposition
to leheve the people from a tsx upon salt, while
utheis, willing to go further than this bill proposes
to go, may be represented as unwilling to do any
thing toward removing any of the binder:, nn
posed upon the community For myself, I would
gladly vote to grant the leave to bring m this bill,
in the hope that, in its progress, othei articles
might be included, the tax upon which is more
oppressive, and more unequal m Us operation
upon the different portions oí the Union, than is
the tax proposed to be repealed by this bill If
the honorable Senator had n eluded in his bill the
articles of coal, breadstuff, beef and pork, iron,
sugar, molasses, and lead, and proposed to repeal
or modify the duties upon them as well as upon
salt, he should have my vote, but as he chooses
to confine his bill to one article, viz salt, and has
coupled the repeal of the fishing bounty with the
repeal of the duty upon salt, 1 must vote against
it for reasons which I intend briefly to state
And here let me ask, Mr P esident, why it is
that, at this short session, and at this advanced
stage of it, we should be presented with a bill to
repeal the duty on the single article of sal', and
leave the duty upon all other articles untouched '
and why the Senator from Missouri should feel
himself called upon, not only to introduce the bill
now, but to announce his determination to devote
himself, fiom this time forth, to the abolition of
this execrable tax, as he cal's it > Have we heard
fiom the people any complaints of the tax upon
salt' Are theie any petitions asking foi its re
peal ' Have the Legislatures of any ot the States
asked for its abolition ' Not one Does this tax
operate more severely upon the State which the I
honorable Senator so ably lepresents, or upon
the entire West, than upon other portions of the
Union' So far fiom this being the fact, the re
verse of it io true, and why' Because the west
ern country is blessed with salt sorings, from
which most of the salt consumed m that rortion
of the Union is manufactured at home, and the
i domestic article is cheapei than the foreign salt
I can be transported to them, even if there was no
duty upon the article, and probab'y cheapei than
tne cost of transportation from New Orleans, if
salt could be had there for nothing It may be,
and probably is, true that foreign salt is required
and used in the West to cure then beet and poik
intended for expor atio 1, but this constitutes but
I a veiy small paitof the whole consumption of the
vast West It is not so with the Atlantic Stites
they have no salt springs near the sea board,and,
although they manufacture some salt, it is still
true that most of the salt imported from ab-oad
is consumed in the Atlantic States and m the
fisheries If this be so, and I submit to the Senate
if it be not so, why, 1 ask, should the West be
fiist to move in the business of abolishing the
duty upon salt' If they regard the duty upon
salt as a buiden upon them, should they not be
willing to consider that other portions of the
Union bear equal and greater burdens' Nay,
moie should they not remember that they have
an equivalent, and moie than an equivalent, in
the tax upon breadstuff's, upon beef and pork,
and upon lead, all which articles they produce
m abundance, and sell to other portions of the
Union at an enhanced price in consequence of the
duty upon them ' If they wish to have their salt
fiee of duty, let us, who are obliged to purchase
breiistuih, and beef and pork, have these am
cies fiee of duty, also, or at such prices as those
articles would be sold at if they were free Why
sho lid the surplus produce of the We t be pro
tected by heavy duties, and thus enhanced in
price to the consumers in other States' There
can be no reason for it unless it be that in the
general anangement of the tariff other portions
of the Union have an equivalent in bein  favored
in their productions But would the removal of .
the duty on salt be felt at all by the western I
States Not unless the price of salt would fall in
consequence of taking off the duty, and that such
would not be the fact is fauly to be inferred from
the experience which has already been had by
the country while the tax has been in the process
of reduction, and the prices of the article not
affected by it, as has been shown by the honor- ,
able Senator from Massachusetts If, then, the |
West have no burdens to complain of, and in fact
do not complain of the duty upon salt, so far as
Ooi ¿ress are informed, by petition or otherwise,
I ask a^ain, why it is that ti e Senator fiom Mis
souri should bring his gieat powei and talents to
bear upon the sma II remnant of tax, now less than
six cents per bushel, npoi silt' The Senator
says it is an execrable tax—a curse and an abom
mation—i tax upon the beneficence of God It
is true tint salt is an article of necessity, and
used as much by the poor as oy the nch, and
hence snould be aff rded at the least possible
cost, but how it is that the Senator should put
all the horror and detestation which he manifests
and expresses on this occasion at the small rem
nant of tax upon salt, and at the same time
forgets or omits to mention other aitides of
equal necessity to the poor and to the nch, and
much more important in respect of the duty or tax
upon them—I mean breadstuff^, beet, pork, sugar,
iron, coal, &c , I am at a loss to understand It
cannot be that he does not esteem them of equal
necessity and general use, oi that the tax upon
them ¡s not greater than the tax upon salt Why
are not the duties upon all and upon each of these
ai tides execrable, a curse, and an abomination, a
tax upon the beneficence of God' The Senatoi
does not, and I think cannot tell us, and yet in Ins
bill he does not name one of them, nor in his able
speech does he intimóte an intention of relieving
the people fiom any portion of the existing duties
upon them If these arteles, or even a pait of
them, were included in his bill, I would rejoice to
see it introduced and acted upon Then my con
stituents, as well as the Senator's, would share m
the benefits of passing such a bill     But his bill
l proposes no such thing it provides simply for the
repeal of the salt duty and fishing bounty, for the
benefit of his constituents, and thereby taking from
mine the only item m your whole legislation which
goes, in any degree, to compensate my section of
country for tne most guevous and unequal opera
tion of the present tariff and here, as in the decla-
ration of the honorable Senator, that the fishing
bounty went to the benefit of a pat lindar section,
and that he looked for opposition to his bill fiom
that section, must be found the motive for brirgmg
forwa-d this bill at this time, and pressing it with
so much pov. er and perseverance With this im-
pression, it becomes my duty to lesist the attempt
to produce such great injustice to my constituents
as would follow from the passage of the bill now-
proposed In a country so extended as is ours,
embiacing almost every climate, and engaged m
such a vauety of pursuits, it is not to be expected
that duties upon articles will operate equally upon
the pursuits and business of our cui/ens in dif-
ferent sections of the Union, and while atax upon
one article may, as it often does, be borne princi-
pally by the men and business of the East, and
i have little or no practical operation in the West,
a tax upon some other aiticle may be borne pnn-
' eipally by the West, and ha\e very little influence
oi the business and prospeuty of the East   Hence
I it is that the business or forming a tariff is and
ought to be the result of comparison, equalization,
and compromise, in which the various interests
and pursuits of ail parts of the Union shall be duly
respected, and the necessary burdens for the sup-
port of the General Government be so distributed
upon the vauous sections of the countiy, as to
come as near as possible to equality as a whole
We now have a tariff of duties which, I admit, is
very far from being just or equal in its exactions
and impositions upon the several sections of the
Union, and bears most oppressively and wjuu-
ously upon the business and pursuits of those
whom I have the horor, in part, to represent Still
as the bounty to fishing vessels is the only equiva-
lent, and that a very imperfect one, for the severe
and ruinous taxes upon our most important branch
of business, it must be apparent to every libera'
mind, that, if this boon be taken away, some of
the burdens bearing peculiarly hard upon the peo-
| pie and business of my State should fall with it
By the compromise act, as, it is called, the dutieb
upon all articles are in process of giadual and rapid
reduction, and in 1849 the tax upon salt will have
comedown to two cents pei bushel, oi theieabouts,
and it seems admitted on all hands, that the time
is near when the whole subject of the tariff must
be considered and adjusted I he sooner the better
for my State, and I will go with the honorable
Senator fiom Missouri, at any time, for a general
re-vision and modification of the tariff, for the pur-
pose of equalizing the public burdens upon all the
States but not now, or at any other time, for
taking any one article separately, whereby the
burden upon an oppressed poition of the country
should be made more ruinous Then, again I ask,
wl y not suffer the Hx on salt and the fishing
bounty to lemam until a general revision of the
tariff'
1 he honorable Senator says that the bounty to
fibbing vessels lb an unconstitutional use of the
public money My answer to that objection is,
that it was granted under Washington's admmis
tration, and has been continued under eveiy suc-
ceeding .Administration to this day, with a short
interruption under that of Mi Jefferson and it is
leasonable to suppose that the framers of the Con-
stitution, and the wise men in the Government
from the adoption of the Constitut on to thio time,
unders ood what was and what was rot consti u-
tionai, as well as tne honorab'e Senator, and I am
content to put their opnuoi sand their acts against
the opinion of the Senator fiom Missouri But to
test this objection by the acts of the honorable
Senator, I would ask how he can contend that the
bounty to fishing vessels is unconstitutional when
he advocai.es and votes for bills to grant lands in
aid of the construction of canals and ra Iroads to
authorize States and incorporated companies to
impoit rai'road non free of duty, and to authorize
a diawbacc of du íes upon such noil upon proof
that u has been used in construction of railroads'
Is there any principle upon which such gratuities
