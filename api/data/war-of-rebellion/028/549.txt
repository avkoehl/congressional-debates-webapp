HEADQUARTERS CHIEF QUARTERMASTER, Camp Rectortown, November 6, 1862. (Received November 7, 9.35 a. m.)

General MEIGS:

Supplies of subsistence and forage should be forwarded to this army at convenient points. The supplies should be help in readiness in cars, on sidings, at Manassas, so that the trains can be started to any point required at a moment's notice. We require at least one large train of supplies at Salem immediately. It is expected that the amount ordered by General McClellan some days since is now near here. We shall require an equal amount on the 8th at Warrenton or at the Junction. I request that you will order all the cars that can be obtained shall be leaded with subsistence and grain, and be held in readiness at Manassas, subject to move on orders from these headquarters. General Haupt reported to General McClellan that the road can transport 700 tons daily. If such is the fact, we will not suffer, but the road must not fail us. Please have the road put in repair from Aquia Creek to Richmond, via Fredericksburg.

His Excellency the PRESIDENT:

The Manassas Gap Railroad is in such poor running order that I shall be obliged to establish my depot for supplies for the whole army at Gainesville until the Orange and Alexandria Railroad can be repaired beyond Manassas Junction. I am now concentrating my troops in the direction of Warrenton, and have telegraphed General Haupt to repair the Orange and Alexandria road to the line of the Rappahannock as soon as it can be covered by our troops. The storm continues unabated.
