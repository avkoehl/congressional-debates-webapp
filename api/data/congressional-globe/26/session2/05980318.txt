26th Cong....'2nd Sess.                                       Election of Sergeant-at-arms.                                                                       Senate
a correct understanding oí this matter, beyond that,
he knew it was useless to talk, for tha fiat had gane
forth. Be it so let the gentlemen proceed to the
election, and then let the country judge whether it
was a little matter or ? great matter "Straws
shows which way the wind blows "
Mr SMÍTH cf Indiana said, it seemed to him
there were two sides to the qae^tnn. The Senator
from Alabama supposed the objsct was. to make a
place for a favorite, but what had that gentleman's
party done? They (the ¡ate majority) had the
power, and what did they do m this matter? Not-
withstanding they did not fill this office—notwith-
standing the Daorkeeper agreed to discharge the
duties of the station for this session—and notwith-
standing the amount given to lie widow of the late
Sergeant at-Arms—from 'hat quarter came a mo-
tion to give to the acting Sergeant-at Aims $1,000
extra, for about six week'  serviee in discharging
tbe duties of that office He did not charge it on
the Senator from A abama, bat it came from over
the way, (from the Democratic s de of the t.ou>e )
That motion was modified, giving $500 extra for
the discharge of the duties which the Sergeant at-
Arms should have discharged Then, as a matter
of economy, it th  office is not filled, a proposition
will come hereafter to give the Doorkeeper the
same pay for the discharge oí the duties of the
Sergeant-at-Arms Had not the opposite party
laid down that principle, and in the case of Attor-
ney General Butler, where one officer performed
double duty, had ihey not paid double fees? Had
they not laid down fae same principle in the identi
cal case before the Senate? He (Mr. Smith)
voted against the allowance, but when the gentle-
men opposite told him that this office should not be
filled on the «round oí economy, and by their ex-
ample they showed him that they ga /e the pay, the
charge of want of economy, as applied to him, lost
itself But to return to the question Hire was
an office vacant, should they fill tt and havt> a re-
sponsible officer, or should they aeree to give the
same compensation, by way of extra alio vanee, to
those who were fil mg mfenoi stations without the
responsibility? This was the giound on which
he should give his iote, and the gentlemen oppo-
site could no'expect the argumeat ot 'economy"
to have much weight on him They (the Whig )
had just as much right to charge th  gentlemen op-
posite with wishing to keep th s office vacant, that
they might pay an officer double, nt they had to
charge back upon them (the Whigs) an appo n -
ment with compensation, wnere theie were no du-
ties to be discharged But if there were no duties,
why did not the gentlemen opposite discharge the
Doorkeeper? It was not a question whether there
were duties during the vacation or not, though he
had been willing not to fill the office
Mr. KING So you were, but _,ouarenotso
now.
Mr SMITH woul 1 t< 11 the gentleman why As
the matter now stands, he was wil'mg to give his
vote for the appointment of a Sergeant-a'-Arms,
rather than have inferior officer* remunerated by
extra compensat on, for the discharge cf duties of a
responsible office
Mr KING wished to correct a statement of the
Senator from Indiana, made in the cours" of his
remark  on this subject Tftc proposition to give
«Xtra comp tiiatioti did rot fine from that side of
the Senate, it the honorable Senator meant the De-
mocrat   s de
Mr SMITH replied that the proposition eime
fromtne Senat r from ¡vtis'-ouii, [Mr  Bfntin ]
Mr KíNGr «a d ihe proposition of theSenuor
from Missouri was 'o n - a regular cornpenspu *>,
and thereby to g>t net if the ' extras " Hi. (Mr
Kino) suggest; d tb  p-i priety of <uehacours ,
and his friend from Ml souri introduced a proposi-
tion to that effect, and it ws sent to the G mmit-
tee on the Contingent Exnerse, of the Senate, ?nd
subsequently, Gjvemor Kni°tii, who was nu now
a member, but woo was ds \ tnh i man as ever
occupied a seat on tb",t fl >or, rep(.rt d from that
committee ths propou'i >n to giv  t1 e rxtra allow-
ance to the Doorkeeper. He (Vlr King) knew
just as much about these things as the Se ia oí rom
Indiana He had been her" sorae years, he had not
been inattentive io passing events, and he had seen
that the cout*s which had been pursued in relation
to compensating their officers, led to difficult es
He had hoped a fixed compensation would be
agreed upon L t it be liberal, let i' be per-
manent, ard lei them, thereby, get rid of ex-
tra compénsanos But it was thought imprac-
ticable by the committee to fix a compensation
that was just and right, and when the allowance to
the Doorkeeper was proposed, who objected1 His
friend from Mississippi [Mr. Henderson] objected,
and his friend from Arkansas, [Mr Sevier,] he
believed, and one or two more, but it passed by al-
most unanimous consent Six was the precise
number that objected, as th  af es and noes would
show. Well, now, of these how many were of th 
other side? Only twi—the Senator from Indiana
and the Senatoi from Mississippi—and four were
en this side, and this was to be the groundwork on
which the gentleman would fix ther vindication of
this election when there were no duties to perform,
unless the n"W Sergeant at aims came here and
did the duties to-day and to monow. He repelled
the remark of the Senaror from Indiana, that they
wished to keep open an office, that they might give
additional compensition to another individual
That individual was entitled to no extra compen-
sation
As to the extra session, it appeared that they had
to go to Richmond for their information If
the extra session were to be early, the State he
represented would be without representation m
the other House, and he had been, therefore,
desirous to know when, or whether an extra session
would be held, but hitnerto he could get no precise
information, but now they got it from th  S nator
from Kentucky, who got it (rom Richm md, though
that Senator had told them m the early part of the
session that there would be one He (Mr Kino)
had not doubled it tnen, for he took it the Senator
spoke with authority, yet he had ma ie inquiries of
Mr Ewmg of Ohio—a gentleman of great respec-
tability, but of different poh ics from him (M"
Kino)—who piomised to give him the earbest inti-
mation of the period fixed upon, which he had not
yet í'onB. However, it was said that they were to
have an extra s'ssjon, ard they mu*t 'herefore go
into an elec ion of Sergeant a'-arms, that that offi-
cer might make him«elf acquainted with his duties
Why this was really laughab e. What had
he to do? Was it necessary that he should
study three or four months to learn to keep
all persons out of the Sena e except such as
were enumerated on the rules at the door'
Had he to go through a long course of studies to
learn that the galleries were not to mtrrfcro wiih
tie deliberations of the Senate? These were the
studies of the Sergeant at Arms' Bjt heft the
was merely wasting the time ot the Senate, and he
would only say that he should vot  pgamst (Ir-
resolution H- cared not what the political senti-
ments of the Sersreant-at Arms, or any other officer
of the Senate, might be, he had rarely a ked him-
self the question, and on one occasion when he
had labored, with more than ordinary zea', to get a
worthy but unfortunate man elected uVre, the
man sud to him, "I owe it to you frankly to say,
that I am an old Federalist " He was elected, and
to the b"st of his ability did his auty, until he fell
dead in yonder room, while engaged m their ser-
>ice
Mr SEVIER hoped the Senate would not pro-
ceed now io this pro msed election He had been
struck with some suipris  at the remarks ot the
Senator from indiana, [Mr Smith] Ihe position
of the genti man opposite was that they (the late
majority) hid been in the habit ff voting extra pay,
and therefor the o'ier si Ie were dispo-ed to fol-
low that sn endid exam >!e. B i< th's gentleman
need not tell him tins s'o-y for al hou°h tie gen-
tlemen opptsite bad cried "reform," he kne'v
when it came to the test that it would turn out to
be "humbug" Tney saw it th  other day, when
fivi ig the coiiner-ii'ion of nostma-tei's ?nd collec-
tors, ^.nd now they s %w it again Yes, while th°y
had the cry of ' retrenchment' and "reform" still
in their ears—while they had the flag of "reform"
flying across the Avenue, they bad this commen-
tary on that profession of "reform." He had
hoped that the example of the late Administration,
if it was as extravagant as it had been represented
to be would not have been followed, but that the
new Administration would have taken a new and
different direction, be it better or worsp But to the
salary of this office, which it is now proposed to
fill. Subsequent to the death o" our late Sergeant-
at-Arms, a Senator from Vermont, [Mr Phelps,]
moved, no doubt, by feelings which are highly
creditable to htm, introduced a resolution propos-
ing to give to the widow of the deceased five hun-
dred dollars to defray the expenses of carrying the
body to Vermont was for interment. This amend-
ed at the suggestion of the Senator from Indiana,
[Mr White,] by adding to the sum the amount of
salary for the whole time for which he was elected
—two years This resolution was agreed to, and
pgreed to on the understanding that the present As-
sistant Doorkeeper would discharge the duties of
the suuation for the present year. They voted this
money, and it was paid, and the Democrats ma-
jority—who are so frequently taunted for their
recklessness, by gentlemen on the opposite side—in
accordance with the understanding, made no at-
tempt to fill the office, though they had the power
But it was said they wished to keep the office ope>i
that ihey might vote extra allowance to another
individual for p rforming double duty, but if he
got extra compensation, who would give it to him?
Are you not the majority, gentlemen Reformers2
and if he gets extra pay at the next session, will he
not get it at your hand*, and not at ours? He
(Mr Setier) only viewed the proposed d sposal
of this matter as part of the system to be hereafter
pursued, and as an exemplification of Ihe purposes
ot tbe "great Reformers" of the last few months
He «aw no earthly reason why th s election should
not be pos poned unt 1 the meeung c f the next Con-
gress Tne business of the Senate was nearly over,
and if we elected the officer, he would have no ser-
vices to perform during the recess—except, per-
haps, the removal of the carpe s, and that might be
safely entrusted to the Doorkeeper
Mr. BENTON believed it to be very proper that
this motion should be postponed urtil the second
M mday of the n xt session Propriety and the
existing law b th required it He had beei thers
long enough to be cotemporaneous with tne enact-
ment of the law, which had been read for the go-
vernment of this body, and he knew the reason for
its enactment. With resptct to the rule, and the
practice under it, of this side of tbe House, he
knew all about it, and the reason for its adoption,
and the reason why it had never been departed
from, from the time ot i s adoption to the present
This office, wbi h fiey \\ ere told was necessary to
be filled, to enable them to conduct tneir business
with r gulanty, had a sufficient a traction in it,
from the amount of salarj, the easy nature of the
duties, and the re pectability of th  station, to very
many persons The office of Secretary to the Se-
na e, the Sergeani-at Arms, and the Doorkeeper,
had all sufüci nt attractu ns, m their salaries, and
duties, and stations, to make ihem desirable to ma-
ny persons Tne office of Sergeant-at Arms, he
corsidered more desirable than any other in their
gift, it wa-. an office which carried along with it
not very laborious duties for any period of the
year but the sunervision over others, and to see
that they did their duty Wh n the session was
over f-e dun s of the S igeant-. t-Arms ceaced, and
until ihe ensuing session there were long vacations,
dnrmF which be received h s salary, while attend-
ing to his own bJsmps , or travelling wherever he
pleased One yacjtion was i f nine months' dura-
tion, during which h s dunes entirely ceased, in the
short vacat on he had sit months It was then an
office that was d sirab'e to a great number of per-
sons—to men of some age, men who had rendered
service to their co intry, nerhaps in the field, perhaps
m the councl bat win hac now re urned to pn-
late life and who needed the advantag°s which a
sa'arv would bring, and they round m the duties of
S  geanr-a'-Avms a place that would suit them in
every resper t, and the Sánate had seen among
those who had applied for it, persons of great
respectability in the coun'ry— ome who have had
seats in the House of Representatives Seeing,
then, the resoectabibty of the office, and the great
many that applied for it, it was necessary that a.
