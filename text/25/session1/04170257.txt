APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
mainuig deposite m tne Mint to the cuuent expen-
ses of the Government, w pay, in good faith, to its
creditors, without discrimination, the full value oí
their just demands, instead of putting a part of
them off with the depreciated paper of those banks
whom his policy has contributed to break, or w ith
Treasury drafts, which, when issued, he very well
knows, will be protested i
• Leaving a few thousand dollars m the Mint, for
the purchase of copper bullion, according to the
former usage of the Government, if the views
which I have presented to the committee be correct,
$750,000 of the sum remaining m the Mint may be
added to the estimated resources of the present
year; and an entire million deducted from the pro-
posed charge upon the Treasury, for the yeai next
ensuing There does not, indeed, appear to exist
any adequate reason for a special appropriation of
any large amount to this object, since the surplus of
two millions, allowed by the long-settled policy of
former years to f emain in the Treasury at the end of
each, would yield ample means of extending, when
expedient, the coinage of gold and silver bullion
But the Secretary requires, it has been seen, be-
sides the million for the Mint, " at least three or fom
millions more" toanswei sudden and contingent
calls, He has underrated, as I trust I have already
shown, by more than a million and a quarter, the
funds now placed at his disposal, and totally exclud
ed from his estimate near six millions more, that
might be derived from the bonds of the Bank of the
United States, to meet the current expenses of the
year And what does he now require at our hands i
That we shall grant him a clear surplus of at least
three or four millions more, over and above the
amount of his own estimate of all those expenses
The Secretary would, it seems, avail himself of
one of the provisions of the much-abused deposite
act, which reserved five millions of the surplus that
might be found m the Treasury on the first of Jan
uary, 1837, to ground a permanent charge upon the
country, at war with all the antecedent recommen-
dations of the Treasury Deparlment, and the long
settled usage of the Government (c ) Permit me
to call your attention to the origin and extent of the
surplus which every Secretary of the Treasury till
the present, and Mr Woodbury himself, until his
late report, has deemed sufficient to maintain the
public credit
Shortly after our last war with Gieat Britain,
when the Treasury was oppressed by a heavy pub-
lic debt, Mr Crawford, then Secretary f that De-
partment, recommended, for its speedy extinction,
an enlargement of the sinking fund from eight to
ten millions, and the further addition to it of all
sums beyond two millions of dollars, that might at
any time exist in the Treasury, beyond the money
required for the service of the year
This two million surplus he pioposed to reserve
for contingencies, leaving the current expenses of
eich year to be met by the current receipts of tl 
Treasury
To the salutary provisions incorporated by Con-
gress in the act of March, 1817, we owe the final
extinguishment of a national debt exceeding one
hundred and twenty millions Since the discharge
of that debt and the increased ability of the Gov-
ernment to obtain loans on short notice, the wisdom
of continuing to keep inactive so large a surplus ss
two millions, m order to piovide for contingencies
which may neverhappen,mightwell be questioned
But a peimanent extension of this surplus to four
millions, at the expense of a new debt, to be con-
tracted by the issue of ten millions of Treasury
notes, whethei with or without interest, is a position,
so preposteíou* and extraordinary, as to be íeserv
ed for the present Secretary, unless indeed, the de
posite act, an act temporary in its natuie, and the
result in all its fea'ures of compromise, may bo
deemed to supply a highei aiuhontv
I appeal to the venerable number from Massa-
chusetts, who composed patt of the same cabinet
with Mr Crawford, if I have noteoirecdy stated
the origin and ex ent of the policy of preserving a
fixed surplus m the Treasury
One attempt to i educe it below twu millions, I
well remember to have failed It was when, ra
conjunction with a distinguished chairman of the
Military Committee of this house, from South Cai-
ohna, (Col Drayton,) I sought to apply a part of
the two millions to the armament of the fortifica-
tions on our seaboard My argument was, that as
our fortifications were then defenceless, and as \v xi
was the most alarming of those contingencies, for
which a surplus revenue was reserved, a part of it

could not, in peace, be better applied, than m arm-
ing those forts, on the strength of which, the secu-
rny oí our fleets and seacoast might depend The
metal of the cannon upon their ramparts would be
as imperishable, at least, as the coin m the Treasu-
ry, and if both were suddenly required by the exi-
gencies of war, money coul 1 be more speedily pro-
vided, than ai ms
But although abortive attempts have been made
to reduce this surplus and it has, at the expiration
of the yeai, often fallen below two millions, no
member of this body has, I will venture to say, evei
heard its augmentation recommended, as a perma-
nent policy, nil the commencement of this extia
session, when, if at any time, a i eduction of all tin
necessary demands upon the cunency of the conn
try might have been expected, irom those espe-
cially, who have so greatly contributed to its de
rangement    Shall we, Mr Chairman, depart fiom
the usage of twenty years, by placing at the disci e-
tion of the Executive or his agents "a surplus of at
least three or four millions, to use the woids oí the
Secretary, and that, too, as he intimates, by a "re
sort to the deposites with the States, and to the instal-
ments destined foi themva October oi some other ie-
souice," subsequently explained to be the issue of
Treasury notes i
It cannot, Mr Chairman, (said Mi M ,) have
been unknown to the present Secretary of the
Treasury, that his immediate predecessor estimated
the balance w hich would remain at the expiration
of 1834 at less than three millions, of which, near
a million and a half then consisted of unavailable
funds, the notes, and long outstanding balances due
from the insolvent banks, which fell amidst the
crash of our currency during the last war Mi
Woodbury's own report oí December, 1834, shows
that the actual balance in the Treasmy on the 1st
of January 1831, including those unav ailable funds
scarcely exceeded tw o millions vet in. his annual
report ot Decembei, 1834 so fai from complaining
of any embarrassment of the Tieasury, from the
extinction of this surplus, he expressly enforces the
policy of the act of Maich 1817, which prescribed
the limitation of two millions The same Secre-
tary now requires twice that sum to meet the con-
tingencies of but ninety days, and this, loo, along
with a special appropriation of more than a mil-
lion and a half for the Flonda war
Nor should it escape observation, that m the very
next paragraph of the lepor. which I have quoted,
this oiheer urges in favor of the limitation con-
tained in the act of 1817, that "itwould leave the
bank agents of the Treasury, as its other fiscal
agents from the foundation of the Government hive
been left, wholly disconnected ts far as practicable,
with the dangerous relation of borrowers from, the
Treasury, for rcloanmg, and foi pnt ate gain "
Why the Secretary has discarded the commen-
dable jealousy which he manifested less than two
years ago, of themisapphca'ion of the public money
m the hands of the disbursing officers, who at this
moment hold, with his permission, more thin four
millions andaquiiter, exclusive of three founhs
of a million in the Mint, he has afforded us no e
planation whatever (d )
I come next, Mr Chairman, to consider that
item of his late estimates, for which he has le
ceived the eulogy of his frierds It is the deduc
«on of fifteen millions from the estimates for the
residue of the present year, on account ot the ba
lance of former appropriations which w ill ¡emain
unexpended on the 1st of Tanuaiy next and foi
which, therefoie, he asks of us no immediate pro-
v lsion
This deduction is, Ipeieene, imputed to an ac-
tual suspension of the extrav agant app npmtnns
of the last Congress, througn i spmt of economy
A word or two Mr Chairnvn as to the ongm of
those appropriations, of which tne Secretiiv com-
plains in his late lefer, as exceelms; h s estimites,
and his fuends as a cau^e of the pi ess I embar-
rassment of the Treasury
An bonciable membei from South Caiolina,
(Ml Pickens,) to my greaf isto iishment, cl \>-ges
the national republican paity w llh benis; rcsponst
ble foi those appropriations, one of which he c-ne
cially denounces, as an "effoit to loci   manne
hospitals on the rivers pnd cieeks of the west,
where it would be difficult to fill them mless by
collecting the bears and wolves (f the fo est"
Would it be believed that the only sites prescribed
for the erection of those hospitils are the southern
shore of Lake Erie and the banks of the Missis-
sippi and Ohio, and that their object is the preserva-
tion of the lives of the many thousand boatmen en-
gaged in the most extensive inland commerce on
the globe, a large proportion of whom are occa-
sionally exposed to a climate of all others most
fatal to healih"?
Por the rest of those appropriations, those "who
seek their origin must look to the reports of the
Committee of Commerce, which had, for its chair-
man, agendeiaan irom Pennsylvania, of whom, in
his absence I will say no more than that he was,
and had been, a most zealous friend of the late ad-
ministratis The light-house and harbor bills
both emanated from this committee, whose en-
croachments on the province oi the Committee on
Roads and Canals were sustained by the dominant
party of the day, to the utter disregard of one of the
positive provisions of a standing rule of the house;
and the wholesome condition repeatedly, though
vainly, urged by the chairman and other members
of that committee, that no appropriation of public
money should be made to any object of internal im-
provement until its national character had been
established on the basis of its general utility, and
its probable cost ascertained by a caieful examina-
tion, sune,r and estimate Toa depaiture from
these salutaiy restnctions, may be imputed, the
number oi those appropriations which the War
Department reports its utter inability to expend, be-
cause then objects are unknown or unattainable.
A full share, let me add, of the responsibility for
all those appropriations rests, immediately, with
the jresent Secretary of the Treasury and the Ex-
ecutive, which sanctioned his annual repoits of
the last and the preceding years, as their inspec-
tion will undeniably prov e For, while the labor
of this officer has been directed, daring the present
session of Congress, to an augmentation of the sur-
plus m the Tieasury, far beyond the bounds of any
iormer necessity, under color of piovidmg for con-
tingencies, it appears to have Been his constant
stiidj, since, as well as prior to the deposite act of
1836, to leduee that surplus by lavish expenditures.
Hence, in his report of December, 1835, where he
prescribes the most "judicious course to pursue" in
using the surplus, which he estimated at " between
six and seven millions only," be tells us m so many
words, that "in order to reduce it, there might be
judiciously authorized, for purposes not enumerated
in any of tlte estimates, other beneficial expenditures,
foi objects clearly lawful and useful "
As late, indeed, as his last annual report, in
ti eating of the pioper disposition of the surplus in
the Treasury, wh ch he distinctly intimates, would
be likely to continue he reminds us that "various
objects, of a national and constitutional character,
were lecommended m his prior report, as suitable
for the application, by u-ay of extraordinary appro-
priation, of any surplus funds for which the Gene-
ral Government should happen to have no other
immediate use " "Liberal and useful appropna
tions," he sa} s, " were fortunately made to many of
th m, which will save expe iso in the end, and
piove to be the soundest economy " " The rea-
sons," h subjoins, " for a continuance of the same
vi%e policy, while oui resources i emain %o ample,
have lost none of their original force ' Such was
his language in December last That, no miscon-
ception may exist as to the < haracter of the objects
which he rcgauled as "la* ful and u«eful," the suc-
ceeding paragraph to that which I have quoted ex-
piessly comprehends among the proper objects for
Hit ijiplication of such surplus, the following
' Completing with it, sooner than had been contem-
plated, the proiected fortifications and naval estab-
lishment, of the country improving more rapidly
*be navigation and security of its commercial bays
and nveis, and while its imports and exports wic
pwspeious beyond all example, erecting, where
reeded, appropriate custom and ware houses, as well
is suitable'marine hospitals count-houses, and post-
ojj ccs ' Immediately following this enumeration,
will be found an earnest íecommendation of the
rept al of certain duties on imports, to the extent of
' I'ne- "iillions and a half"—a measure which un-
doub'edly indicated no want of confidence m the
ic venue of the present year
It may, theiefore, be confidently affirmed, m op-
p Mtion *o all that we have heard in the course of
this debate, and to those complaints of the Secretary
1 imself m the first of his late letters, that he not
only entertained no apprehension that the revenue
of the cm rent year would fall be'cw his estimate of
twenty four millions, but that h- desired a contin-
uation of those very appropriations, by which the
expenditures of the year have been made to exeeed
