HEADQUARTERS TWENTY-FIRST ARMY CORPS,Chattanooga Valley, September 14, 1863-4 p.m.

Major General G. GRANGER,

Rossville:

SIR: The general commanding directs me to acknowledge receipt of your dispatch of this 12.30 p.m. His troops are here on Missionary Ridge, and have been since 10 a.m., awaiting orders. There is no enemy here, at least not in front or vicinity, and all that the general has ever seen was cavalry on his left and front yesterday and the day before. Not a shot has been heard to-day. Colonel Wilder and his brigade has passed up this valley to-day, and I have heard directly from a scout (through from General Thomas to-day, who is encamped 10 miles up this valley) that the road is clear. The general does not known, and did not before believe, that the enemy was in force in this valley. The general commanding the department has had information, he supposes, that induced him to concentrate his wing here, but thus far nothing has been seen or heard of. General Wood, stationed at Gordon's Mills, will probably communicate with you if he gains any information from his left.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

P. P. OLDERSHAW,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS TWENTY-FIRST ARMY CORPS,Chickamauga Creek,near Gower's, September 16, 1863-9.45 p.m.

SIR: The general commanding directs you to see that your men have three days' rations in haversacks and 20 rounds of ammunition in the pocket of each man in addition to having his cartridge-box full. There are some indications that the enemy is massing for an attack on our left.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

P. P. OLDERSHAW,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.

(To each division commander.)
HEADQUARTERS TWENTY-FIRST ARMY CORPS,Chickamauga Creek, near Gower's, September 16, 1863-8 a.m.

Colonel R. H. G. MINTY,

Commanding Cavalry Brigade:

SIR: The general commanding directs me to acknowledge receipt of your note of yesterday reporting (by citizens) Forrest at Ringgold, Pegram at Leet's. Buckner at Rock Spring Church, and Longstreet at Dalton.* This would argue infantry, which the general commanding does not believe in, and he desires you to ascertain so far as practicable the truth of these reports.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

P. P. OLDERSHAW,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.
