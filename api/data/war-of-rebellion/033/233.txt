3,000 men against what is coming. General Curtis desires me to give you the above information. I believe they will try to get as near Saint Louis as they can.

SAINT LOUIS, MO., April 21, 1863-11.50 p. m.

Colonel TYLER:

Send hired express (Deer, or any trusty man) to Centreville, to communicate your last dispatch about Price to General Vandever, who is marching toward the Knob. Send hired express of trusty men to Fredericktown rapidly to ascertain whereabouts of General McNeil, and to hurry him up, by my order. Call out Lindsay's and Whitely's regimens of Enrolled Militia immediately; put them in camp as fast as you can, or in proper buildings at Arcadia. Put the court-house and main buildings in a state of defense at Arcadia; do the same, if required, at the Knob. The two 24-pounder howitzers must be planted at the depot in proper position. I will be down in the morning with an extra engineer officer. Drill your troops; drill three times a day.

Have you ammunition enough for small-arms? You ought to have 150 rounds per man. Office open all night. Acknowledge receipt.

J. W. DAVIDSON,

Brigadier-General.

SAINT LOUIS DISTRICT, April 21, 1863.

General HERRON, Rolla:

The enemy drove Smart's regiment out of Patterson, one of my out-posts, yesterday about 4 p. m. Hard fighting; our loss in killed, wounded, and missing said to be 200. The enemy's force variously estimated from 2,500 to 4,000, with artillery. Marmaduke said to be in command. The worst of it is, Smart has lost Marmaduke's whereabouts. I send Glover, with 1,500 cavalry and four pieces, after him. If your cavalry could co-operate, we may get him or his artillery. I think he will go out by the way of Barnesville, as he knows I have a small post there.

J. W. DAVIDSON,

Brigadier-General.

SAINT LOUIS, MO., April 21, 1863-1.30 p. m.

Colonel TYLER, Commanding:

No flag of truce can go to the enemy until this fighting is over. You must defend Fort Curtis; it covers the entrance to the Bellevue Valley.

J. W. DAVIDSON,

Brigadier-General.

Brigadier-General DAVIDSON, Saint Louis:

I have sent General Vandever, with 2,500 cavalry and six pieces of artillery, in the direction of Pilot Knob. Should he hear of the enemy
