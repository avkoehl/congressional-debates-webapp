Party PdHHts^—Mr. Pope.
Kó. of Refé
the present Congress Permit me to say to gen-
tlemen of the Whig party, that they will confuse
the public mind by making- too many points in
their cause, some of them irrelevant and unten-
able, and others of a doubtful character and not
to be depended on in a great contest of principle
When I first catare to the bar, I was in the habit
of urging to the jury many points when two or
three would have been Sufficient. Í ever found
that course unfortunate, my adversary met and
defeated mé on my weakest ground, and the at-
tention of the jury was too often diverted from
the true question at issue Experience soon dem-
onstrated to me that, if my cause was good, the
most honest and best policy was to select my
strong points and press them,unobseured by im-
material matters, on the attention of the jury. I
must be permitted to Say to gentlemen of the Op-
position, if their cause is good, honesty and fair-
ness is the best policy 1 would advise that good
and substantial pleas in bar to the continuance of
the present men in power should be put in, and
verified by proof and argument
I will now endeavor to place before tms House
and the people the principles contended for by the
President and his friends. By the third section
of the second article of the Constitution, it is pro-
vided that the President shall, from time to time,
give to the Congress information of the state of
the Union, and recommend to then consideration
such measures as he shall judge necessary and
expedient This is the only grant of power to
the Piesidcnt to influence, direct, or control the
legislative action of Congiess in advance After
Congress has acted, and presented a bill to the
President for his approval, he is authonzed to
consider it, and may return it with his objections,
which can only be overruled by a majority of
two thuds With regard to measures which Con-
gress may judge necessary and expedient for the
good of the people, the President is not author
ized to prejudge 01 veto in advance, and has no
authority to interfere until Congiess shall have
acted To denounce a measure befoiehand, to
prevent the action of Congress, is either an as-
sumption of authority or an exeicise of influence
incompatible with the spirit of this free system
of government. The President, in his fiist mes-
sage to this Congress, not content with discharg-
ing the duty imposed on him by the Constitution,
in recommending measures for the consideration
of Congress, in umates an uncompromising hos
tility to a national bank, and indirectly menaces
us with a veto íf the advocates of a strict con-
struction of the Constitution, who protest against
implied andconstiuctive powers, can indorse this
unauthorized assumption of the Executive, I must
declaie my dissent from it
The Piesident next called on Congiess for a
bankrupt law, to annul the State banks which
had abused then powers—banks owing then eie-
ation to State power, and responsible only to the
States This appears to me the highest prolog
ative ever claimed for this Government ovei tin1
sovereignty of the States, and aims a more fanl
stab at their authomy and independence than has
been ever suggested since the ongin of this Fed-
eral Govemment The alien and sedition laws
were trifles compared with this most extravagant
pretension Whether banks denying then chat-
ters from State authority have abused or foi ftited
their charters aie questions of State cognizance
exclusively, and beyond the pale of Pedeial au-
thouty The proposition advanced by the Pres
ldent is so obviously and palpably monstrous,
that no argument can be necessary to expose its
fallacy, no reasoning has ever been advanced in
either House to sustain it If the State rights
gentlemen can countenance for a moment this as-
sault upon the sovereignty of the States, they
will excuse me for declining to be of their party
In the second messige of the President to this
Congress in December, 1837, he imputes the re-
sult of the elections in New York to bank influ-
ence, and at least indirectly impeaches the mo
tives of the people when acting in thur highest
sovereign capacity Are the motives and conduct
of the people, in the exeicise of the right of self-
goveinment, to be questioned before any human
tnbunal' If the people aie not soveieign in the
selection of agents to manage their affairs, how,
or wheK,or when is the principle of self govern-
ment seen, fell, orVnderstood? and where, unless
at the polls, is the sovereignty of the people dis-
played ' If they are sovereign, who dare to ar-
raign their pufity and infallibility? The sover-
eign is ever to fee presumed right, just, and wise;
and if wrong, that sovereign alone must correct
its own eriors Prom what part of the Consti-
tution does the President deduce the high prerog-
ative of instituting an inquisition into the motives
and conduct of the people, the common sovereign
over all public agents and functionaries known to
this Government' The pdlls, the ballot-boxes,
are the channels througn which the public will is
most clearly and constitutionally expressed; and
the inquiry can never be made, what influenced
the voters? but can only go to the fact, has the
popular will been expressed, and how has the
sovereign spoken >
ThePresldent, in his last message to Congress,
has traveled out of the sphere of Executive ac-
tion, and assailed the decision of the inferior court
and Supreme Court of the United States in the
mandamus case against the Postmaster General
Now, Mr Chairman, where does the President
deduce the constitutional authority to ariaign the
decisions of the judicial tribunals at the bar of this
House? The executive,judicial, and legislative
departments are declared to be separate and dis-
tinct, and their respective powers are defined by
the Constitution It certainly does not belong to
the Executive to revise and condemn the decís
ions of the Judiciary; but to Congress, and mote
to this House, has the Constitution assigned the
power to inquire into the conduct of the judges,
and to impeach them, if necessary and pioper to
do so If the Piesident had suggested the pro-
pi icty of repealing the power to issue the writ of
mandamus in the cases referred to, I certainly
should not find fault with him, because., Mr Clian-
man, I solemnly protest against the puwei of the
Judiciary or the Executive to oidei money out of
the Tieasury of the people without the authonty
of the Reptesentatives of the people Congiess,
and more especially this House, has, by the Con-
stitution, control of the public puise. Mi P
said he had not read or consideied the opinion of
the court in the mandamus case,noi was he pre
pared to pionounce it light or wiong.but he was
inclined to concur with the Piesident, that the
powei, if it existed, to order money out of the
Tieasury by mandamus, ought to be repealed
Thefhst and vita! principle of free govemment
held by enlightened Whigs in England and
Ampiiea, and for which so much blood has been
shed by our ancestors, consists in preseiving to
the repiesentative body the exelusive guardian-
ship and control of the public puise
This is the cardinal point involved in the
mighty political struggle now pending before the
nation Shall the Treasuiy of the people be di-
voiced fiom the control of the President, and
restored to the care of their immediate Repiesent-
atives5 is the gicat question to be decided in the
piesent political contest This is the gieat con
seivative principle which has been maintained
foi agesby the enlightened fnends of fieedom in
England and this countiy, as the best and only
effectual security for the liberties of the people
against tyianny and oppression It is the old
question betwi en the lnends of hbeity and the
powei and privileges of Pailiament and the sup-
poiteis of the power and preiogatives of the
Ciown. In that contest, after a long and bloody
struggle, the Whigs of England tiiumphed over
the advocates of Executive powei, as they will
here if they will only make this the prominent
plea m bar to the continuance of this Adminis-
tration. I beseech gentlemen not to obscure this
leading point by vague and indefinite talks about
large expenditures, for which a large portion of
the Opposition voted, or Executive patronage,
which they have aided to increase. Mr P said
that, by the removal of the deposits from the
care of those to whom it had been confided by
Congiess, the custody and control of the pub
he funds had been wiested fiom the represetita-
! tive body, and this sub-Treasuiy scheme, uiged
upqn Congress and the nation by the President
I and his friends, was intended to consummate the
| usurpations of ins illustrious piedecessor The
I President and his supporters contend that the
I key of the strong box should be placed in the
hands of the President and those under his im-
mediate direction, while his opponents insist that
the public money should be oónfided to agents
under the oontiol óf, and directly responsible to,
Congress It is, I repeat, in essence, the old
question between the power of Parliamentiind
royat prerogative. And I would exhort the Op-
position to let nothmj; divert the public attention
from this leading and great qudstitfrf 1 sftall be
one of the last to speak in terms'©fdisie&peet e>r
reproach of General Jackson, a brave mail and a
patriot, who so often staked his life for his coun-
try, and shed luster on our national character
Few men have felt more giateful than myself for
his public services or more admiration for his
brilliant achievements. I was zealous and sin-
cere in my efforts to bestow on him the highest
honor in the gift of his country
While I respect this illustrious individual, and
am ready to honor him for his deeds of valor, I
can never indorse his assaults upon the funda-
mental principles of the Constitution, and his dis-
regard of the powers, will, and action, of the
legislative body With his motives I have no
concern, nor do I intend to question their purity,
but I owe it to myself, to my country, and to mv
immediate constituents, to raise my vpice, on all
proper occasions, against that aibitrary, ruinous
measure, the removal of the deposits." By that
act, the wall of paitition placed by the Constitu-
tion betWeen the legislative and executive depart-
ments was broken down, and the equilibrium of
powerestablished by that instrument overthrown.
It was done in defiance of the expiessed will of
the legislative body, and it was an unauthorized
mterfeience with the official powei s and duties of
the Secictaiy of the Treasuiy, for which I could
never find any justification dr apology The
public motley was placed m the United States
Bink by the Legislatuie, never to be removed by
the Secietary withoutieasons, and those leasons
to be assigned to Congress, instead of the Piesi-
dept I insist that the officer at the head of the
Tieasuty, accoidtng to the ttue intent and spirit
of the Constitution and laws, is the officer of
Congiess quoad the custody and management of
the public money, and that the Piesident could
not rightfully dnect oi conttol the action of that
department The power of lemoval for gross
misconduct does not cany with it the light to
dnect the fiseal operations of the Tieasury De-
partment No Piesident had ever assumed such
dnection or control, not even Washington or Jef-
ferson, whose popularity enabled them to enlargo
Executive powei and influence mote than any
Presidents, until the reign of General Jackson.
By a refeience to the first laws creating the sev-
eral Depaitments of this Government, a maiked
difference will be noticed between the Depait-
ments of State, War, and the Navy, and the law
creating the Treasury Department, that of State,
Wai, and Navy, are called Executive Depart-
ments, and placed under the control and dnection
of the President, whet cas the Treasury Depart-
ment is not called an Executive Department, and
the head of the Tieasury is to perform such du-
ties as shall be directed by law This distinction
runs through most of the State constitutions, and
the money department is considered everywhere
dnectly under the control and dnection of the
legislative body The submission of this people
and then íepiesentatives to this lawless mtei-
ference of the Executive with the public money,
in defiance of legislative will, has surprised and
moitified me more than anything which has oc-
cuned in our political history
The reign of General Jackson, m many of its
features, may be compared with that of Queen
Elizabeth, called by the English commentator?
the greatest of English monarchs She mar
tamed the most absolute authority, without losir
the affections of the people By hei energy an 
skill she defeated the most formidable fleet that
had ever sailed on the ocean, called the Spanish
Armada, and laid the foundation of the naval
power of England, and gave to England a rank in
the scale of nations unknown before Her course
was, in many respects, tyiannical, but her de-
portment was popular She professed love for
the people and acknowledged their liberties, but
took care to use her own dictionary to define the
term liberty.   Her will was, in a great degree,
