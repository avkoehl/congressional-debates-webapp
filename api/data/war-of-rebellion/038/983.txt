We are actually on sufferance, and the consequence, is, as far as I can hear, there is complaining and general dissatisfaction throughout our lines.

We are, and have been, kept close in the trenches day and night, not allowed to forage any at all, and even if permitted, there is nothing to be had among the citizens.

Men don't want to starve, and don't intend to, but they call upon you for justice, if the commissary department can give it; if it can't, you must adopt some means to relieve us very soon. The emergency of the case demands prompt and decided on your part.

If you can't feed us, you had better surrender us, horrible as the

idea is, than suffer this noble army to disgrace themselves by desertion. I tell you plainly, men are not going to lie here perish, if they do love their country dearly. Self-preservation is the law of nature, and hunger will compel a man to do almost anything.

You had better heed a warning voice, though it is the voice of a private soldier.

This army is now ripe for mutiny, unless it can be fed.

Just think of one small biscuit and one or two mouthfuls of bacon per day. General, please direct your inquiries in the proper channel, and see if I have not stated stubborn facts, which had better be heeded before we are disgraced.
