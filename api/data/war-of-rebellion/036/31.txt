furnish supplies to the troops. Once there, I do not feel a doubt of success in the entire cleaning out of the enemy from the banks of the river.

At least three of my army corps commanders take hold of the new policy of arming the negroes and using them against the enemy with a will. They, at lest, are so much of soldiers as to feel themselves under obligation to carry out a policy which they would not inaugurate in the same good faith and with the same zeal as if it was of their own choosing. You may rely on me carrying out any policy ordered by proper authority to the best of my ability. *

MILLIKEN'S BEND, La., April 21, 1863,

VIA MEMPHIS, TENN., April 24.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

I move my headquarters to New Carthage to-morrow. Every effort will be exerted to get speedy possession of Grand Gulf, and from that point to open the Mississippi. If I do not underestimate the enemy, my force is abundant, with a foothold once obtained, to do the work. Six transports will run the Vicksburg batteries to-night.

YOUNG'S POINT, La., April 23, 1863,

VIA MEMPHIS, TENN., April 25-1 p. m.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

Six boats and a number of barges ran the Vicksburg batteries last night. All the boats got by more or less damaged. The Tigress sunk at 3 a. m., and is a total loss. Crew all safe. The Moderator was much damaged. I think all the barges went through safely. Colonel C. B. Lagow, of my staff, was on the Tigress, in command of the fleet. Casualties, so far as reported, 2 men mortally wounded, and several (number not known) wounded, more or less severely. About five hundred shots were fired. I look upon this as a great success. At the Warrenton batteries there was heavy firing, but all the boats were seen to go past. What damage done there is not known.

Major-General.

NEAR GRAND GULF, MISS., April 27, 1863,

VIA MEMPHIS, TENN., May 2-9 p. m.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

Moving troops from Smith's plantation has been a tedious operation; more so than it should have been. I am now embarking troops for the attack on Grand Gulf. Expect to reduce it to-morrow.

U. S. GRANT.
