rolls of regiments, companies, and detachments, as filed by the duly-appointed U. S.mustering officers for the State. Where, as in some few instances, no muster-in rolls of regiments were filed the numbers were taken from the first muster and pay rolls of the organization. It will be seen by a letter to the Governor, of date June 2, copy here-with, that the Department contemplated a comparison of the State records of men furnished with those of this office. In answer to that letter the adjutant-general of the State, under date of July 9, has furnished a statement, from which the numbers herein referred to as claimed by the State have been taken. As the present records of the Department will not allow a credit to be given for the disputed number (9,517) of recruits, it remains for the State to show by the muster-in rolls thereof that the she is entitled to said credit. As the statement from the adjutant-general of the State does not exhibit in detail the data upon which the claim for the disputed recruits rests, it will devolve on a special comparison of the State with the U. S.records to show that the State is justly entitled to the credit therefor Should it by that appear that the State is entitled to the credit, then she will have an excess of 14,212 (three-years", two-years", and nine-months" men) above all calls. By Exhibit A of July [June] 11, from this office, she had an excess of 4,695 three-years" men. It is proper to add that the adjutant-general of New York, in the recapitulation of troops furnished in 1861, remarks: "Recruits for regiments in the field estimated at 11,000." In the report of the adjutant-general for 1863 it is stated that the recruits sent to old regiments since the date of last report (January 15, 1862) "will not fall below 20,000."
