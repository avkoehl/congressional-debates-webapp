Number 18. Reports of Major General William W. Loring, C. S. Army. ENTERPRISE, April 25, 1863.

Enemy appeared here at 1 o'clock and demanded the town. They were represented as 1,500 strong. Colonel [Edward] Goodwin was here with the Thirty-FIFTH Alabama, who defied them. I hastened here with two regiments; enemy have fallen back at last accounts 3 miles. I am now on the road pursuing them. They are on the road to Paulding; think they will endeavor to go back by Newton or make their way to Baton Rouge. Have sent back to burn the bridge across Swimming Stream, between Paulding and Newton. Have sent two companies to guard bridge at Quitman, and directed bridges to be burned between Quitman and Paulding. I telegraphed to send force from Mobile to guard the De Soto and Quitman bridges. If they get there in time, and you can send force to intercept them at Newton, it will force them to go in the direction of Baton Rouge. Please order cavalry to intercept them in that direction. I have no hope of catching them on foot.

General PEMBERTON.

ENTERPRISE, April 25, 1863.

I could not as expected intercept the enemy here. They were, when last heard from, at Garlandville, about 1,500. They will attempt to cross the road at Newton, or some point between Meridian and Jackson. I will endeavor to prevent their doing so this side of Newton.

Colonel [Edward] Goodwin reports enemy again within 3 miles of Enterprise. He thinks from their returning that they are in force.
