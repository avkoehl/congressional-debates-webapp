General THOMAS:

I am quite unwell to-day. General Schofield is marching for and will take up position on the right. I think well of General Stanley's keeping a mere line of display were General Schofield was for a few days, and if you can occupy General Palmer's place in the main line by withdrawing General force in reserve on the right. As soon as General Schofield selects his right flank we must assume the offensive against the railroad between White Hall and East Point. I have no doubt that General McCook damaged the Southern road and that provisions and ammunition will be short in the rebel camp. But we must look to our own depots. Please do all that is possible to organize a force od cavalry about Marietta, composed of General Kilpatrick's division and such of General McCook's as have returned. Also have the old rebel lines west of Chattahoochee lightly guarded to cover to cover our brigade. Order all brigades above Pace's, except that at Roswell, to be destroyed.

Major-General SHERMAN;

Your received. Orders have been given to Kilpatrick to move down to Marietta and guard the road from the river to that place. A regiment has been sent to occupy the old rebel works across the river toward Vining's and at Turner's Ferry. The First Wisconsin Cavalry has been ordered down the river to pick up the scattered men of McCook's command. The remaining four guns of the battery McCook had with him have been put in the works near the railroad brigade, and Major Purdy with the 280 men with which he returned, and all others he can collect, ordered to the same place.

GEO. H. THOMAS.

General THOMAS:

General Schofield is in position on General Howard's right and extends one mile and a half in a south course, his right being on ahead one-half southeast of lot 213. He faces a branch of Utoy Creek, and General Howard thinks the East Point and Atlanta road lines on the ridge opposite, which the enemy holds in force. General Schofield represents Utoy Creek opposite his right as about the size of Olley's Creek, and thinks its passage will be seriously resisted. Better get General Palmer's corps ready and we must break through somewhere. The rest of our line should make dashes and secure lodgments close up under the main works.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
