H. OLADOWSKI,

Lieutenant-Colonel.
HEADQUARTERS, &amp;C.,Wiley's House, June 20, 1864.

Major-General FRENCH,

Commanding, &c.:

GENERAL: I got your note and sent at once to Captain Morris to send your company to you. I shall examine closely the necessity of loaning you the other two engineer companies. Like yourself, they too are urgent for more tools, and Featherson is more exposed than any other, and Walthall equally with you. As soon as the enemy establish their batteries I am looking for them to open at any moment on our right. Hurry up the defense along your line. I am going to the right, and come our way.

Respectfully,

W. W. LORING,

Major-General.
