whackers. I think they are the same that cut the wire this side of Pleasant Hill yesterday. The death of Brigadier General E. B. Brown was read in the Catholic church to-day. The driver said he only came from Holden and did not hear of it, and no passengers from Warrensburg to this place.

I remain, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

B. F. ALLEN.

Major Pickler, with 400 men (Confederates), was in Pineville, McDonald County, last Thursday night. He move from King's River, in Arkansas, to Pineville between Thursday morning and Thursday evening. He seems to be moving north. The troops from Cassville and Neosho may intercept him. The force moving into this district from the Central District would move through Clintonville and in the direction of Lamar. It would be likely to meet him.
