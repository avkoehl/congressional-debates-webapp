the First Maryland on the Hanover turnpike, in position to protect the right of my line. The very superior force of dismounted skirmishers of the enemy advanced on our left and front required the line to be re-enforced by one of General Custer's regiments. At this time the skirmishing became very brisk on both sides, and an artillery fire was begun by the enemy and ourselves. During the skirmish of the dismounted men, the enemy brought upon the field a column for a charge. The charge of this column was met by the Seventh Michigan Cavalry, of the First[Second]Brigade, Third Division, but not successfully. The advantage gained in this charge was soon wrested from the enemy by the gallant charge of the First Michigan, of the same brigade. This regiment drove the enemy back to his starting point. Other charges were made by the enemy's columns, but in every instance were they driven back. Defeated at every point, the enemy withdrew to his left, and on passing the wood in which the First New Jersey Cavalry was posted, that regiment gallantly, and successfully charged the flank of his column. Heavy skirmishing was still maintained by the Third Pennsylvania Cavalry with the enemy, and was continued until nightfall. During the engagement, a portion of this regiment made a very handsome and successful charge upon one of the enemy's regiments. The enemy retired his column behind his artillery, and at dark withdrew from his former position. At this time I was at liberty to relieve the First[Second] Brigade of the Third Division, which was directed to join its division. Our own and the enemy's loss during this engagement was severe. Our loss:Officers, 1 killed, 17 wounded, and 1 missing; enlisted men, 33 killed, 140 wounded, and 103 missing. *On the morning of the 4th, I advanced to the enemy; s position, but found him gone. Following toward Hunterstown, I found many of his wounded abandoned. From these we learned that the enemy had been severely punished and his loss heavy. One general officer was severely wounded. Brigadier-General Custer, commanding Firs[Second] Brigade, Third Division, very ably assisted me in the duties of my command. Colonel J. B. McIntosh, commanding First Brigade of my division, handled his brigade with great skill, and deserves particular mention for his gallantry and untiring energy throughout the day. The Third Brigade, Second Division, Colonel J. Irvin Gregg commanding, was held in reserve upon the field. The batteries commanded by Captain A. M. Randolf and Lieutenant A. C. Pennington, jr., rendered most effective service. The fire of the artillery during this engagement was the most accurate that I have ever seen. It gives me great pleasure to bring to the notice of the major-general commanding the efficiency and gallantry exhibited by my entire staff on this occasion. A list of casualties of this engagement has heretofore been forwarded, and will again be found in a consolidated list.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

D. McM. GREGG,

Brigadier General of Volunteers, Comdg. Second Division.

Lieutenant Colonel A. J. ALEXANDER, A. A. G., Cavalry Corps.
