ihe President If otherwise, the conclusion of
the bill is most lame and impotent It ptoposes
to make the very man who procures the act to be
done pumsh those who perpetrate itj as if, sup-
posing the President to be so los t to a sense of pro-
pnety and official integrity as actually to employ
ins officers in the management of elections, hfe
would hesitate to retain them in their places after
it was done, in devanee of your law. The con-
traiy expectation would be about as reasonable
as that of the valiant knight of La Manclia, that
his faithful Sancho would flagellate himself un-
mercifully with many stripes, that the fair Dul-
cinea might be disenchanted
But the Sertator cites us another -precedent,
drawn from the Constitution itself, which de-
clares that no public officer shall have a seat in
either House of Congress But this does not
meet the difficulties of the present case at all
There is no parity between a constitutional pro-
vision and a legislative enactment
Another precedent is quoted from the laws of
Virginia, which prohibit an officer undei the
United States from holding office under the State
ofViigima, and the Senator might have cited
similar precedents from other States, but this has
nothing to do with the question No one denies
st, and the report assumes that the States have a
right to legislate on this subject if they think
propei
< Cut [says the report} if any mischief his irisen or may
arise fmm this pairee, the le<ntiin ite remedy must be nought
and loujid in the legislation of the seveial Slates whose
-constitutional dutj it is to prescribe the pnvileges and im
«mm tics ol then cituens, free from the control of Federal
legislation '
But, sir, the subject is an exceedingly delicate
one I deny that any evil exists But li it does,
st had better be boine than to attempt Us íemedy
by the means proposed If I weie conscious of
iiome disease  in  the eye, however tlneatening
night be its character, sooner than suffer it to be
dealt with by an unskillful hand, I would take the
< nance of any result    This bill is one of the
nostdangeious assaults upoji the integrity of our
institutions* I have ever known, and is well calcu-
lated, if it passes, totally to change them It is
highly mischievous in that by assumption, its
tendency is erroneously to impiess the public
mind as to facts and principles Now, I do not
impute to the Senator fiom Kentucky, who framed
ihe bill, any design to overthrow the institutions
of his country But I speak of the tendencies of
•he bill, and believe the state of mind under which
tt has been brought forward, is happily desuibed
in a shoit newspaper paragraph, which Í will

INTBRF6K1SWCE IN ELECTIONS
SPEECH OF HON. JOHN NORVELL,
OF MICHIGAN
In the Senate, February 16, Í839,
Oa the bill of Mr Crittenden to prevent the interference
of certain Tederal OtScersm Elections
Mr NORVELL said-
Mr President Before I proceed to present my
views of the bill now under consideration, I de-
slíe to perform an act of justice to my Whig
fnends on the other side of the Senate, and to a
distinguished statesman of the Republican party,
once a member of this body It was the misfor-
tune of thateminent statesman, in vindicating- the
removals and appointments made by President
Jackson, to utter the sentiment that " to the victor
belong the spoils " Por that doctrine he has re-
ceived the unqualified denunciations of the Oppo-
sition, and his party friands have shared an equal
degree of condemnation for confirming, by their
policy, the principle which he avowed My pur-
pose now is to show that Governor Maicy is not
entitled to the credit of first pioclaiming this as
the rule of political warfare, that its origin is to
be traced to a Whig source, and its example and
Fraclice to the Federal party of Massachusetts
n the second volume of the Life of Elbndge
Gerry, written by James T Austin, now the
able Whig attorney general of that State, and the
biographer of Mr Gerry, I find these passages
" Mr Geiry entered upon the office of Governor of Mas
saclmsetts twenty nine \cars ago At that time, says his
biographer,' with tin dnectors of política! parties the long
retín incut of Ml < < riy h id given him no opportunity to
bi come intini ite I he cli luges winch time had made in

uient had Kft linn Um 1st without peisonal acqu nntance
with them and the d< sire which his party had t) place his
name as a candidate attbeir liead,had itself, if theie had been
no other leasou, rendered Ins advance to the Chief Ma„is
tiaey wholly independent of all conditions, stipul mons,
and expectancies In In own political sentiments, matured
as they were by time and experience, he was immovably
confirmed, but m regaid to individuals or parlies, other
than as they came recommended by character andconduct,
he was impartial, unfettered, and independent Bat, after
all what is the north, of a victory if the enemy are allowed
to possess the spoils ? Of what consequence is it who are
masters ot the field, so long as the vanquished retain their
po sessions ? The battle between the gieat political parties
had been fought at th" ballot boxes again and again, and
constant defeat had embittered and exasperuod the disap
pointed competitors lhey beheld, for a long series of
years, the lionois and emoluments of ornee, the pride of
pi ice and the dignity ol stuton, held by then political ad
versaues until the lepioaeh of being a D< mocrat was con
sidered as impassable a barnei to public station as the want
of moral character or intellcctu il ability ' l The judicial

upon Democracy as the chej d'ceuires of taste upon the alio

Pcdeialists to inspire the opinion and it was probably their
belief—for st if love is exceedingly credulous of praise—

The Senator fiom Massachusetts [Mr Web-
ster] inquirí s from what book T have read these
passages, and asks whether I do not know that
Governor Gerry belonged to my party, and was
turned out in one year* If the Senatoi had not
been inattentive, he would have heard it distinctly
announced that the book which I have just laid
down was the biography of Elbndge Gen y, writ-
ten by James T Austin, the present attorney gen-
eral of Massachusetts It is the production of a
modern Whig, sir, now in the enjoyment of " the
spoils" of Federal victory He it is, and not Gov-
ernor Marey, who first proclaimed " the spoils"
doctrine, and demanded what was the value of a
tnumph if the vanquished were suffered " to re-
tain then possessions?" He was describing the
piactice of the Fedeial party when in power, their
pioscription tiom office of eveiy Demociatic Re-
1 publican, and their strict adheience to the pnn-
SÓlíiSPfe
ciple, that" to the victorfcelong thespoiis ** Sir,
I do know that Governor Gerry was of my party.
He was not dismissed m one year He was m->
elected, he acted in a spirit of liberality and con-
ciliation towards his opponents during his first
term, he deviated from that course in fits second
In the history of parties in England, we have
memorable examples of the secession of leaders
from their early friends, and the formation of alli-
ances with ancient political adversaries A cor-
dial union for the common-object, the destruction
of the existing administration, has always natu-
rally followed On such occasions, the necessity
of breaking down ail party names, in order to
form a strong body in opposition, has generally-
been well understood, and urged with mostaal ardor
and vigor Ulterior views, and the division of
spoils between the new allies, have been post-
poned until the common enemy has been VarW
quished Paity spirit, the agitation of valiant
principles, as between the different members of
the coalition, have been deprecated; and meas-
ures which might bring them into common con-
cert have been devised, and supported with zeal,
until the compact has been consolidated, and
capable of moving on with perfect union and har-
mony.
A conjuncture of this sort is now before our
eyes We see secessions here, and in Some of
the States, fiom the great Republican party of the
country We see a coalition formed and forming-
in the midst of us, to subvert the present repub-
lican Administration We see party names eX>
tmguished, the agitation Of discordant principles
hushed into profound silence, the ulterior" views
of rival chieftamssuppressed from public Observa-
tion, and the division of the spoils deferred until
the power of paicelmg them out shall have been
completely attained And, sir, I am much mis-
taken if the bill before us be not a measure de-
vised to enable the dawning Whig and Conserv-
ative coalition to meet on common ground*, and
to prosecute the war against us without the dan-
ger of agitation and discord among the allied
leaders of Opposition
This Government, Mr President, has been m
operation fifty years     It has rarely transcended
its limited powers     When it has gone beyond
its constitutional boundaries, it has been brought
back to its republican tack    It has not interfered
with the right of suffiage, which belongs exclu-
sively to the States     The elective franchise, the
liberty of speech and of the press, have been left
to their regulation    The General Government,
except during the short reigh of terror in the
days of Federal phrensy, acting in the spirit ot
its chartered grant of power, has abstained from
invading any of the reserved rights of the States
Ihe  abuses committed  at  elections  by public
officeis, during the administration of the tlder
Adams, goaded Mr Jefferson into the utterance
of impressive animadversions upon their conduct
He admonished those of his appointment against
the imitation of the example which had been set
j them     He  warned  them of the consequences
which would result from the pursuit of such a
I couis^of inteifiience in the State elections   The
j distinguished leaders of the Republican opposi-
I «on to the administration of the younger Adams
I dnected public attention to the coirupting mflu-
j ence of executive patronage, through the medium
of officers of executive  appointment, upon the
I elections of the country    President Jackson con-
, isidered it his duty to denounce the practice of
bringing the influence of executive pationage to
bear upon the freedom and purity of the elective
franchise     But, sir, did Mi   Jefferson ever con-
template the passage of a law to prohibit public
officers from freely expressing their opinions upon
all political questions, which they might think
proper to discuss>    Did he propose anything as
a remedy for the evil, more than the ej-ertion of
I a moral influence, the menace of Executive dig-
pleasure, to restrain the public officers from im-
' propei interference in elections?    Did the renort
i of the Senator from Missoun, the speech of the
Senator fiom Pennsylvania, theinaugu al«ddiess
of President Jackso i   the  reprrt of tht Senator
fiom bouth Carolina, piopo^e to check  thatin-
terftience by fines and peipetual dis-bi'i íes'
