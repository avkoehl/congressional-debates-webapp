25th Cong -"2nd Sess.                                    Neutral Jielations—Mr, Taylor.                 __________________________H. of Rep .
Detroit, for the avowed and open purpose of
invading the Canada shore?
[Mr. Me-iiffe here interposed, and asked why
this preparation had not been put down, etc ]
Mr P said he was not charged with executive
dut es on that frontier, and, not being answerable
for the execution of the laws, he could not give the
reasons; that it was not his place to do so; that he
did not know the local difficulties or causes, and
that it did not belong to him (Mr. P ) to detail the
reasons why these proceedings had not been at-
rested. Mr P. said he was tor giving as strong
executive power to preserve our peace and to sus-
tain oui obligations to foreign powers, as was
consistent with the law*, ol nations and our own
Constitution The gentleman from Pennsjlvama
(Mr. BiDDiE-)had objected lo the amendment ot
the gentleman irom Villana, (Mi Patton,) be-
cause it contained a pioviso declaring that it was
not intended to inteilete with the lights ot citizen-,
a- neutrals, to carry on any commeiee sanctioned
by the laws ot nations
Ha (Mr C ) could see no reasonable objection
to this proviso One objection raised to the origi-
nal bill, was that it abandoned oui rights in trade as
a neutral power This pun i-o was intended 'o i v
clude that torn Uimou, ind «as a simple dec lat t-
tion by thoeimmij pom i as in what wis ihi
spirit and iiiteiitii n ol the act This was not an
adjournment ol the question as to tlieiurhisol

but was the reverse. Much bad Ik in said a- to

circumstances, to claim that provis op azamst un-
reasonable seizure If our treaties and the la.v of
good iatth are binding, such a position would p-r-
sent a case for very reasonable seizure. By the
avowed designs of men under such circumstance-,
they dispense with the necessity and reason for an
affidavit, as in ordinary cases Their open con-
duct is the affidavit. As to the argument who is to
judge, this, Mr. P. contended, is an argument
which, if pushed to exuemmes, isagamsl all power
any where. There must, of nece-siiy, be -some of-
ficer constituted to judge when the pioper case
arises, and if he exx .etses his authority against the
spirit of the law, he himself is amenable
Mr P. said, if we cannot enfoice our obligations
under treaties lor want ol powi r m ihe Constitu-
tion, belter for us to have no lieaiies, and pioclaim

mended furthei provisions for this object; and, sir, it appears to
¡>e atlniuied by all, with the exception of that gentleman, that
■cttuu additional provisions are necessary, to carry fully into
effect the objects of the aci of 20lh of April, 1818 But the diffi-
culty seems to consist in providing the necessary and appro-
pnate remedy, without infringing the constitutional rights of
the citizens, or being too severe and rigid m exactions upon
them Upon this ground have been based most of the objec-
tions which have been urged against the Senate bill, and this,
Mr Tiaid, had constituted the chief objection, in his mind, to
that bill He believed that what additional legislation was ne-
cessary to maintain the policy of this Government, and enforce
our neutral obligations, should be embraced m as few, simple,
and plain provisions as possible, The law of 1818 embraces
almost all that seems to he necessary, aodanypowcrs conferred
by ihat act, having existed many yeara, and uniformly acqui-
oseod in, may bo considered as affording a safe precedent (or our
¡indent actum
Mr T said he had examined with some caie the different
ptopoinimi*! ulifeh have been made to amend the bill; and he
was heitei satislied with the amendment pioposed by the gen-
tiomm Horn ViiBluia, (Mr Patton,) with the proviso suggested
by tbo gtsnilennn iiom Geoigi t, (Mi Holsey,) which is added
to ilir amendment, than with cither the Senate bill, or any plan
which has been biurgestod 1 tie objoetion which has arisen
