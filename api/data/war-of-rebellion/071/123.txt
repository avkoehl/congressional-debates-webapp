Major-General HUNTER,

Cumberland, Md.:

Please report the positions and numbers of your forces, and when they will reach Harper's Ferry. The enemy has crossed the Potomac, and appears to be moving by Boonsborough and Middletown on Frederick. His advance, under Breckinridge, has crossed the Monocacy, and is moving on Urbana. Unless your forces move forward rapidly they will not be in time to be of much use.
