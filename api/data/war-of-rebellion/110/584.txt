HEADQUARTERS,Russellville, Tenn., December 28, 1863.

Major General W. T. MARTIN,

Commanding Cavalry:

I have the honor to inclose herewith copy of an answer* to your note of the 25th instant, the original of which the commanding general fears that you have not received. Your note of 4 a. m. to-day has been just received. The [sic] seems to be doing what you have been directed to do-concentrating upon detachments. Our trains are ordered to be protected by escorts from the infantry. If any should be in rear of you without such escorts at a time when you desire to make a movement with a viewof concentrating upon a particular point, you should order the trains in and proceed with your movement. More efficient protection will be given our trains by beating back the enemy at one point, even, than by having your forces distributed over the country in such a manner that you can donothing else than watch. Instead of running a line up the French Broad, it will be better to send scouts across it into Sevier County, and in that way keep yourself advised of any movement up the river on the south side. The commanding general desires that you will endeavor to get a scout over to Maryville, to ascertain definitely what has become of the forcesthat came up from Chattanooga, whether any of this force came to Knoxville, and how much of it; also what portion of it went back, and the names of its prominent commanders. The commanding general wishes also that you will proceed to concentrate your forces to regain your position, and prevent the enemy foraging on Mossy Creek for the supplies which you were expected to hold for our own use.

I am, general, very respectfully, your most obedient servant,

G. M. SORREL,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General.

HEADQUARTERS,Morristown, December 28, 1863.

Major General W. T. MARTIN,

Commanding Cavalry:

Yout note to Colonel Sorrel of to-day is received. The enemy's movements yesterday were to cover foraging parties, I presume. It will be well in future to have matters so arranged that you can throw your entire force, except pickets, in the enemy's rear when he moves out. But you should advise us before making the move, that we may be prepared to move out to meet the enemy should he attempt to dash through in this direction, and you should pursue if he comes in this direction, and endeavor to break him up before he can reach any of our trains that [may] be out foraging. If you can in this way concentrate upon a signle brigade, even, and break it up, you will demoralize the rest of the enemy's cavalry to such extent that you will be able to destroy the balance.

Most respectfully,

J. LONGSTREET,

Lieutennat-General.
