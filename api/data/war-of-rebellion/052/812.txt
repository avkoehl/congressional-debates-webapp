The corps of 14,000 or 15,000 men to be sent from here has the usual amount of artillery but no cavalry. If the artillery is not deemed necessary, the railroad transportation will be greatly diminished. Please answer.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Please send the infantry by brigades as fast as possible. Let the artillery follow at leisure. The great point is to have troops at Stevenson and Bridgeport, to secure those points and the railroad.
