Major-General HOOKER:

GENERAL: My infantry are all across the river. My batteries, ambulances, and trains are not yet up-cut off I suppose by Williams' train. Will you please send me word whether the batteries are to cross here, and if not, ask Major Reynolds to send to meet them, and direct them where to go to cross and meet me, also the ambulances, and trains. I have sent a staff officer after the batteries. I have just learned of another boat three miles up the river, and sent for it. With it I think in three hours a bridge could be made here that would cross anything. Shall it be done?
