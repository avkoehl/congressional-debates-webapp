NOVEMBER 7, 1863-4 p. m.

Major-General SEDGWICK,

Commanding Right Column:

The major-general commanding directs me to inform you that French has effected a crossing and lodgment at Kelly's Ford - one division already over. The indications are that the battle will be fought within a mile of Kelly's Ford. He desires to know the condition of things in your front; what the force of the enemy is, and how posted. If you are not confident of being able to cross to-night (Norman's Ford he indicates as probably the best point), he desires you to hold your command ready to be transferred to-night to Kelly's Ford, and cross there.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General, and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS THIRD CAVALRY DIVISION,Stevensburg, November 7, 1863-4. 30 p. m.

Lieutenant-Colonel SMITH,

Chief of Staff:

COLONEL: I have the honor to report that General Kilpatrick has driven the enemy out of Stevensburg and he is now retiring in the direction of Culpeper, and now is at the base of Pony Mountain. Large number of infantry of Ewell's Ford and Hill's corps passed through this place last night toward Culpeper. They were moving all night. He will hold this place until further orders, not deeming it prudent to advance farther. We have only encountered cavalry.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEORGE W. YATES,

Aide-de-Camp.
