HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS, December 11, 1864-6.15 p.m. (Received 6.20 p.m.)

Major-General MEADE:

The deserter has reached my headquarters. He belongs to the Sixth North Carolina, Lewis' brigade, Pegram's division. So far as he knows, Rodes' division is in the Valley. I will inquire of General Macy as to the mistake about the division.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, December 11, 1864-6.30 p.m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

Who does the deserters say now commands Rodes' division? Rodes was killed in the Valley at Winchester. If not Pegram or Gordon then it would indicate the arrival of a third division of Early's. Captain Paine has come in from Warren. Warren destroyed the road for twenty miles from the crossing of the Nottoway to Hicksford; encountered but little opposition from cavalry; saw no infantry, but found artillery in position and every evidence that the passage of the Meherrin would be disputed. Hill either staid at Dinwiddie or else went to Hicksford expecting Weldon was Warren's object.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND CORPS, December 11, 1864-7.15 p.m. (Received 7.20 p.m.)

Brigadier-General WILLIAMS:

The general officer of the day for the Sixth Corps reports as follows:

My officers on the picket-line report to me that the enemy added about one-third to the strength of his line this afternoon. The detail relieved by the one now on duty stated that the rebels had day before yesterday apparently moved troops from my front to their right (our left), and there are indications to-day of their return.
