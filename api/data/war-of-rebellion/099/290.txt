HEADQUARTERS TWENTIETH CORPS,Two Miles from Lawtonville, S. C., February 3, 1865.

Major General H. W. SLOCUM,

Commanding Left Wing:

GENERAL: I send by the bearer some dispatches that arrived in the night by the messenger sent by me to General Sherman. We reached this point last night, had a smart skirmish with about a brigade of Wheeler's cavalry, and a battery of artillery. They were driven away with a loss to us of 1 killed and 7 wounded. My advance occupied Lawtonville last night. We found the roads yesterday in fair condition, but the rain of to-day may make them worse. We shall get to Duck Branch Post-Office to-day, from whence I shall communicate with General Sherman.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. S. WILLIAMS,

Brevet Major-General, Commanding.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, Cross-Roads, February 3, 1865.

Brevet Major-General WILLIAMS,

GENERAL: I am directed by General Sherman to say that he desires you to halt in the vicinity, or at Duck Branch Post-Office, and to reconnoiter to your left, awaiting further orders.

With respect,

L. M. DAYTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

General WILLIAMS,

Commanding Twentieth Corps:

GENERAL: You may move your command by Allendale Post-Office to a position about Hayes', depending on two divisions Fifteenth Corps being at Buford's Bridge, Seventeenth Corps at Rivers' Bridge, and one division Fifteenth Corps at Angley's Post-Office. I will be at Angley's. I want you to seem to be moving on Barnwell. Report to me as often as possible your progress, and you would do well to march your men on the flanks of your train, especially when abreast of Erwinton.

Yours,

W. T. SHERMAN,
