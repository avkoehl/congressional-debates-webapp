Colonel WILLIAM GAMBLE,

Commanding at Fairfax Court-House:

Firing has been reported in the direction of Page Valley, supposed to be between detachment from General Sheridan's army at Charlottesville, guarding prisoners to our lines, and Rosser. Rosser and Mosby have probably between 600 and 1,000 men. General Hancock has sent a cavalry force to Front Royal to assist, if need be, the party with prisoners. Send a strong detachment, under a competent officer, to Warrenton, to examine toward Luray and Sperryville and aid, if occasion offers, our people. Acknowledge receipt.

By command of Major-General Augur:
