Kentucky. Why not Buell? It is important we should feel safe in our rear. Any officer of rank (not a Kentuckian) would be better than Burbridge, who has politics in his head.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

LEXINGTON, KY., May 19, 1864.

Major General W. T. SHERMAN,

Dalton, Ga.:

I have a force of nearly 5,000 mounted men now organized to move through Pound Gap toward Abingdon. A part of this force is already at Pound Gap, the remainder is under orders to rendezvous at a point on the Big Sandy near Pikeville.

S. G. BURBRIDGE,

Brigadier-General, Commanding District of Kentucky.

LEXINGTON, May 19, 1864.

Governor Thomas E. BRAMLETTE,

Frankfort, Ky.:

Will it be possible for you to let me have another regiment of militia in Northeastern Kentucky in addition to those forwarded by General Lindsey? General Ewing needs more troops also in his district, and the regiments of militia placed under his order at once will be of great service. The regiments, if called out promptly, will give security to the State during the absence of a large part of my command on a proposed expedition. There are some indications that the enemy propose a raid on this State from the neighborhood of Pound Gap. Answer.

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Colonel J. W. WEATHERFORD,

Burkesville, Ky.:

I leave for the mountains of Kentucky and Virginia to-morrow with my mounted force. Take care of the Cumberland border, and watch for movement through your lines. Keep your detachments well together and in a position to concentrate at a moment's notice.

E. H. HOBSON,

Brigadier-General.
