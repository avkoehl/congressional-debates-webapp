as practicable, in such other companies as were originally raised in the county or district from which the militia came. This would place a portion at least of that residue in some of the regiments of Floyd's brigade, and as you will have more than enough to fill your own companies, I would suggest that such of the militia as have already volunteered with regiments of Floyd's brigade from that section of the State be permitted to remain in such regiments. This can be accomplished by not taking such of the militia as have volunteered into regiments from your section other than your own until you have exhausted those who have not so volunteered.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE,

General.

Brig. General DANIEL S. JOHNSON:

GENERAL: The general commanding directs me to say that on reflection the troops of your command will not repair to Rienzi, but you will be retained here. This includes the South Carolina regiment. You will therefore report for further orders to General Bragg.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

THOMAS JORDAN,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
