BWi. OF THE UNITED STATES.
The following resolution, submitted by Mr.
Bevtov, and lying on the table, was taken up for
consideration*
Resolved, That the Committee on Finance be
msiiucted to obtain fiom the Bank of the United
States a copy of all instructions, if any, to the
branch banks, diiectmg them to collect and remit
Spanish milled dollars to the mother bank, the
number of such dolíais annually remrtted, the
rates at which they sold at different peiiods, (say
at or about the beginning of each quartei of the
year,) whethei the Bank of the United States has
sold such dollars to the United States, and, if so,
how many, and at what rates, how many it has
sold to otheis, or expoited to foreign countij.es,
also, a statement of the amount of gold coin, of
the amount of silver com, and the amount of bul-
lion, remitted to the mothpr bank, or elsewhere,
by hei ordei, annual'y, since the 1st day of April,
1832, also, a statement showing the amount of
silver com and of gold com remitted by the mother
bank to each bianch since that day, also, the
amount of gold com and the amount of silver
coin annually sold, or annually exported, by the
bank, since the said 1st day of Apnl, also, a
statement of the amount of gold received from
the United States Mint since the 1st day of
August last, and a statement of the whole amount
of gold on hand in the bank and its branches,
for each month, fiom April 1, 1832, to the present
time.
Mr TYLER said he defied to say but a woid
on this subject    He had no sort of objection to
the inquiiy,and wished to be so distinctly under-
stood.   The material allegation in the resolution
was in reference to the conduct which the bank
had puisued relative to the currency and com of
the United States, the call was for information
on this" subject      \.m\ he begged leave to say to
the Senate, that this mattei was made the subject
of specific inquiry by the committee of investiga-
tion of 1832  The Committee on Finance, dunng
the last summei, having ascertained that the sub-
ject was fully inquiied into in  1832, caiefully
examined and analyzed the report, and he was
ready now to affirm that the  counter íeport,
which was then made, was so conclusive that it
had relieved the committee  fiom the labor of
prosecuting their inquines into that subject.    In
leference to the bank bartering in the currency of
the country, he thought that charge had been
answeied by the exhibit appended to the report
of the Committee on Finance.   He thought that
by that exhibit it was shown, that  this  traffic
could not have been cai ned on    But if the honor-
able gentleman from Missouu thought that any-
thin  could come out of the inquiry, he had no
objection to it     He (Mr  T ) was ready to con-
demn the bank in all things in which it should
have eued, he was no friend of the bank, and
when we came to measure facts, it would be seen
that he stood so high in opposition to the bank
tint he was not to be shaken by anything which
should yet take place   Tt was not necessaiy for
him to make this disclaimei, but it came in his
way, and he had given utteiance to it.   But the
honorable gentleman from Missouri might have
information which the committee did not possess,
I and he (Mi  T ) was willing it sh mid be shown.
Mi    BENTON asked leave of the Senate to
1 amend the resolution by conecting a date in it.
All the letuins asked for came up to the 31st of
I January, 1831      He wished to mseit that day
instead of the 1st of Aptil     As to the subject-
mattei of the call, he would only say that it would
be haidly light to mention the information on
which he made the call     He might, to be sure,
be.mistaken in his information, and if it should
so appear, he would have no more to say on the
subject     As to the honorable gentleman s situ-
ation with íefeience to the committee and the
| bank, he (Mr  B ) pmyed God to grant him safe
deliverance—his   situation    seemed   sompthmg
[ wmse than walking on eggs, (to use an old max-
im,) or treading on buimig plowshares      But
I it was probable we should be able to measuie
facis before long
Mr TYLER lephed, that the honorable gen-
tleman fiom Missouri need not feel the slightest
1 concern for his ddiverance He was delivered
fiom Jaeksomsm-he thanked God he had got
ud of that He had, fiom his mothei 's lap, been
lanoht an old adage, which he should cling to
thiSugh life, that m all matters, political as well
as otheis, "honesty was the best policy.
