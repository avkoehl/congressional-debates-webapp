SEDGWICK,

General.

(Repeated to General Hooker.)

MAY 2, 1863-10.05 a.m.

General HOOKER:

Sedgwick says has not dared to take up bridges at Franklin's. Reynolds' bridge ought not to be taken away until after dark; it may cost the loss of many boats. Asks shall bridges at Franklin's be taken up at dark without further instructions.+ Desires above communicated.
