of engineers? If made full brigadier it would settle the question. Michie and Jackson deserve the promotion. Shall Lieutenant-Colonel Smith, adjutant-general, Twenty-fifth Army corps, now acting assistant adjutant-general this department, go with his corps, or remain here as chief assistant adjutant-general department, which I recommend be done. General Weitzel has applied for the appointment of Major Wheeler as assistant adjutant-general of his corps and he is on duty with it.

Washington, D. C.:

What shall I do with the Naval Brigade-Thirteenth New York Heavy? You broke it up once. 'Tis of no use now, and as all the seamers save one, are owned by Government, they are wanted as transports. Should be turned in the Quartermaster's Department.

Major-General ORD,

Richmond, Va.:

Jackson is promoted full brigadier. Michie will have to go with the corps. Lieutenant-Colonel Smith can remain in the department, and Major Wheeler take his place in the corps. Does Michie command troops?

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

RICHMOND, VA., May 19, 1865.

Lieutenant General U. S. GRANT:

Michie is chief engineer of the army and department, commanding engineer troops. I will give him a district or division if promoted. Want him here very much. He is modest and poor; could hardly be kept back when fighting was going on. Is only a lieutenant of regulars, but Weitzel and I gave him inspector ship of Twenty-fifth Corps to help him support mother and sisters and his brevet of brigadier. Wetzel has Kress, of the ordnance, acting inspector-general, and can dispense with Michie who deserves the full grade as much as any one in my command.

E. O. C. ORD,

Major-General.
