There are two regiments of heavy artillery with the Sixth Army Corps which have been retained for the garrison of Washington. This will be enough. The order, therefore, for you to send another will be suspended.

The cavalry regiments are included, but they must leave their horses and equipments here. The 100-days' men you need not send.

CITY POINT, VA., July 18, 1864.

(Received 10.50 p. m.)

Major-General MEADE:

I have the report of a refugee, who has just come in to the gun-boats, who says that Lee is said to have left the south side and gone, leaving Beauregard and Longstreet. Some say he has gone to the Valley, and others say he has gone south. Have you had any deserters from Hill's corps in the last twenty-four hours?

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, July 18, 1864 - 11.30 p. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Seven deserters from the Sixty-fourth Georgia Regiment, Wright's brigade, Mahone's division, Hill's corps, came into our lines between 2 and 3 o'clock this morning. They men were questioned and know nothing of any movements or change of position of their corps, nor had they heard of the corps having six days' cooked rations, as reported by deserters from Longstreet's corps last night. I should think the refugee's story was a camp rumor.

GEO. G. MEADE,Major-General, Commanding.
