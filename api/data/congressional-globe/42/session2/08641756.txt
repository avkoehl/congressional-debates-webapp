THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
March 18,
invite an immense increase of imports and con-
sequently compel a reduction of domestic pro-
duction. The coal of Indiana is doubtless very
superior, and it lies very near to the ores of
Missouri, and is quite accessible to those of
Michigan; but we will wait until this tide of
free trade has brought about ruin, and we can
buy in cheaply at forced sales, and when pov-
erty will also compel men to work for lower
wages; then we may go into business with a
prospect of success." The mere consideration
of such a scheme is already checking enter-
prise, and to enact it into a law would com-
pletely paralyze it.
Those who are old enough to remember
1857-60, and preeminently those who can
remember 1834-40, as I can, when for nine
months I walked the streets of my native eity,
and would have been glad to earn a half a
dollar on any day, and could find no man who
could give me work or wages, though I en
joyed the reputation of being a quick and
skillful workman; it was the first year of
freedom from mv indentures, and I grieved
that I had not, come into the world one year
later than 1 had done, that the home of the
worthy gentleman to whom I had been in-
dentured might have sheltered me during
those terrible months; keenly do I still re-
member the agony I endured at finding that
witli manhood I had become a charge upon
members of my family, who cheerfully sup-
plied my simple wants and kept me from
despairâ€”those, I say, who can remember
the eras referred to, who are now in business,
will be admonished by the passage of such a
law to take in sail. No new hands will be
employed, or new enterprises entered upon.
The immigrant coming here will find himself
idle, and the tide of immigration will ebb.
Gradually the people in employment will be
discharged, as cheap goods from Belgium,
France, the Zollverein, and Great Britain
crowd the more costly domestic goods out of
the market. I query, sir, whether the mechanics
of the United States will call that system which
deprives them of a market for their skill and
labor, the only property they have to sell, free
trade.
And then, what? Then will begin contrac-
tion, sir, contraction such as Congress could not
inaugurate by direct financial legislation. And
why? During the last eleven years, under a
protective tariff, with the duties increased by
the difference between paper and gold, our
industries have expanded, and the increased
cost of articles to the consumer has largely
gone in increase of wages to the laborer. Our
laborers are not indolent, or dissolute, or
drunken. They know the value of home.
They cherish wife and children. They dream
of leaving behind them a little home in which
the widow a.nd orphan children shall be domi-
ciled after the dread summoner shall have
called them hence. And to secure this they
make timely provision. Go to the savings
banks of New England, New York, New Jer-
sey, Pennsylvania, or of the western States,
where cheap lands tempt to that, form of invest-
ment, and you will find that the amount de-
posited by oar laborers is more than the entire
Volume of greenbacks. It is now invested by
the savings banks in bonds and mortgages on
real estate, in Government loans, and the
loans of corporate companies. If those depos-
its should be withdrawn, as they must be when
an influx of cheap foreign goods shall deprive
Our laborers of work, mortgages must be called
in, bonds must be sold, and the commercial
classes simultaneously called upon for heavy
payments, and deprived of usual bank accom-
modations, will feel the effects. These work-
ing men have on deposit nearly four hundred
million dollars. Compel them by throwing
them into idleness to draw upon their reserve,
to eat up their deposits, and where will your
capitalist or your business men get the money
with which to conduct business^ or find a pay-
ing market for heavy importatious ? Congress
cannot by any other means compel such a con-
traction of the currency as would be felt in one
year if it should deprive the laboring people
of work in the mines, factories, forges, and
furnaces of this country, and throw them upon
their deposits in the savings bunks.
The gentleman from Indiana may say his
bill does not involve such consequences. I say
that it does; and therein I express my opinion
honestly as he expresses his. And as a proof
of the correctness of my position I cite expe-
rience of the periods to which I have re-
ferred. I cite Ireland as a perpetual witness,
and Turkey as another. India furnishes per-
haps still more striking proof that free trade
is but another name for Biiiish monopoly. Ire-
land has enjoyed free trade, and what is she ?
Where are her eight millions of people ? In 1840
they were happy upon the green isle. Ah, sir.
one million went to the grave from starvation
and diseases resulting from inadequate food;
and other millions have fled, and the takers of
the last census found little more than live mil
lions of tliem upon the island. Turkey I Why,
sir, the system under which Turkey has been
made the sick man of Europe, and is kept in
a condition which allows no convalescence, is
tender to her people compared with that which
the gentleman from Indiana would inflictupon
us. Turkey imposes eight per cent, taxes on
her products and levies eight per cent, pro-
tective duties ; and there she is, the hopeless
dependent of Great Britain, who ha
her legislation for half a century. The gen-
tleman, not content with eight per cent, pro-
tective duties, would maintain $140,000,000
of internal taxes, would impose high duiic-s
on every element of life and manufacture that
we cannot produce, and would reduce to a
" revenue standard he calls it, the duties
on all things that we do produce. In his own
emphatic language, he would "protect noth-
ing ;" no, sir, not even the right ot the Amer-
ican laborer to home and food!
I find that I have trespassed very far upon
the patience of those who have done me the
honor to listen to me at this late hour of the
day; and I shall not go further except to say
to the gentleman that it it he true that the duty
on coal, which produces $u00,000 a year, im-
poses, as he says it does, a tax of $18,000,000
on the people, theie is a worse hardship im-
posed upon the miners of that coal and other
laborers who are taxed by tile duties on agri-
cultural! products; for I find by examining
the tables that in order to get $1,05-5,295 80
into the Treasury by duties on wheat, lye,
oats, Indian corn, barley, buckwheat, and
potatoes, we pay to the farmers, according to
the gentleman's theory, (I denythe theorym
toto, and denounce it as false, fallacious,
delusive.) a bonus on those seven articles of
$179,336,851 37. How could the gentleman's
argument be more effectually reduced to an
absurdity? The correctness of my figures is
shown by the following table:

I now leave the question till the Commit-
tee of Ways and Means shall have reported a
bill. The gentleman and I will then " meet at

Mr. D DELL moved that the House do now

The motion was agreed to; and (at five
o'clock and forty minutes p. m.) the House
adjourned.

Mr. COLE, I present the memorial of the
officers of the Academy of Science of Califor-

and of other scientific institutions of that State,
appealing to Congress to make liberal provis-
ions for the observai ion of the transit ol Venus
across the dise of the sun, to take place in

nations have already made liberal provision
