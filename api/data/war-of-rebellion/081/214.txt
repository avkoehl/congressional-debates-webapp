(Same to Generals Warren and Martindale.)
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS, June 19, 1864.

General WILLIAMS,Assistant Adjutant-General:

The wounded were not entirely removed during the night. I have been trying to get an approximate estimate of the number remaining on the field. General Mott reports that only a few belonging to the Third Brigade of Second Division are still out. I expect to hear every moment from General Gibbon, and will telegraph further. As to the dead, I learn that a considerable number remain unburied between the lines.

D. B. BIRNEY,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS, June 19, 1864.

General WILLIAMS,Assistant Adjutant-General:

General Gibbon reports that Colonel Smyth's brigade left some of its wounded very near the enemy's works, and that others were wounded in the attempt to get them off. It is probable that a considerable number of dead remain between the lines.

Major-General.
