THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
February 18,
and. they have reduced fx-om year to year until
they have brought down the expenditures of the
Government, including the Post Office deficiency,
and including the interest on the publio debt last
year, to something under §59,000,000. Deduct
from that the $3,500,000—I speak in round num-
bers—for the support of the Post Office, and it
would reduce it to between fifty-five and fifty-six
million dollars.
I maintain that under such circumstances as
these, gentlemen-ought to show us some necessity
before we are required to raise these $21,000,000,
or even $10,000,000. As far as we can see, there
ought to be $9,000,000 in the Treasury at the end
of this fiscal year; and that surely ought to suf-
fice them, especially if this tariff, which I suppose
will be passed, is to yield the large excess of
revenue which the Senator from Rhode Island
estimates. I think he said it was to give us
$20,000,000 more than the present tariff. If it
yielded anything like that rate, with $9,000,000
of surplus on the 1st of July, the Government
ought to be able to get along. Now, I am will-
ing to vote what is necessary to carry on the Gov-
ernment, but I believe thr t a due regard for econ-
omy, for prudence, and a due desire to keep up
■the public credit, require us not to go into the
market for more loans than are absolutely neces-
sary; at any rate, not to proclaim to the world
the necessity for this large amount of debt, unless
indeed it can be shown to exist.
Mr. SIMMONS. In the course of my remarks
the other day, I believe I stated that I had then
a statement signed by the officers of the Treasury
of the amount expended the first three years under
this tariff, and it reached an average of $66,000,000
a year, exclusive of the payments on account of
the interest on the public debt. I do not know
what statement the Senator has based his calcu-
lation upon, by which he says that the Secretary
ofthe Treasury calculates weshall have $9,000,000
at the end of this fiscal year. I have seen no such
statement any where, except the one from the past
Secretary. Perhaps lie may have made that esti-
mate.
Mr. HUNTER. I did not say the Secretary
had estimated that. I say that upon the expend-
itures, if we expend no more than we did last
year, the means already provided ought to give
$9,000,000.
Mr. SIMMONS. During the last four years,
every time 1 have taken up the Treasury returns
and undertaken to show by them that we were
not getting money enough to pay the expenses of
the Government, the Senator from Virginia has
invariably had papers showing that we were ac-
tually getting enough, and that we should soon
have a surplus. I do not know where he gets
these estimates. I know the fact that we have
hired about $63,000,000; and we have expended
the $23,000,000 of money that was on hand when
this Administration took power. The last time I
conversed with the Secretary of the Treasury, he
told me that the loan of $25,000,000 just author-
ized was what he estimated would be required for
the present fiscal year, to go to the 30th of June
next, and take up all the "Treasury notes which
fall due within that period, not considering the
$10,000,000 duo next January. That is all he
talked of taking up. There is a provision in an-
other loan bill authorizing the negotiation of
$10,000,000 to take up the Treasury notes due
next January. That leaves us with nothing but
the current receipts for the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1802, the receipts under this bill, and
what we may get from public lands. Without
this loan, our indebtedness is$88,000,000. That
is what we havepiovided for. We have provided
$10,000,000 to take up the Treasury notes due
next January. We have provided $25,000,000 to
pay the current expenses to next June, and re-
deem the former issues of Treasury notes that
are out. We had a loan of $20,000,000 under the
act of June, 1858. Seven million dollars were
taken under the loan bill of June, 1860. These
sums make $63,000,000; and besides there is about
$25,000,000 or $20,000,000 of old debt yet unpaid.
Ihatis the condition that we are in now. Sup-
posing that I was mistaken about the Post Office
balances, there were still $66,000,000 a year spent.
1 cannot be mistaken as to what was spent the
last three years, because I have it from the books.
It was about $6(5,000,000, exclusive of interest
on the public debt. That now amounts to about
$5,500,000, which,added to the $66,000,000, makes
$71,500,000, chargeable upon the Government,
provided there is no diminution of expenditures
next year from what there was last year. That
is plain ciphering. The Senator from Virginia
stated, in his speech the other day, that he would
venture his reputation that this bill would not give
$56,000,000 next year. He intimated that I said
it would; but I never made any estimate of what
it would give next year. I said it would give, on
such an amount of importations as we have had
for the last three years, over $60,000,000 a year.
Mr. HUNTER. Did not the Senator say it
would yie|d $20,000,000 more than the tariff bill
of 1857, on the data of the last fiscal year?
Mr. SIMMONS. No, sir. Taking the four
years that we have had of the present tariff, tak-
ing the estimates as they are up to the end of this
fiscal year, and it has not averaged $45,000,000.
For the first half of the present year, it yielded
$24,000,000, and it is estimated for the second half
at $16,000,000. That makes $40,000,000. That,
of course, reduces the average of the other years.
1 think this bill will yield $65,000,000 of income
in prosperous years. That is my opinion about
it, but 1 do not expect $65,000,000 from it next
year. What I say is, that we have got to provide
for what the falling off in the imports will be for
the next fiscal year in this bill, provided the tariff
would support the Government under ordinary
circumstances. That is manifest enough to every-
body. I expect this bill, under the ordinary cir-
cumstances of this country, to yield ample reve-
nue to pay the ordinary expenses of the Govern-
ment; and I hope that gradually, by economy, we
can extinguish the public debt under it; but I
would not undertake to say, nor do 1 think it
prudent to estimate, for the next fiscal year, an
amount of revenue under this tariff equal to the
ordinary amount of importations. I do not be-
lieve the Senator from Virginia thinks we shall
import next year as much as we have ordinarily
done; and if we are not likely to have those im-
ports, I should like to ask him, if he does not think
it proper, as Congress is not to be together again
for the next nine months, to make suitable pro-
v.sion for the exigencies oftthe Government? This
section is so amended that the- loan is not to be
negotiated, unless the public cxigchcies require it.
That is a provision in it.
Mr. HUNTER. Does the Senator limit it to
be negotiated in the next fiscal year, or does he
allow it to be negotiated in this? Will he limit
the right to negotiate it to the next fiscal year?
Mr. SIMMONS. I have no sort of objection
to that. It says within twelve months from the
passage of the law. I do not suppose this money
can be negotiated until after the other loans are
disposed of. The remainder of the $25,000,000
loan authorized the other day will have to be ne-
gotiated in this fiscal year, because it is for the
requirements of this fiscal year; but after that,
there will be nine months in which this bill will
permit this loan to be negotiated. I have no
means of knowing, more than any other Senator,
what the condition of this country is to be forthe
fiscal year ending Juno 30,1862; but 1 know that
if we should get a surplus, there are about
$3,000,000of an old loan that will fallduein 1862;
and the Senator knows that the present Secretary
of the Treasury is not calculating to leave in the
Treasury, at the expiration of this Administration,
$1,000,000. Will he pretend to say that this Gov-
ernment can go on and be administered conve-
niently with $1,000,000 for Mint purposes, or the
purposes of the Treasury? He knows it cannot.
Mr. HUNTER. Does the Senator say that
the Secretary of the Treasury declares thatif what
he asks be given, we shall only have $1,000,000
at the end ofthe year?
Mr. SIMMONS. I said this: that he designed
to raise enough during the continuance of this'
Administration to pay what was due before the
4th of March, anil leave $1,000,000 in the Treas-
ury. That is what 1 said.
Mr. HUNTER. It leaves nearly the whole
$25,000,000 to be negotiated whenever they want
it.
Mr, SIMMONS. But what I speak of is that
he has estimated not to leave anything m the
Treasury. He has only estimated, when he had ,
$3,000,000 in the Treasury, for what was actually j
to be paid, and he took the $2,000,000 towards !
paying it, net leaving anything in the Treasury |
on the 1st of July, if he pays all that he intended
to pay. We certainly ought to have some means
in the Treasury. I should think Senators, if they
took notice of the condition of our public finances,
would be willing to do what was necessary, that
the public creditors should not have to wait from
week to week and month to month, before they
could have a requisition made upon any depos-
itory of public moneys. When 1 was there last,-*
there was over $1,800,000 from a single Depart-
ment waiting for payment, and there was no
money to pay them. I have no kind of dispo-
sition to ask for more loans; I have made this as
low as I think could be anywise got around,and
I trust it will be voted. We ought to have at least
fiom $4,000,000 to $6,000,000 in the Treasury.
The Senator from Virginia, three years ago last
December, said it required $12,000,000. I did not
believe it then, and do not believe it now; but I
think the $3,000,000 or $4,000,000, to carry on the
Mint operations with facility and convenience, is
as little as we can get along with.
Mr. HUNTER. The Senator from Rhode
Island has fallen into a mistake in regard to Mr.
Dix's estimates. He estimates that it will take
$21,677,524 to carry on the Government until the
end of the year; and that is exclusive of the bal-
ance which is now on hand, evidently assuming
that that is to leave a working surplus at the end
of the year. Now, the Senator from Rhode
Island says that I estimated that there ought to
be some $6,000,000 for the Mint and $6,000,000
to work the Treasury. I believe that, in times
when it is easy to raise money, it is well to have
$5,000,000 or $6,000,000; it is convenient to have
that surplus in order to work the Treasury. In re-
gard to the Mint fund, that may have been over-
estimated; and I believe we have now intro-
duced a provision by law to receive refined bars,
in payment of public debts, at | per cent, dis-
count. That will dispense with the necessity
for the Mint fund to a great extent. I have just
shown -by the figures that we shall have, after
paying the $21,000,000 of Treasury notes,
$68,000,000 to apply to the expenditures of this
fiscal year. I have shown that, during the last
year, exclusive of the Post Office deficiency for
that year, we expended less than $59,000,000, in-
cluding the intereston the public debt. Now, I say
that, unless we spend more this year than we did
last, there ought to be a surplus at the end ofthe
year, if we negotiate all this loan, of something
like $9,000,000.
Mr. SIMMONS. jUlow me to ask the Sena-
tor one question. On what data does he predicate
that we shall have $68,000,000 or $69,000,000 for
this year's expense?
Mr. HUNTER. I have justgiven it; but I will
give it to the Senator again. Here is the state-
ment: according to Secretary Cobb's annual re-
port, there was on hand on the 1st of July last,
$3,629,206. In the first quarter we received ftom
public lands, customs, and miscellaneous sources,
$17,719,790; in the second quarter, including the
same sources, and $6,870,000 of the loan nego-
tiated by Mr. Cobb, $15,520,000. Then Mr. Dix
estimates that we shall receive from these sources,
exclusive of the $5,000,000 of Treasury notes,
during the last two quarters, $17,400,000. These
sums added together make $54,209,850. Add to
that the $10,000,000 of Treasury notes authorized
in December, 1850, and the $25,000,000 loan au-
thorized the other day, and you have $89,269,850.
Deduct from that $21,000,000 of Treasury notes
that are to bp redeemed by this sum, and it leaves
us $68,269,000 to be applied to the expenditures
of this year. I have just shown from Mr. Cobb's
report that last year the expenditures were under
§59,000,000, and that, counting one year's defi-
ciency for the Post Office Department, the interest
on the public debt, and all the other expenditures.
Now, I say that if we got alons last year with
$59,000,000, or a little under it, we ought to get
along this year for the same sum; and if we do,
then, substracting $59,000,000 from $68,000,000,
we ought to have $9,000,000 surplus at the end of
this fiscal year.
Mr. SfMMONS. I want to reply to that.
Mi. POWELL. If the Senator from Rhode
Island will allow me, I will move that the Senate
adjourn. It is five o'clock.
^ The question being put on the motion to ad-
journ, there were, on a division—ayes 11, noes
21; no quorum voting.
