Numbers 2. Report of Captain John S. Mosby, Virginia Cavalry.

NEAR PIEDMONT, VA.,

March 18, 1863.

GENERAL: Yesterday I attacked a body of the enemy's cavalry at Herndon Station, in Fairfax County, completely routing them. I brought off 25 prisoners-a major (Wells), 1 captain, 2 lieutenants, and 21 men, all their arms, 26 horses and equipments. One, severely wounded, was left on the ground. The enemy pursued me in force but, were checked by my rear guard, and gave up the pursuit. My loss was nothing.

The enemy have moved their cavalry from Germantown back of Fairfax Court-House, on the Alexandria pike.

In this affair my officers and men behaved splendidly.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNO. S. MOSBY,

Captain, Commanding.
