Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.

WHITEVILLE, February 21, 1865.

General R. F. HOKE:

I have seen the superintendent of this road, Captain Drane, who states that events have occurred since your telegram of the 19th, which, in his opinion, precludes the arrival of my train. Please answr immediately at this point if it is proper for me to come on.

J. R. TUCKER,

Flag Officer.

WILMINGTON, February 21, 1865.

Captain J. R. TUCKER,

Whiteville:

You should remain at Whiteville to check any advance of the enemy if possible, and fall back before him for the protection of the Fayetteville arsenal. Send all stores back.

BRAXTON BRAGG.

WHITEVILLE, February 21, 1865.

General BRAGG:

Telegram received. I have 350 sailors unused to marching. No artillery or transportation for stores or baggage. Have a train here on which I propose to move to Cheraw, and thence to Charlotte. All store trains are going back. I do not think the small force can check enemy, and propose leaving in any direction you think best after sending my sick trains. Please answer immediately. I would suggest the Cheraw route for the sake of transportation for baggage.

J. R. TUCKER,

Flag Officer, Commanding.

With Hardee's troops at once I feel sure we can hold the place and get them by Wilmington. Will answer fully when I see Major Cross, who I suppose is on the way, from your dispatch.

HEADQUARTERS HOKE'S DIVISION,February 21, 1865.

Major PARKER:

You must inform General Hardee in my name the true state of affairs. Be careful not to allow the dispatch to fall into the hands of the enemy.
