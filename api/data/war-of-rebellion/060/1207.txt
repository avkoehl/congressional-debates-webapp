PETERSBURG, VA., March 3, 1864.

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General:

I have ordered the cavalry companies which were to assemble at High Bridge to go to Richmond at once. Will you let me know immediately whether the danger in that neighborhood has passed? I want the City Battalion returned. There are no troops here. Two regiments of Clingman's (number 1,400 muskets - more than Kemper's whole brigade) are now leaving here; that leaves this place entirely unguarded. Answer.

G. E. PICKETT,

Major-General.
