Major MELTON,

Major MILTON BURCH,

Eighth Missouri State Militia Cavalry:

You will immediately upon receipt of this order Major Morgan and Captain Ray with their commands to proceed by forced marches to Springfield. If in your opinion you can hold Neosho ten days with 200 men, you will order all the troops above that number to Springfield at once. The enemy are at Sedalia, moving south. You cannot hold Neosho with your battalion if Price moves that way, hence the necessity of sending every man not needed for immediate defense to hold Springfield. In any event send Major Morgan's and Captain Ray's commands to this place at once and hold yourself in readiness at Neosho to move at a moment's notice. Keep out scouts in every direction and don't be surprised, by, and keep Fayetteville advised of the movements of, the enemy. When you have reliable information that Price is moving on Neosho let the post go and save your command.

Colonel HARRISON:

The enemy are at Sedalia moving south. I propose keeping Major Galloway here. If matters get worse he will enable me to keep you posted. If you will remain at Cassville for the purpose of keeping up communication I will keep the operator there. You can lose nothing by remaining at Cassville.

J. D. BRUTSCHE,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
