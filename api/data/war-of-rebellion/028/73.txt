OFFICER Commanding BRIGADES FROM BURNSIDE'S CORPS,

Monocacy Junction:

General Burnside was directed yesterday to send two brigades, by railroad, to Monocacy Junction, to remain in cars ready to move, at a moment's notice, to any point that the enemy might cross the railroad. In now appears that the enemy crossed the railroad this morning at Monrovia, and no report has been received at these

headquarters that your command has made the least effort to stop the progress of the enemy.

The commanding general directs that you at once report where your command is at this time, and what you have been doing since you arrived at Monocacy Junction. I sent you two dispatches to-day, ordering you to send back there regiments to the Point of Rocks for the purpose of preventing the rebels from getting back into Virginia, but as yet I get no reply from you.

Chief of Staff.

Brigadier General GEORGE CROOK, Hancock:

The enemy's cavalry have recrossed into Virginia near the mouth of the Monocacy. You will, therefore, order back your brigade from McConnellsburg to Hancock, and proceed to Clarksburg, according to your original orders. Please forward the accompanying dispatch to General Averell.*

Major General WILLIAM B. FRANKLIN, Hagerstown:

Pleasonton reports that Stuart's cavalry recrossed into Virginia, near the mouth of the Monocacy, to-day, having marched over 90 miles in the previous twenty-four hours. Pleasonton overtook them at the river, with their artillery in position, but could not accomplish much aloe, owing to his artillery horses being used up by their rapid pursuit of 78 miles, and behind unable to follow

rapidly at the last, though the rebel battery was silenced and driven off.

Full result not yet reported.
