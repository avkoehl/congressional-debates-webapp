The country was thus burdened with a long ana permanent
national debt in profound peace All our farms will be mort-
gaged forever, and that generally to foreigners We alsovio

and thus vacillate in a month to the other side of the compass
Wet iww off or postpone six or ten millions for a whole gene
ration Ample details were given on these points The Presi-
dent's land message was highly commended On one side
there was prudence, caution, ordinary usage, on the other, no-
velties, expenmerts,sacnfices, disappointments, and ruin, wider
and deeper    Our bane and antidote are both before u¡>
fThs speech will be given in full hereafter    The above is
onlv a s celetoi of some few of the points urged in it
Mr PR'STON expressed a desire to speak on the subject
* pending, but
Mi MAN GUM observed thathe understood there were other
gentlemen on his side intended to speak if afforded the opp«r
tunity, aid it was now so near 3 o'clock, that it was evident the
debate could not be closed this evening He therefore thought
it would be best to adjourn
Mr CALHOUN intimated his intention to address the
Senate for a short time on the passage of the bill
After a shoi t consultation, not heard m the Reporter's gal
lerv, Mr. Mangum's proposition to adjourn was withdrawn,
and,
Mr PRESTON proceeded with his remarks He took a
cursory review of the present condition of the Government,
and urged the necessity of immediate action tor its relief lie
attnbu'ed the discredit of the Government to the outstand
jng treasury notes of the late Administration, and the
financial policy pursued by it while in charge of the
Go/eminent It was in consequence of the iniquitous ten-
ue icy of that policy that the Whig party had been «o unani
mousfy calle! into power, and foi the purpose of changing it
and establishing a sounder system lint when tiie Whigs did
obtain the reins of Government they had to take them under
great and embanassmg difficulties They hadan empty Trea-
sury, an accumulation of postponed duties of Government, a
large unfunded debt calling for immediate payment, a de
creasing tariff and no sufficient law to provide adequate means
for carrying on the public husmeas To remedy all this
was the work of time The consequence of such a
state of things was seen in the present want of credit and the
imperative necessity which ealls for the immediate passage of
this bill. The crisis is now come that there can be no longer
postponement, even for a day There is no alternative between
this measure and a resort to Treasury notes Would the ¡^e-
nator from New Hampshire [M' Woodeury] now propose a
new issue of Treasury notes, to raise the means necessary to re
lieve the Government from us piesent difficulties'?
Mr WOODBURY said he would not issue another dollar of
T eisuiynoius but he wouid authorize a loan, founded on a
pledge of the pioeeeds of the public lands, to fundj-he Treasury
note* already outstanding
Mr PRJEslOiV observed that it was then evident no one
continued to advocate the jfieaamy note system, and that u a
nuneiK assent was given to the alternalive of a funded debt
This wis the policy winch the Whigs had promised as the only
way to*get n I of the Tieasury note sy^em—a system which
broke down the late Administration
He contended that the Administration now in power had
been but thirteen months in existence, and this was the fiist regu-
lar session of Congress that the Whigs had had an/ oppoi tunity
of maturing their policy Then action could only be conei lei
ed prospective, not íetrospecme, lot they could not go hack
and undo alt tho evil that had been done by the late Admmia
tration
The gentlemen opposite were very ready, now that they had
plunged their successors m a seauf difficulties, to tell die world
that if thoy had been allowed to continue in p ¡sseasion ofpowei
even but a year or two longer, they would have established
economy hvietrenchments, freed the Government from debt,
and avoided all necessity furincreased taxation And it must
be confessed they exhibited great zeal m this work of retrench
mtnt during the last year of their administration But he feared
if they had even then been indulged with another yeai s gtace
they would have fulfilled the old adage—
"The devil v>a-> sick—the devil a saint would be,
"The devil got well—the devil a saint was he "
Mr P next took a general view of the policyof the late Ad
ministration towauls the clu^e of Us tei m, in the courbe of which
he alverted to the aggregate expenditures of the four year*,
with a view of sustaining the allegation that the average of ex
pendumes was thirty tire millions    He admitted, that in this
theexttaordinary expenditures were included, but, he asked,
what were ihibe extiaordmary expenditures'!   It had been con
tended, on the other side  that they weiemade up of Treasuiy
notes redeemed debt paid, trust fund* internal improvements
Ac (enumerated,) bu* were not the Treasury notes paid and
the debt discharged, obligations contracted by the gentlemen
themselves' and had they"Yiot a right to pay them and charge
the pay men' is part of then expenditures, and as to theother
items,   won! I   they not be chargeible  to  the   present Ad
mimstriion   too?    The  excuses  made  about  extraordinaiy
expenditures, he considered veiy similar to thOf>e which might
be offered by i profligate rake whose father {had given him ¿n
allowance oftxshteen 01 twenty hundred dollars a ye trior his
expense= but Alio spenf thirty live hun I red iolíars i year, and
when called to account by his pue t shoulj attempt to justify
himself by insisting that he only epeiv his annual income, he
cause bis hoar 1 and clothing, and ordinary expenses were the
same—the excess bung in extraordinaiy expenses,   suchas
champagne at Ponhnger & and fashionable vices elsewheie
HeieMi P to k ano her leview of the same penod on the
admission that iff expenditures! for ordinary pwpo-.es were
twenty eight miliiot s annuiliy, an 1 aftei commenting for sor"1
time thai eon he conflated the expenditures and retrenchments
of the last jear of the term, wi h the ex¡ endituies and retrench
mentsof the rtr^tiyeai of the pies-entAdm nistra ion and conten '
ed that the economy offline now in power would come out m
umphant from the companion He asked from the gentlemen
hut a httie time—they had ¡i ft then ^uccepsors an un weeded
gtrden~-thing3 iañk and trro^s in uifure possessed it meuly
]*t the Whigs get into it fan !y with then hoes, and they woull
m due time show a  ew system of culture, by which the desett
would be made to blosson like the rose
If the Whigs are driven into extraordinary and extravagant
expenditures, he trusted they wouldnotsurrender up their U ust,
without leaving some monument behind them of their pa-
triotism at least                                     „                ,     ,   „
He trusted they would leave a well appointed and efficient
navy—a sufficient re venue—a well furnished house and a thriv-
ing condition of the country
It was obvious that a loan must be had, and to obtain it the
bill must be efficient in authority under any circumstance The
giound assumed by the mover of the amendment now pending,
and by those who advocated its adoption, is, that a pledge is re
ce^sary— that a mortgage must be off-red Am rtgageisno
better than a promiae-unless theie isacourtoi justice toen-
force it He would a&k what is the ground upon which
Governments mvaiiably stek for accommodation"* I¡>
it not national ho or, and theie can be no other
pledge, for if that is not kept no other can be
depended upon The public laith is given, and the sagaci
tyof mankind will see that it is the Only national pledge
that can be depended upon Every citizen's propeity is pledged
in the geneial pledge of the faith of the Government IIe,con
tended that the ofld of this pledge of the public 1 «ids would
have a tendency to discre nt the Government Where is the
excise power? If the nectssity is to exist of resorting to it, let
it come It will do the country good to levy an excise on it of
five millions It will be salutary It will force public atten
tion to the expenditures of this Government
He held in his hand an estimate of the consumable articles
ofjthe last beven years i up >r(ed,the av erage of w Inch was ninety
one millions He took this average for the next <*even years,
and made calculations at twenty five pei cent duty to show
that with the restoration of the land fund anJtheieduuion of
the free fist—taxing tea and coffee, &c —a suffic ent revei ue
could be obtained not only to suppoitdie Government but to
provide for the liquidation of the debt
This could be accomplished, but gentlemen must consent to
tax tea and coffee and other articles lofigfavoied on the'iee i lot
They must also come up to 'he tnaik at once, and restore the
land fund It was a fund that nevei should have been taken
from the revenue—they had now seen the madness and the
folly of giving it away—it was a dangerous, he feared a fatal
step, and there was not to be a moment lost m retiacmg it
i here could be no excuse for longer withholding it from the
lreasury Every one admitted the limit of the compromise
act mu&t be transcended, and thereiore the contingency exists
on winch the law itself surrenders it But let that surrender
be a separate measure, and unconnected with anyp edge He
would go for the full tepeal of the distribution He believed
the land fund never should be-taken from the revenue Ihe
repeal will come, in spite of every effort to prevent u Thetoun
tiy will rise in one mass against the act of distribution, under
existing circumstances. It is not in the power of man to save
the land bill If persisted m, it will piostr<tte the Whig party
Why shoald the Whig paity let itself be probated by it? It is
nota Whig measure—it never wa«: a Whig measure—he could
proven fiom Mr Clay's own speech at Taylorsville
He w uld not, however, go into these things now It was
enough to remind his friends that t ley nevei could have pa&^ed
the land bill at tne extra sebs>on but ¡or the proviso of restoring
the fund should the compromise act b1* violated All the ai
ment& about its being an indispon abte paitofthe great system of
Wh gmeasuies could not have earned it through without tins
express condi ion The que-t on had been asa.ee!, what harm
had occurred from if* Every thing occurred from i> II it had
been foreseen at the exti ise&sion that the Government would
be n such aeon Jition as it now is in, with its credit prosttate
and its obligations pioteste 3, not even the proposition of that
land bill could have been brought /orward He was glad to
see the stand taken by the&enatoi from Virginia [Mr Archer]
in favoi of the good old doc rineof the light of the Government
to the piopeity m ti e public domain, anditsentne control ovei
the whole subject
But this proposition to pledge the pub'ic domain wis a sepa
lafei&sue fiom that of restoring the land fund Heiegarded the
amendment of the Senator from Mississippi™ that particular,
as a proposition to stop the supplies of Government He aid
notattnbute that intention to the Senator, nor to the Senator
from Virginia who had seconded the amendment
Mr WALKDR inquired ifthe President of the United States,
in his message to Congress, proposed to stop the supplies of
Government?
Mr PRL  TON did not a'tubute motives to gentlemen—he
had expre-siy stited that—but the Piesident of tne J¡ «ed
States was acting under diffcient circumstances from
trnse controlling Congreso Tie had acted properly, and was
right m recommending what he thought propei, but the
proposition wa re ec ed with a whir wind m ti at b.anch of
Congress to wh ch the nes age had been sent To pa s it now
heie would be the metns oí causing tne n j^c ion oi ti^ wh de
bill m the o her Hou^t, or it would be tne c iu«e of interminable
negotiation Let the ¡ loposition to íestore the land lund come
as anothei and separate measure, let it corre m any other shape
and he would \ ote forif
With regard to the difficulty raided about the authority to sell
the stock atiesa than \ ar, he would say, the money must be
had, and how is it to be had—how, hut by buying it? As much
mustbepaidfontasitis woith—justlikepro isions or clothing
for the sol 1 eryofth'1 Government Itmusibehad and when the
necessity is inevitable, it mu«t be bought at whatever price it
commands m the market Pe believed it could be had foi 95,
but if 7, 8, or 10 pei cent discount must be ¡mi i to get money',
let it be paid He was unwilling to give a disciPtionaiy power
to any individual bu. he would yield to nnrenous necessity
and would therefore confí le to the Secretary of the Treasury
thed ocreinnary power of going into the money market, here
oi abroad, to obtain this money, and for the faithful discharge
of his triito', tha' officer and the whole Government would he le

Mr P after d vel'mg at some length on the causes which
conmbutedto leave the debt of five and a half millions of the
last <\dmif istiatio i to be paid by the piesent charged that t! e
lipds which had been a lvertised were withh Id from sale, after
hem? so advertised, and argued that if the "W hie: administra
tionsnee it camemo powet,did withhold lands fiom «die.
it merely followed the precedentset it He concluded by ur<*
ing the propriety of the pasase of the bill, aid of throwing the
stock into the market to sell for whatever it would bring to
maintain the ronor an 1   reditof the Government
Mr EVANS now desied that the Seriate would vote on
the amendments, and oider the bill to be en^io sed
for a third reading on Monday lhat he believed was
the understanding on yesterday He desired himself to make
some remarks in reply to what had fallen from several Senators
against the bi 1, but he would forego a reply, such was the ur-
gency for action on the bill Those Senator  who still wished
to address the Senate could do so on Monday
Mr YOUNG hoped this couise would not be adpted He did
notseethepiessmg urgency for such a course—there being
Treasury note*? on hand to meet the Immediate and pressing
wants ol the Government He desired only five minutes to
make a few remarks
Mr SEVIER was anxious to vote on this amendment—but
he had pan r-d t ff for to day and-as the probability was that no
vote could be taken to day, he would move an adjournment
Mr BAYARD saidit was necessary lor him to be absent on
Monday, and was anxious to it cord his vo e on the amendment,
as he had not paired off if the quesioi was not taken this
evening, he would lose his vote
Mi MANGUM wasopposedtohurryiugthebid through thia
evening Many propositions had been annout ced m debate
which ought not to be passed over without reply, and he, for
one, could not consent to forego a reply
Mr SCVIER, at the suggestion of several, withdrew the mo-
tion for an adjournment when
Mr YOUNG said he hadas atement before him which show-
ed thatwhen Mr Van Bmen rutred from the Administration
of the Government, on the 31 of March, 1841, a debt was left
ouNUndmff, and unredeemed of Tieatuiy notes to the amount
ofS5 607 0GÜ There had been piovided for the incoming Ad-
minis ration, five mi lions of Tieasuiy'rotc, so that instead of
finding an empty Treasury, theie weie authorized to be issued
over and above the outstanding amount, a sum of five millions.

On July 2Ut 1811, durmgt! e memoiab'e ex ti a tension, another

another loan ot ^5 000 tOO \t d now in he month of April, 1842,
an additiora! loan of five millions; making in all the enormous
amount of $¿7,üü0 ÜÜ0 in thirteen months Is not this astound-
ing? But let us examine this matter furthei The loan pre-
posedbv his bul is «11331,000, including $6331000 of the
$12 000000 loan The interest on this sum at six percent.
amounts to $679 860 for each yeai making the enormous ag-
giegate amount of interest for the twenty years $13 597,200, ex-
ceedmgthe pnncipal debtby ©2,266,200, and putting the prin-
cipal and Interest together, and we shall ha\ e a debt, undei this
bill alone at the end of twenty years, of the enoimoussum of
$24 928,200 Thus loan follows loan in quiek succession, and
this hab tended as much as any thing else to weaken public con-
fidence in the public credi Ihe people see it in becoming
a Governtren ol 'oans And what new becomes of the doctrine
advanced by the resolution  debated here so long to the exclu-
sion of the business of the «ession—that we should raise the
means within trie year to meet the e\pense£- of the year Why
not pioude the means from the resonres ot the country? Sir,
we have heard of a compromise act, by wbi h tne duties upon
