GOLDSBOROUGH, December 26, 1864.

Major PARKER, Assistant Adjutant-General:

I see by General Leventhorpe's dispatches of yesterday and to-day that the two regiments ordered from him are much needed. The enemy, having re-enforced at Plymouth, are now at Jamesville, twenty-three miles from Fort Branch. Great danger must result from the withdrawal of these troops. If these men are withdrawn no re-enforcements can be sent forward in time to meet the enemy. Every man except provost guard has gone from here. No troops are at Weldon. It is surely not good policy to sacrifice the only strong point we now have on the Roanoke, and with it the forage and subsistence of a fertile region. I respectfully ask that General Leventhorpe be permitted to return the troops he now has.

L. S. BAKER,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

SUGAR LOAF, December 26, 1864 - 6.30 p. m.

Brigadier General L. S. BAKER, Goldsborough, N. C.:

Let General Leventhorpe return with his two regiments to the Roanoke and meet the enemy.

BRAXTON BRAGG.
