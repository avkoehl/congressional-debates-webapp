it would  be  our  reliance—our  security      Our

would render the country, from Miino to F'orida,
I would rr nder our frontiers, from the lakes to
the ocean, impugnable to any foreign enrmy
And now, Mr  President, is the fit, the acceptf d
time to carry on these great works for national
security and defense     We are supplied with an
abundance of available  means;  we have given
encourajement to one of the great interests of
our country that we will not disturb a measure
appertaining  to that  interest for half  a dozen
years yet to come    We are every day and every
hour adding to our resources     There cannot,
then, be a more opportune period for compb ting
the great works for national defense and for na-

mor   strongly tlv  bond of national union, would

Mi President, wt hive nothing to fear from
external oi from internal enemies, from foreign
collisions, or from domestic cxi itement, if we, the
representatives of the States and of the people, aie
faithful to the country, faithful t> ourselves, faith-
ful to the Constitution The fidi hty of the Noith
W>11 never tirt , th patriotism of the South will
never keep back. They will go together, they
will on all occisions prt sent an unbroken force in
resis*mg every eni my, and in putting down every
excitement Our southern friends maybe assured
that there is no disposition existing in the free
States to break in upon the compromise of the
constitutional compact to invade their rights of
property That slavery is regarded as a great
evil by the philanthropist in every section, cannot
be doubted, but that the good mui of the North,
that nineteen twentieths of her moral and of her
physical power will, on all occasions, and at all
times, be put in requisition, to defeat the madand
visionary schemes of fanaticism, is alike free from
doubt
Let us, then, with a common feeling of patriot-
ism, unite in the prosecution of this work of na-
tional defense Let us lay aside party considera-
tions, and go forth in our might to do our whole
duty for our country. Let us rally around the
Government of our choice, and sustain and sup-
port our institutions by the exertion of every
moral and intellectual power
Let ua bear constantly in mind the injunction of
one of the great political Fathers of the Republic,
"That the preservation of the Federal Govern-
'ment in its wholp constitutional vigor, is the
' sheet-,) nchor of our peace at home and our safety
'abroad "
I                         NATIONAL DEFENSE
DEFERRED HOUSE DEBATE.
1                   Tuesday, January 26, 1836.
Mr. MASON, of Virginia, from the Commit-
tee on Foreign Affairs, reported the following
resolution •
" Retoh erf, Thit from ind after Tuesday, the 2d day of
Fíbnnry, the several bills miking appropriations for the
support ol tK>vemment, tlie naval and military service, fot-
tiiic mons, and the Indiin department, at the hour of one
o'clock eic'i dij, evci pt on Frulajs anil Saturdiye, shall
take precedence in the order of business, and shall be con-
sidered until the same shall have passed the House "
Mr HARDIN rose to a point of order. He
said it had been thr habit of standing committees
to report resolutions in violation of what he con-
ceived to be the spirit and intention of the rUles.
The present proposition could, with as much pro-
j pnety, have been submitted by the Committee
of Claims, upon which his honorable friend from
Ohio [Mr Whittt eset] presidí d with «o much
ability and i nown, and with equ il propriety
could the Comnstfe fn the Distnctof Columbia
icpoit i bill settling the boundary bttwei n Ohio
and Michigan The Committee on Foreign Af-
fan s h id undertakt n to regulite the business of the
House, and he hoped tin question would be de-
cided, w liether this innovation upon the rules and
usagt s of the body was to be tolerated. He had
been looking for such a resolution for a week
past, and he was not surprised when it was pre-
sented
' Mr M \SON said that the resolution reported
from the Committee on Foreign Affairs did pro-
pose to changi , m some respects, the order of
business in the House He should have pre-
ftrnd that it should be decided without debate
It v is in lmpoitant proposition, and its purpose
and object was to put it in the power of the
Housi to act promptly upon the bills providing
supplies fot the support of Government, and for
th military ind n ivil service While he did
not desire to avoid debate, it must be obvious
thit on this proposition beneficial discussion
could litrdly be inticipated
Hi did not understand the precise form of ob-
ject on which thegi ntlemanfrom Kentucky mide
to the r solution Does he intend to dispute the
authority of the Committee on Foreign Affairs to
repo t such a proposition' Mr M would re-
mind tin House, that the President of the United
S'ltes, in his message of the 18th of January, had
used the following language:
* The return of our Charge d'AiFaires is attended with
p ib'ic notices of nival pn parations on the part of France,
destined for our «ea^ Of the cause and intent of these
imminent  I hav e no autht ntic information, nor any other
meins oi judemg except such as are common to yourselves
and to the public , but, wlntever mav be their objt ct, we
are not it libertj to rt irard them a  unconnected with the
measures which hostile movements on the part of France
may compel us to pursue They at least deserve to be met
by adequate pn paration on our part I therefore ttrongly
ur%e large antl speedy appropriation* for the increase of our
Na\} and completion of our coast defenses "
This message was referred by the House to
the Committt e on Foreign Affairs. Its recom-
mendation, thus referred for examination, ren-
I dered it the imperious duty of the committee to
report the resolution that the House should, day
after day, consider the bills of appropriation, or-
I dinary and extraordinary, and make the provision
for public defense called for by the exigencies of
I the country     The committee, acting under the
| most solemn sanction y had executed the instruc-
tions of the House, and he could not believe that
the ob)ection taken would be sustained. The
usage of the House justified the resolution, and,
if ever there was a time when -such a standing
order was required by the public interests, Mr M
thought all would agree that it was called for now.
Mr. HARDIN reduced his point of order to
writing, which was, in substance, that the reso-
lution was mot within the line of duty or juris-
diction of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, but
belonged to the Select Committee on the Rules.
The CHAIR decided the resolution to be in
order, but that it must receive the vote of two
thirds to pass it, inasmuch as it proposed to give
precedence to certain bttéiness.
Mr BELL said that the Chair having decided
that it was for the House to determine whether
the resolution wrts in order or not, he supposed
no member would appeal firosa the decision, and
he would therefore proceed to dlseuss the expe-
diency of adopting it. As to th* question of or-
der (said Mr. B„) it is clear that the Committee
on Foreign Relations has no more right to report
or offer such a resolution at this time than any
individual member of the House, or any other
..standing, or any select committee of the Hou«6.
■"if any committee had sueh a right under the rules
and pfactice of the House, it would be the Com-
mittee of Ways and Means. Such an order as
that embraced in the present resolution had been
resorted to heretofore, in relation to particular and
separate bills oft subjects before the House, but
it had always, so far as his knowledge extended,
, been done under such circumstances, as to com-
mand the general assent of the House, and then
it might be more properly said to be conceded
I from eourtesy and a general sense of the propriety
