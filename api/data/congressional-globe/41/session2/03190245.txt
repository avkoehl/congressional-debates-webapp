hundred, thousand, by the invitation of our
Government, and occupying these lands, in-
creasing this deprecated competition, and add-
ing thereby to the prosperity of the country.
Agriculture should be encouraged rather than
unjustly taxed and oppressed.
It is a crime against humanity to attempt
by legislative coercion to withdraw our people
from the farm to other pursuits. If any interest
should b e fostered it is the agricultural interest.
Here are the fountain of our prosperity and
greatness as -a nation, the home and nursery
of all manly virtues, and the best school of a
genuine patriotism. The farmer asks neither
bounties nor special privileges from his Gov-
ernment ; but he has a right to demand equal
and just laws, and protection from the insid-
ious schemes of those who, under cover of
plausible catch-words, would rob and impov-
erish him.
As Mr. Webster is a great favorite with the
protectionists I will commend to their consider-
ation another passage from that great orator :
"Agriculture, unfettered in our country, is highly
favorable to human happiness. It offers such assur-
ances of permanent property and respectability to
the industrious, it makes such a nation of freehold-
ers, that it need not envy the happiest and most
prosperous of the manufacturing communities, jve
may talk as wo will of well-fed andwell-clothod day
laborers or journeymen; they aro not after all to be
compared cither for happiness or respectability with
him who sleeps under his own roof and cultivates his
own fee-simple inheritance."
Mi'. Chairman, I am under great obligations
to the committee for the unusual indulgence
extended to me. The great interest I feel in
this question must be my apology for v/hat I
fear will be regarded as an abuse of this kind-
ness. I have purposely avoided all party allu-
sions for the reason that I wish to see this
question rise above party. The cause for
which I plead here to-day is the cause of civ-
ilization, of humanity, and of progress. _ In
the name of justice I demand the emancipa-
tion of labor from unnecessary and unjust tax-
ation ; that monopoly shall cease ; that capital
shall loosen its grasp upon the throats of the
people; that Government shall no longer be
used as a mere instrument to rob and impov-
erish the humble and the lowly; that the bar-
barous system of legislation for the benefit of
classes and sections shall be abandoned. I
demand equal and just laws; that the neces-
sary revenues may be raised without oppres-
sion to any class or section, and with the least
possible impediment to the progress of national
industry and prosperity.
Mr. Chairman, thankingthe committee again
for its kindness, I will now concludc my re-
marks, already too protracted, by repeating and
adopting the beautiful language of M. llouher
in a debate in the French Senate in January
last:
111 declare upon my soul and conscience, and after
long study, my belief that free trade is the law ot
the future and the condition of high civilization.
You that hear mo will eventually arrive at that
conviction, whatever may be your present state ol
incertitude. On commercial liberty depends that
precious benefit, the peaco of the world, and con-
sequently the maintenance of those cosmopolitan
relations which procure the riches of nations.
National Debt, Ac.
SPEECH OF HOlTV. LAWRENCE,
01? ohio,
In tiie House of Representatives,
April 1, 1870.
The Houso having met as in tho Committee of the
Whole on the state of the Union on the President's
annual message-
Mr. LAWRENCE said:
Mr. Speaker,: The national debt, the public
expenditures, taxation, and the currency, are
now the engros sing topics of political inquiry,
How to dispose of the national debt; how
and where to reduce expenditures; on what,
how, and at what rates to impose taxes, the
character and amount of our national currency,
and when and how to be redeemed in coin—
these are the questions which in our Republic
require investigation and determination.
the debt and currency—oue policy.
I proposS to consider some questions relat-
ing to the national debt—how taxation may
be reduced, and then the currency.
In doing this I will discuss a bill which I in-
troduced in this House on the 14th of February,
(H. E. No. 1212)—
To provide for funding tho public debt at a lower
rate of interest, to seoure uniformity in tho value of
the national currency, and to determine tho tiino and
mode of resuming spccio paymonts.
what tiii5 debt is.
The national debt on the 1st of March was:
Five-twenty G per cent, gold-interest bonds, redeem-
able 5 years from dates in 1862 to 1868, and payable
in 20 years $1,002,072,750
Ten-forty 5 per cent, gold bonds, re-
deemable in 1874, payablo in 190-1  191,507,300
Bonds payablo 1881 and othors  ^10,09X600
Three per cent, certificates, $15,535,000,
and Navy pension fund, $14,000,000,... 50,555,000
Matured debt  ".,973,340
Currency:
United States notes, (green-
backs) $350,000,000
Fractional currency   39,950,030
Demand notes  110,000
  396,030,039
Total $2,567,528,035
But after deducting bonds, $99,323,000, cur-
rency, and coin in the Treasury, the debt is only
$2,438,328,477.
me debt—where held.
These bonds are held about as follows:
By national banks:
To socure circulation  $330,680,100
To secure deposits by tho Government.. 18,704,300
In banks  22,250,607
380,435,097
By insuranco companies $150,000,000
By savings-banks  225,000,000
———. 375,000,000
By citizens of United States  452,501,103
In Europe  800,000,000
Total $1,997,939,200
The Secretary of the Treasury, in his annual
report, says:
"The bonds known as ten-forty bonds, amounting
to $191,567,300, are not payablo until 1874. The six per
cent, bonds, payable in 1881, amount to $283,677,000.
As tho bonds known as eighty-ones and tcn-lorties,
amounting in the aggregate to $478,211,900, are not
payable and cannot be paid previous to 1874 and 1881,
it is unnecessary to consider them in making provis-
ion for a new loan. Tholive-twenly bonds, amount-
ing in tho aggregate to $1,602,671,100, aro either pay-
able or will soon bocomo payable, and it is to this
class of the public debt, and lo this class alone, that
attention should bo directed."
But of the five-twenty bonds the Government
holds $27,870,520 belonging to the sinking
fund, and $72,782,708 purchased by the Gov-
ernment, leaving only $1,502,011,808.
what will 11e saved by fukding.
That it is desirable to convert the "five-
twenty" bonds into bonds bearing a less rate
of interest needs no argument to prove. The
annual interest now, at 6 percent., on $1,500, -
000,000 of five-twenties is in gold coin $90,-
000,000, equal in currency to over $108,000,000.
If funded, as the bill proposes, into three classes
of bonds, redeemable respectively in twenty,
thirty, and forty years, the first class at 4J per
cent, annual interest, and the residue at not
exceeding 4 per cent., the annual saving to
tho Government or. $1,400,000,000 woald bo
$25,G66,6&5 in coin, equal to about$80,000,000
currency.
If it shall be thought expedient to fund the
debt in three classes of bonds, redeem aMe in
15, 20, and 25 years, and payable 5 years later
in each class, as the Secretary of the Treasury
proposes, I shall offer no objection to that.
But a longer loan will secure a lower rate of
interest.
it is practicable to i<'un'd.
Is it practicable to effect this change? The
Secretary of the Treasury, who has investigated
this subject, says:
" Questions that have been raisod in regard to tho
nature of the obligation assumedby tho Government
in tho issue of these bonds havo undoubtedly de-
terred many persons from purchasing them as a
permanent investment, and consequently, they are
largely hold in this country and in liurope for specu-
lative purposes, by persons who design to put them
upon tho market whenever the advance shall fur-
nish a sufficient inducement, or when political or
financial disturbances may creato a demand for
money for otherpurposes."
disputed questions—payment ix or ees? backs—
taxation.
These disputed questions are, whether the
five-twenties are taxable and whether they are
payablo in gold or "greenbacks."
On the 22d June, 1804, when Congress was
considering one of tho bills to authorize an ad-
ditional five-twenty loan, Mr. Brooks, of New
York, moved to amend byinserting the words
" payable in coin."
Mr. Hooper, of Massachusetts, said it was
unnecessary, and a letter was read from S. P.
Chase, then Secretary of the Treasury, in which
he said:
"These bonds*, according to tho usage of the Gov-
ernment, aro payablo in coin."
A nd thereupon tho motion of Mr. Brooks was
withdrawn. Every Secretary of the Treasury
since has declared the same thing.
But the obligation to pay in coin has been
denied in Congress and out of it, in grave offi-
cial State papers, in newspapers, by State con-
ventions, and on the stump. The first act of .
Congress approved by President Grant on the
18th of March, 1809, to strengthen the public
credit by reaffirming the opinions expressed by
Secretary Chase, is liable to repeal, and is by
no means final. It was well understood in
Congress that this measure was designed to be
followed by others to relieve the people of some
of the burdens of the national debt, and this
was urged as a reason for its passage. The
question whether these bonds may properly be
taxed under national authority has given rise
to equal controversy. The result has been as
stated by the Secretary of the Treasury, that
the bonds are not generally held forpermanent
investment.
Now, the bill I am considering proposes to
settle these questions by funding the old bonds
into new ones to be issued, payable in gold
and exempt from all taxes under State or
national authority.
The Supreme Court has decided that with-
out this no State could tax national bonds.
(4 Wheaton, 310; 9 Id., 738; 12 Id., 419; 2
Peters, 449; 16 Peters, 435; 2 Black, 020; 3
Wallace, 585.) And as to national taxation,
the bill follows the recommendation of Alex-
ander Hamilton, who, in his second and last
annual report on public credit, on the 10th of
January, 1795, recommended to Congress—
"That thore bo an express renunciation by law ol
all pretension of right to tax the public funds."
(Elliott's Rep.; House Doc. No. 15,1st sess. 28 Cong.,
390: 5 American State Papers, vol.1 of Finance,
338.)
Sufficient reasons^exist for this. If an un-
limited right of taxation is reserved purchasers
cannot be found for the bonds : or if so, they
will only take them at a price reduced more
than Fntficient to indemnify them against any
