Making public officers depositories—Mr. Legare.

H. of Reps,
whose banking companies, whether with or without
charter, subjected to no restraints or control, but
such as spring out of the vigilance of a free and
eager competition, have for upwards of a century
together conducted their affairs with so much skill,
integrity, and prudence, as net only never to have
occasioned any loss either to the public or the par-
ties interested, but, on the contrary, by the confes-
sion of all competent judges, to have conferred the
greatest blessings upon both—to have contnbuted
more than anv •single cause, perhaps, than all other
causes put together, to bring outjand develop com-
pletely all the resources of the land, to foster in-
dustry, to animate enterprise, and by an abundant
supply of the means, of exchange, to turn its capi-
tal and labor to the greatest possible account—
where, m addition to these economical advantages,
they have contrived to exercise a high moral con-
trol, a sort of censorial authority, over the commu-
nity, and especially the humbler classes of it, by
bestowing rewards m the shape of credit upon in-
dustry and economy, and lending upon good person-
al character, as if it were solid capital, and through
a system of cash accounts and inteiest upon small
deposites, have given to the deserving laboier the
combined advantages of a savings bank and a
friendly endorser—a country which has made
greater progress within the period mentioned, than
any other in Europe, with an agncultuie second
(if second) only to that oí Flanders, with a flourish-
ing commerce, w ith manufactures of the greatest
extent and the most exquisite refinement—whose
cities have almost kept pace with ours, -whose
whole face in its gladness and beauty beais testi-
mony to the spirit of improvement diat has animat-
elher—whatcountry is thai1 Scotland, sir Every
body has heard, or ought to have neaid, of the
Sco'eh system of banking , ard I ask it anv thing
can be more irreconcilable with thetheones so ecn-
fidently advanced hen., than facts (oiinected with
its history' I know, sir, what may be said m re-
ply to this otherwise triumphant example I am
aware that the Scotch banks have, m times of pres-
sure, been compelled to lean upon the Bank of
England—that objection  have been made by high
authorities, to the principles on which they have
been conducted, and that other persons, admitting
their unquestionable usefulness and success, have
ascribed it to circumstances which render the s>s-
tem an unfit model for imitation elsewhere. Be it
so But still it is banking—bankinsr on the English
plan, with a veiy inadequate supply, scarcely any
supply of bullion, bankinc wi hout limitation or
control, without any íefeten e or lespoisibihty to
Government—banking, in a word, with all the de-
fects imputed to that system, m their most exagge-
ratsd forms
But if this example be not satisfactory, let us
look at the experience of the two other countnes in
which the sjstem exists, and exists, as we are told,
in its most vicious state—England and the XJn ted
States Look at the results I have no f<oth at
all in speculative pohtrcs A theorist in g >vcrn-
ment is as dano",ous as a theorist m medicine, or
m agncultuie, and for precisel} the same reason—
the subjects are too complicated and too obscure
for simple and decisive expenm-nts I go foi un-
disputed results in the long run Now surety a
philosophical mcuirei into the history of th' com-
merce and pub o ec nomy of nations, if he saw a
people pre-tnunently distinguished in those particu-
lars above all others, would be mcHned to asenbe
their superiority to what v,as peculiar n men insti-
tutions , at least whatever might be his ideas a
priori on such subjects, he vou'd be ve y slow to
deny to any remarkable peculiarity in these insti-
tutions its lull lmpo.tance as one of the piobable
causes of the success which he wi nessed, unless
he could clearly show the contiaiy Then, sir, b}
what example are we to be guided in such matters
if not by that of England—b> far the m jst magnifi-
cent manifestation that the w orld n anv age of it,
has ever beheld, of the might and the grandeur
of civilized life Sir, I hav e weighed ev erv sv Uab'e
that I utter—I express a deliberate conviction,
founded upon a patient inquiry and a comparison,
as complete as my limited knowledge has enabled
me to make it, between ti e past and present con-
dition of mankind, and oetween the great nation of
16
which I am speaking and those which smround her
Sir, there is a gulf between them—that nanow
channel separates w orlds—it is an ocean more than
three thousand miles wide I appeal to any one
who has been abroad, whether going from England
to any part ot the continent, be not descending im-
mensely m the scale of civilization I know, sir,
that that word is an ambiguous one I know that
m some of the graces of polished society, in «ome
of the arb of an elegant imaginafi«n, that in the
exact sciences and in mere learning and general
intellectual cultivation, some nations have excelled,
perhaps manv equalled England But in that
civilization vv hich, as I have said before, it is the
gte°t end of modern political economy to promote,
and which is immediately connected vith the sub-
ject before ycu , which at once springs out of, and
leads to, the accumulation of capita!, an 1 the disti i-
bution of wealth and comfort through all clashes of
a community with an immense aggregate of nation-
al powei and resources—that civili7alion which en-
ables man to ' wie'd these elements and arm him
with the foue of all their legions," vvh ch gives him
dominion over all other ceatures,and males him
emphaticalty the Lord of the Universe—that civ ili-
zation which consists not in music, not 1.1 plavan 
on the flute as the Athenian hero said, but in turn
mg a smail city into a great one, in that v icton ms,
triumphant, tries s'ible civilization, there ísnotMiy

hci e, and elected to possess and people a continent,
which lelong to few other objects, either of the
moral or material world We may become so
much accustomed to such things that the) make as
little impression upon om minds as the glories of
the Heavens above us , but looking on them, late-
ly, as with the eje o( the stranger, I felt what a
recent Ensli^-h traveller is said to have remarked,
that far from being vvnhout poetry, a« some have
vainly a bged, our whole country is one great
poem Sir, u is so, and if there be a man that
can think ot what is doing in all parts of this most
blessed ol all landv, to embellish and advance it,
who can contemplate that living mass of intelli-
gence, actp íty and improvement as it rolls on m its
sure and s'eadj progress, to the uttermost extremi-
ties of the west, who can see scenes of savage de-
solation transformed, almost with the suddenneca
of enc hantrneflt, into those oí fruufulness and beau-
ty , crowned with flomshws cities, filled with the
noblest of all populations, n there be a man, I say,
that ca>i v itne^s all this passing under his very
ejes, without Ice'mg his heaitbeat high, and his
imagination warmed and transported In it, be sure,

ing, lor a moment, the infinite superiority of our
race m every thing that reletes to a refined and
w 11 oi deed puMic economj, and m all the means
and irstrumenis of a high socipl improvement, it
strikes me as. of all paiadoxcs the most singular, to
