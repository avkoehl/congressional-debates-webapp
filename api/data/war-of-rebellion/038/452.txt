Black River. Whether he will attack or not, I look upon now as doubtful. No doubt he would, however, if I should weaken my force to any extent. I have sent into Louisiana to learn the movements of Kirby Smith, but as yet hear nothing definite.

Should it be my fortune, general, to get into Vicksburg whilst you are still investing Port Hudson, I will commence immediately shipping troops to you, and will send such number as you may indicate as being necessary.

The troops of this command are in excellent health and spirits. There is not the slightest indication of despondency either among officers or men.

Hoping to hear favorable news from your field operations by the return of Colonel Smith, I remain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

U. S. GRANT.

HERRON'S HEADQUARTERS, June 30, 1863.

Major-General GRANT:

Deserters in to-day report provisions exceedingly scarce and a bad feeling among the troops. Mules were killed this morning and the meat distributed to the troops. They confirm the report of General Martin [E.] Green's death. He commanded the SECOND Brigade of Bowen's DIVISION.

F. J. HERRON.
