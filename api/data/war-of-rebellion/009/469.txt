HDQRS. FIRST DIVISION, DEPARTMENT OF NORFOLK, Suffolk, May 1, 1862.

Colonel S. S. ANDERSON,Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: As the enemy is threatening the coast throughout this division I respectfully request to know whether the troops stationed at Roanoke River and ordered to Goldsborough have been asked for again. That portion of the division is more exposed roads meet at Weldon, and nothing to prevent the enemy from coming up the river with their gunboats except an obstruction now in progress of construction below Hamilton.

There can be no doubt but that troops have left New Berne for Roanoke Island, and General Holmes can doubtless spare those sent him from this division.

I inclose to-day a dispatch from below, showing that the enemy are now near Edenton and Roanoke River.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. W. LORING,

Major-General, Commanding.

I have to-day sent Captain Poor, engineer, to the Roanoke, to select a place for a battery near Halifax.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. W. LORING,

Major-General, Commanding.

[Indorsement Numbers 1.]
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF NORFOLK, Norfolk, Va., May 2, 1862.

Respectfully forwarded. A similar application was sent from these headquarters on 14th April.

BENJ. HUGER,Major-General.

[Indorsement Numbers 2.]

RICHMOND, May 3, 1862.

Respectfully returned to General Cooper. The movement of General Johnston renders re-enforcements to General Huger necessary if they were available.

R. E. LEE.
