HDQRS. FIRST SUB-DIVISION FIRST MILITARY DIST.,Secessionville, May 25, 1863.

Captain W. F. NANCE, Assistant Adjutant-General:

CAPTAIN: I have had the enemy observed from a point supposed to be about 900 yards from the extremity of Big Folly Island, nearest Sout Folly, by a lieutenant of Twenty-fifth Regiment. He saw five earthworks, apparently redans. They extended from that end of Big Folly up the island for the distance of about a half mile. The work on their right flank and that on their left run out on the beach opposite James Island; the other works were more toward the interior of the island, within the wood. They may or may not be connected by aline of infantry entrenchments. He saw no guns. Lieutenant Samuel Dibble-the officer alluded to-is an officer of just intelligence and of good judgment. He thinks that these are the works of an entrenched camp, the tents of which he saw within the limits of these woods. The enemy shelled the pickets at Legare's for about a half hour to-day at 10-11 o'clock from a gunboat and battery in Folly River.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

CHARLES LH. SIMONTON,

Colonel, Commanding.
