Lieutenant-Colonel CLARK, Assistant Adjutant-General:

I have the honor to report that, in charge of scouts, I found the enemy's pickets on the WEST bank of Little River about noon. I crossed the river, and with Garrard's advance pursued the enemy about one mile, a short distance beyond the road leading to the iron-works. I learned from a citizen that Hood's wagon train crossed the Coosa at Edwards' Ferry, and that his army was moving in the direction of Gadsden, on the north side of the Coosa.
