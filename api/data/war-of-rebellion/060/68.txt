General PALMER;

Your dispatch received. Of course as soon as I am satisfied that i cannot manage them and drive them back I will fall back. Please have another section march up the Neuse road, to diverge toward Beech Grove by the Washington road. I think at daylight we will have some fun here. Have the railroad engine ready. My signals are befogged.

Colonel, Commanding Outposts.

General PALMER:

I am now trying to flank them; I think they have had about enough, still their lull may be deceptive. I would like four or five companies infantry march up the Neuse road, so that I can follow them up effectually. I have some few wounded.

Your last dispatch received. Thank you for the prompt aid. If I can't whip them back with that, I will fall back in order. I expect momentary report of a move which will decide my further action, of which you will be promptly advised.

General PALMER:

Pickett's whole division is in our front. Let some of the infantry come by train. Send train up at once, so that in case we have to retreat that some of our camp and garrison equipage can be saved.

Hoke's brigades is here from Lee's army.

General PALMER;

I have 2 prisoners, who report that Pickett's division is here with two brigades of Lee's army. They say that a general attack will be made. They mean to besiege New Berne. The first chance I have I will send these prisoners to you. Prepare for a severe attack.
