I would also suggest, in order to facilitate matters more, that the packcovers be painted a dark brown color. They would attract less attention and could be seen from a much less distance than the white.

DECEMBER 30, 1864.-Skirmish near Caruthersville, Mo.

Report of Colonel John B. Rogers, Second Missouri State Militia Cavalry.

CAPE GIRARDEAU, MO., December 31, 1864.

GENERAL: A party of guerrillas made their appearance some fifteen miles below Caruthersville. They were pursued by a detachment from that place, and 1, named Potter, was killed, 2 horses captured. More would have been killed, but the noise made by horses on frozen ground gave them notice, and they fled.
