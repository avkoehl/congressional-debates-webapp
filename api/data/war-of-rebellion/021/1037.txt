Major-General GARDNER,

Will not order General Buford's two regiments unless you feel safe to spare them. Have authority to order General Buford to join General Price, and will do so if he desires to go now.

Lieutenant-General, Commanding.

PORT HUDSON, April 6, 1863.

Lieutenant-General PEMBERTON:

I have ordered Buford on with his two regiments, as I feel satisfied I can spare them at this time. Buford wishes to take the field under your command.

HEADQUARTERS,

Port Hudson, La., April 7, 1863.

Lieutenant Col. J. R. WADDY:

COLONEL: The enemy have removed two divisions, with the siege artillery, from Baton Rouge, leaving there one division, with the cavalry and most of their field batteries. The troops withdrawn from this post can easily be spared at this time for more important services, but the garrison as it was at the time of the advance of the enemy was sufficient, and ought properly to be re-enforced again to the same strength in case this point should again be threatened with as strong a force.

I respectfully urge than the great necessity at this post is wagon
