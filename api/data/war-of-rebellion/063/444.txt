Colonel PHELPS,

Commanding South of White River, via Cassville:

I have been relying upon their arrival for three or four days. Sixty men of Captain Moore's company leave to-morrow for your headquarters with a train, and I have ordered Major Murhpy with his command out to Cassville at once. See that these troops are now sent out with the utmost promptness, and if the enemy at any time becomes too strong in your front fall back to Berryville or a position that you can hold, and communicate with me. Have Major Murphy out to Cassville in three or four days if possible. It is very important for the State and district that the force on the border be increased at once.
