reported them severally with an amendment
to each :
A bill (S. No. 44) to amend the judicial sys-
tem of the United-States ;
A bill (S. No. 75) regulating the rights of
property of married women in the District of

A bil} (S. No. 144) to enforce the fourteenth
article of amendment of the Constitution of
theUriited States; and
A bill (H. R. No. 3) to repeal an act regu-

" "He also, from the same committee, to whom
was referred the bill (S. No. 76) concerning
divorces in the'District of Columbia, reported

He also, from the same committee, to whom
was referred the joint resolatiou (S. B. No.
14) respecting the provisional governments of
Virginia and Texas, passed at the third session
of the Fortieth Congress,' reported it without
amendment.
Mr. TRUMBULL. The same committee,
to whom was referred the bill (S. No. 1) to
repeal an act regulating the tenure of certain
civil offices, have directed me to report it back
arid move its indefinite postponement. It is
covered by the bill from the House already
reported.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The last bill will
be indefinitely postponed unless objection be
made.
CAPITOL GROUNDS.
Mr. MORRILL. I am directed by the Com-
mittee on Public Buildings and Grounds to
report a jointresolution (-S. R. No. 21) author-
izing the removal of the public stables, steam
saw-mill, and other buildings from the Capitol
grounds ; and if there be no objection, as I
suppose there will be none, I ask that the reso-
lution be put upon its passage.
By unanimous consent, the joint resolution
was read three times, and passed. It author-
izes the officer in charge of the Capitol exten-
sion to clear from the Capitol grounds the
public stables, steam saw-mill, and such other
buildings as are of no further use to the work
on the Capitol extension.
RAILROAD GRANTS IN ALABAMA.
Mr. WARNER. The Committee on Public
Lands, to whom was referred the bill (S. No.
11) to renew certain grants of land to the State
of Alabama, direct me to report it back with-
out amendment and recommend its passage.
I ask unanimous consent of the Senate to con-
sider the bill at this time. It has twice re-
ceived the assent of the committee, it is very
important to our State, and>i think there will
be no objection to it.
_ By unanimous consent, the bill was con-
sidered as in Committee of the Whole. It
provides that the grant of lands made to the
State of Alabama by the act of Congress ap-
proved June 31, 1856, granting public lands
in alternate sections to the State of Alabama
to aid in the construction of certain railroads
in said State, to assist in the building of rail-
roads u from near Gadsden to some point on
the Alabama and Mississippi State line, in a
direction to the Mobile and Ohio railroad, with
a yiew to connect with the Mobile and Ohio
railroad," and "from Gadsden to conuect with
the Georgia and Tennessee andTehnessee line
of railroads through'Chattooga, Wills's, and
Lookout valleys,'1 shall be revived and re-
newed for the use and benefit of the Alabama
and Chattanooga Railroad Company, subject
to all the conditions and restrictions contained
in the act referred to, and subject to the further
limitation that if either of the railroads named
is not completed within three years from the
passage of the act no further' sale shall be
made for the benefit of such railroad, and the
lands uusoId shall revert to the United States.
The right, power, and authority is given to the I
cootfiatiteis building the railroads named to
take -from the public lands adjacent to their
lines earth, stone, and other materials for the
construction thereof, and the< right of way to
the extent of one hundred feet in width on
each side <jf the railroads where they may pass
over the public lands-, including all necessary
grounds for stations and structures connected
therewith, not exceeding forty acres at any
one station.
Mr. SPRAGUE. I do not know anything
about the merits of thia bill, but there is one
point that I wish to call the attention of the
Senate to, and that is that although no lands
may be granted to this railroad, and no lands
may be granted to the hundred other railroads
or proposed- railroads that may be presented
to the Senate or House of Representatives,
yet the indorsement of such projects is an in-
ducement to draw capital otherwise invested
into railroads through a portion of the country
where they are unnecessary, and it is one of
the curses of the present time that there is that
inducement given by legislation to withdraw
capital from the productive industries of the
country to the advancement of the interests
represented by railroads.
The bill was reported to the Senate without
amendment, ordered to be engrossed for a
third reading, read the tjiird time, and passed.
CONSULAR FEES.
Mr. NYE asked, and by unanimpus consent
obtained, leave to introduce a joint resolution
(S. R. No-. 22) relative to consular fees.
Mr. NYE. I should like, as a matter of jus-
tice, to have this resolution considered now.
Theproposition it contains was fully considered
and adopted by the Senate at the last session
on the recommendation of the Committee on
Commerce. By a law passed in July, 1866,
certain of our consuls abroad were made sal-
aried officers, and they were obliged to report
their fees to the Treasury Department. Many
of them had no notice of the law for months
afterward ; in fact, the circular notifying them
of it was not sent from the State Department
till the 22d of October, 1866. The simple ob-
ject of this resolution is to make that statute
take effect on the 1st day of January, 1867. I
hold in my hand a letter from the chief clerk
in the Fifth Auditor's office, showing that the
whole amount the Government will have to
refund under the resolution will be about ten
thousand dollars. Mr. Frelinghuysen intro-
duced this proposition at the last session, and
it was passed unanimously by the Senate and
agreed to by the committee of conference on
the bill to which it was attached, but after that,
as I am informed by one of the members of
that committee, a member of the House com-
mittee objected to it, and for the sake of har-
mony they consented to strike it out. It is a
measure of great justice which really ought
not to be delayed.
By unanimous consent, the joint resolution
was read three times, and passed. It provides
that section three of chapter two hundred and
thirty-three of the public acts of the Thirty-
Ninth Congress, approved July 25, 1866, shall
take effect from and after January 1, 1867, and
that> all fees which have been paid into the
Ireasury in obedience to the provisions of that
section and which accrued prior to the 1st day
of January, 1867, shall be refunded out of the
consular receipts.
