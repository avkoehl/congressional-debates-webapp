Making public officers depositories—Mr. Buchanan.
Senate 
the payment of this fourth instalment in specie
This view may, perhaps, be partially correct, and I
hope it is so Bat that would constitute, in my
mind, a stronger objection to this bill, for I should
see in lhat circumstance some prospect of relief to
the people I should perceive a source fiom which
that relief might flow, which this Government ap-
pears so unable or unwilling to afford Sir, it for
every dollar in speue these banks may discount to
the amount of ten dollars., as soon as it is ascertain
ed that this $12,944,666 is not to be withdrawn from
th"m, they ma} e vtend their discounts to an addi-
tion-1 extent oí #120,000,000 This sum, sir, dis-
tributed among the people m loans and discounts,
would diffuse a beam of joy and gladness over the
business community Yes, sn, with one-half of
this sum, thooe great public improvements, whose
progress has been so suddenly a nested, might be
recommenced and carried on to their completion
The shuttle and the loom would resume their wont-
ed motion The water vdieels of youi factories,
which are now rusting upon their axle«, would
again revolve under the propelling power of the
liquid element The dm of business vv ould again
be heard m the streets of your cities , indus'ry and
enterprise would at once spring into activity, and
the dark cloud of distress which now lowers over
our once happy country would be dispelled, and
the sun of prosperity again shed its cheering and
refreshing beams over our whole community But,
sir, in this day of our calamity, when the hopes of
a mighty nation are centred upon us, when oui de-
liberations are watched by many a tearful eye
and many a throbbing heart, what relief ¿oes
the Administration propose for this suffering
people1 It is a relief somewhat similar to that pro-
posed bv the tyrant Dionysius, when lie said "it
behooves us to take care of Jupitn," and then strip-
ped his statue of a robe of massy gold, and substi-
tuted a cloak of wool sajmg that "g 11 was too
cold m winter, and too heavy in sun.mei " Sj tins
Adm mstration proposes to relieve the dear people
by taking the golden robe of the currency into their
own possession, for their own use, and covering the
people with a tattered cloak of cotton oi wool lei
rags Or, sir, it is like the conduct of the captain
and officers of a ship, who, having by their ignor-
ance and mismanagement, run the vessel ashore,
take to the long-boat to save themselves, while they
leave the whole crew to the mercy of the waves
Sir, I have thus stated bneflj, some of the objec-
tions which compel me, and those associated v\ ith
me, in representing tht Stilt of New Jersev on th s
floor, to withhold our a'sent to tht, passage of th s
bill.    Before I take mv seat, perm t me to adiert
to some matters which have been introduced into
this debate, altogether foreign to ihe subject-matter
under discussion, but to which, since they have been
introduced, it may not be improper in me to reply
We have heard much, sir, in the course of this dis-
cussion, about democracy     It would appear as if
the majority of this hou*e thought the) were enti-
tled to be considered as the exclusive democial*,
and that the members who compose the minority
had  tvo pietensions to the name     Sir, this t rm
" democrat" has become very indefinite of late    I
should like to ksioa what is the couu definitu n of
the teim     Some of those gentlemen who visit Ihe
White House can no doubt give it to us    I sh iuld
like to hear it from them, that w e m íy have it ex
catkedia, and may know whit is necessary to con-
stitute a rerl Simon Pure    If we are to follow the
Executive standard, I should like to know which
set of the op mons of the present incumbent w e are
to adopt     Is it those hi. held w hen he was against
the   tariff,  or when  he   was   for it'   Thost he
held when he «as against internal improvements,
or for them''   Whei he was against the United
States Bank, oi when he was for if   When he
was against the New York Canal, or for if   When
he was against De Witt Clinton, or for him' When
he was against Mr  Adams or for him t   When
he was against General Jackson, or for him t   Sir,
if to be a democrat is to be constant!) chasing the
caprices of Executive opinion, then I am no demo-
crat , nay, sir, if to be a democrat it is necessary to
be continually trimming my sails to catch every
momentary bieezc of popular favor, then 1 am no
democrat    But if by a demowat is meant a man
who is m f-nor of protecting the rights and mtei-
ests of th  people—a man vv ho is m favor of re-
forming existing abuses, and "particularly those
abuses winch have brought the patronage of the
General Government into conflict with the freedom
of elections"—a man who is in favor of reducing
public expenditures, and therebv, as General Ja< k
son tells us, "counteracting that tendency to pub-
lic and pmate profligacy, which a profuse expen
diture of public money is too apt to engender"—a
man who is in favor of sustaining ihe just rights of
the representatives of the people against Executive
encroachment, ol upholding the just powers of all
the co-ordinate departments of this Government,
and of maintaining in all their cigmal strength and
purify those powers and privileges which ate guar
aalied to us 03 our glcrious Constitution, and trans-
nutting them unimpaired to those who aie to come
after him—then I av ei m} self to be a democrat it
is a faith in which I have always lived, ard in
which I hope to die
But, sir, we have always been told that the peo
pie of these United States have sanct oned all the
punciples of the last and present Evecutive To
this assertion I take the lioertv 10 dissent I deny
lhat all the monstrous principles of the la t ot pies-
ent Executive have been smctioned bj the people
oí the United States For the State of New Jti-
se\, I lake leave to say lhat many of those princi-
ples have been repudiated Yes, sir, in lhat same
gallant hule State, where, in the winter ol 1776,
the lmenoan eagle perched proudly v icti nous
ov er the prostrate Biilish lion , in the fall of 183b,
tne ea¿le of the Ameucan Constitution rose trium-
phant over the i oaring lion ol Executive encroach-
ment But ir, New Jersev is nut the on'y State
where these pi iiin pies have been reputhattd Look,
sir, -it the gallant State of ICentntk  she, too ho
rallied in delence i f the Constitution , hei repiescn-
tatives in this hail present a solid and unpe letrablc '
phalanx—an undivided "front they form " I eai -
not say, in Hie language of the poet, that they are a'l '
" still as ihe breeze," but I can say they will pi ove
themselves " dreadful as the stiiia, ' to the mm- I
ions of Executive power At, and look to the
State of Rhode Island, she, too, has iepudia* d those
principles And last, though rot least, look to the
State of Maine , with the vi-*oi of an infant Hercu-
les, she has burst the chains by which she was ¡
bound to the Executive cai , aul, even no v the
notes of the g' Jrious v ictorv, w a ted up m the vv m°s

But, sn, the Presilp^t has for our insliuction,

of com nending to his perusal the leplv which the
people of Maine have sent to this message I think
he may find a moral there whuh may be ol service

REMARKS OF MR.  BÜCHAIN4N
Of Pennsyia vma,
In Senate, October 3, 1837—On ihe bill imposing
additional duties, as depos tones in oeitam easts,
on public ofhceis— n íeply m Mi Websifr a
Massachusetts
Mi BUCHANAN said he h->d not flat end
himself tuat the rematks wh rh he had nn h so ii"
dav ago, in answer to theSeiator 10m Mass,
chusetts, vvouM have called him out m rep'v     It
has, sir, been alieady repo-ied over the whole
country, bv a portion of the newspaper press, that
the b ov s which I aimed at him with a feeble
hand, had been repelled by his adamantine armor,
vv ithout h avmg the slightest impre sion Besides,
(said Mi B ) I have since been utterly prostrated,
accor iing to tne same reports, by the Senator from
South Carolina, (Mr Preston,) and so belabored
aftei I u as down, that I can scarcely now be recog-
nised In my most intimate friends Under these
painful circunr-unces U affords me a ray of com-
mit to íin i lhat ihe Senator from Massachusetts
has dee i ed mv argument worthy of a studied
rep'v. 1 hope it nuj rot be considered presump-
tuous in m" to sa> a tew words by way of re-
joinder
Heaven forbid (said Mr B ) that I should be
foicel to he down in the same bed with the Sena-
tor from Massachusetts, the Senator from South
Carolina, (Mi Calhoun,) and the Secretary of the
Treasury Tor a man of peace hire myself, the
bed of Pioerustes would be mercy compared with
such a (el owship Neva were there more lll-
aS'Orle I ami heteiogeneous matenals brought toge-
ther Ii my aigument has made the three gentle-
men lie doy a ' >geih°i m the same bed, as the
Senator his asserted, there let them lie as best they
can I b g to be excused I rom becoming a pait-
ner vvjtn this triple alliance, conscious that in that
event n y fate would deserve to be pitied I shali
endeavor to sustain myself alont
I have noucon'ended that tae Government might
not, under the Constitution, draw in favor of public
credm is upon i $ own revenue in the hands of its
own depositones, and that these drafts might not
Circulate as currency between their date and the
time oí In ir presentation for pay ment Neither
have I contended that tie Government had no
power to burov m ncy, and issue Tieasmy niies
foi the am urt, in order to meet approbations
made b, Congiess Such diafts and such Treasury
notes, vi hilst liini ed in amount to the actual wants
of the Government, are necessary foi conducting
the business of the Tieasury Bid the Suialot
fiom Massachusetts understand me to have main-
tained that such an exeitise of powei would be a
viola'ion of the Constitution?
[Mr WetsTFR answered that he did not so un-
deistan 1 the gentleman It had been his purpose
to maintain that it was both the right and the duty
of the Gevcr ment to estabhsi a paper currency
as a n odium of con-r-e ce fu the country He
d d not confine lunis  f >o ih limits piescnbed by
Ihe gent'eman ]
The Senator and my elf (said Mr B ) under-
s'anl each other peif ctry What, thtn, is his
piopositionJ Tnat Congress possessing th  express
po ve - "to regulate commerce with fortian nations
and anion" tne several States, ' there results fr< m
tais power, by imp icat on, a powei to cíe-1 e a
papei currency of sufficient amount to furnish a
medium for our foreign and domestic exchanges
Now, s-ir, can such a vast power be derived, by
any fan construction, from this provision, of the
Constitution' That is the true question The
gentleman soars far above the d sputed povv er to
cieate a national bmk, and incidentally, through
its agenev, to iuimsh a paper currency for the
counuy He leaves this at an iinmeasuiable
distance behind, and contends that tne Government
possesses the general power to create such a cur-
rency ioi the people b, Us ( wn direct action, and
vv ihoiu ti e age icy of any ban1   vvhtievei
I did say, and I uov lepeat, that the sturdy
patr oís who lormel the Cois'tuition, and who con-
tened power upon th Government witn a jealous
hand, v ould have been greatly astonished had
thty b en infoimcd that sucn a power to create
a papei cunenov as that now contended for could
be foun I lurking in concealment under this grant
111e uü e commerce The Senator has again ap-
pealed to the authority of Mr \ladi,on, and, in
my oimion, again appealed to it in am He
must call some ether witness into court hpforp he
c-e establish his pos tion T^e ] omt to be main-
tained is that die Fathers oi the Constitulior, or
ani of them, had ev er held that a general power
to create ajiper cuirency v*as incidental to the
exercise of the pow er to regulate our commerce,
