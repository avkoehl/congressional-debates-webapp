Major-General STEEDMAN:

Just heard from my scouts in rebel camp on Holly Creek. Report that two of Wheeler's men returned from this place (Dalton this evening; they left Wheeler eleven days since at Gaddistown; were ordered to go to Dalton, Tunnel Hill, and Graysville, and report to Wheeler at Villanow. They reported correctly the force at this place. It appears Wheeler is moving northward. I send two scouts forthwith toward Villanow and two toward La Fayette.

DALTON, November 19, 1864.

Major-General STEEDMAN:

The rapid of rebels that have been committing outrages in the vicinity of Benton camped last night with those in Murray County, on the fork of Holly Creek, nine miles east of Spring Place. They numbered ninety-five; had considerable amount of plunder from citizens. I have [a] scout in their camp, who has just sent me word also that they and all other detachments are ordered to report at Athens, Ga. Three or four in Spring Place last night at this time. Probably sixty will comprise all north of Coosawattie. Some will disobey their orders and remain. I am anxious to hear from headquarters.

JAMES G. BROWN.
