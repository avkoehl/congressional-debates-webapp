to the division of their last dollar But it is pre-
cisely because I cannot see either its necessity* or
what it is to cost, or that it is proposed to give it
the most proper location, that I have risen to ask
for information from the chairman of the com-
mittee, and I now hope the chairman will put me
right before I proceed further in my remarks
Mr INGHAM (chairman of the Committee
on Naval Affairs) stated that there were reports
showing the necessity of another dry-dock, and
read from the last report of the Secietary of the
Navy in favor of one at NewYoik That the
one at Charlestown, that at Gosport, and the one
at Brooklyn, were all projected on the same plan,
and estimates made for them, by an engineer of
high reputation, (Mr Baldwin,) in 1825 That
he estimated they would cost each $300 000, but
the one at Charlestown co^t $677,089, and that
at Gosport $977,356, the average being about
|827,000, and he supposed the one at Brooklyn
would cost about that sum The committee had
no other estimates
Mr ELMORE resumed I have not had my
doubts removed, Mi Chairman, by the honoiable
gentleman's statements The necessity of this
additional dry dock is not unquestionable—they
are requned only foi repairs of a certain character
We never had one betore those at Chailestown
and Gosport were built, which has been but a very
few years past When, in 1824, Congiess fiist
entertained the scheme for making dry docks, a
call was made on the Commissioners oí the Navy
for information on the subject, that able, faithful,
and gallant veteran, Commodore Rodgeis, as their
organ, replied, that during peace "a single dry-
' dock might be made to answei the wants of oui
* present foice, but under other cncumstances,
' when the disposition of our vessels may be con-
' trolled by a variety of events, it will be found
' essentially necessary to have at least two of oui
' yards provided with this accommodation—one
' upon the waters of the Chesapeake, and anothei
' upon the eastern coast "—[1st Sess 19th Cong ,
Ex Doc No 143 ] Now, sir, those two here
recommended have been constructed, and located,
in my judgment, wisely—one at the eastern ex-
tremity of the Union, and one near the center of
the Atlantic coast, and I now, sir, insist, that if
a thud be built, it should be beyond the dangerous
capes of Florida, giving to each extremity, as well
as the center of the coast, this necessai y appendage
to the navy But, sir, has the chairman of the
Naval Committee shown the necessity to exist for
a third dry dock,especially now' Has he shown
the plans and estimates for its construction ' what
it is to cost' He tells us, sn, that the plan is the
same as that at Gosport and that at Charlestown,
and that the estimates for this at Brooklyn were
made by the same engineer, at the same time and
that each of the three was to cost only $300 000,
while the two which have been constructed cost
an average of $820,000, nearly three times the
estimate And, sir, I am satisfied that befoie
this work is finished, on the scale which will be
insisted on by those who urge it, as required by
the great commercial empoiium it is intended to
benefit, it will have cost nearer $2,000,000 than
$1,000,000
Sir, I must say with my friend fiom Georgia,
[Mr Dawson,] if another is necessary, that every
principle of equity and sound policy dictates that
it should be placed towards the other extremity
of the Union From Norfolk to Texas—more
than two thirds of your coast—where is there any
adequate means of building, repamrg, or fitting
out your ships' Why is it that all thi* section of
country at the South, which contributes so much
toyoui commerce and revenue, is to fee overlooked
and neglected' From it, sn, comes five sixths of
all the domestic exports of your whole country,
which are the main source and support of that
stupendous commerce which you carry on with
all the woild, enriching every section, and filling
the public coffers with its revenues, and yet, sir,
you neser think of establishing navy yards along
this coast, nor a dry dock at any part of it
Sir, I am glad that my friend and colleague has
offered his amendment for Pensacola It is the
great harbor of the Gulf of Mexico, thiough which
passes the immense commeice of the West and
Southwest Every dictate of common prudence
and common justice requires that the rich products
poured out of the bosom of these immense coun-
tries upon that gulf should have full and adequate
protection from your Navy It is the scene of
frequent piracy and shipwrecks innumerable. At
this moment, sir, you have the highest admoni-
tions of this, when France, by her fleets, is carry-
ing on war with our neighbors in these very
waters, winning strongholds, and making con-
quests upon our borders, while England, who
never sleeps when the interests of the people are
at stake, we are informed, has a strong fleet either
there or on its way to the scene of operations
Hai the House calculated the immense interests
we have at stake there' And can any statesman
who does estimate them properly, hesitate in sup-
porting the establishment not only of an extensive
navy-yard and depot there, but of a dry-dock also,
if another n to be added to those weaheady have'
In what, sir, are the local claims of Pensacola
behind those of Brooklyn ' Why crowd all the
naval conveniences in one section, and in such
contiguity' There is no dry dock within a thou
sand milesofit,and there aretwo within one fourth
of that from Brooklyn Why should your ships,
injured and disabled as they frequently must be,
and requmng the repans to be had in dry docks,
be foiced to double the dangerous capes of Florida,
and make a voyage to Gospoit or Charleston for
repairs—a voyage often dangerous in peace, and
often impossible in war' The depth of its harbor,
which is one of the most capacious and safe in the
United States, is abundantly great for any ship
Its bar at low tides affords twenty two feetwater,
which can easily be increased to thnty or forty if
required The tides rise but little the water is
quiescent, no rivers of any size empty into it, and
there is no danger to be apprehended that the
channel, which can be easily opened to any depth,
will again fill up Ihe suiveys made more than
a hundred years ago by the French, those after
wards by the English, and still later by our own
officers, show, sir, that the depth of water remains
the same, wholly unchanged It has a temperate
and healthy climate, and abundance of pure water,
and the live oak and other naval stores are the
natural and abundant products of the surrounding
country By a safe inland navigation, which a
trifling expense will make complete, as well as by
its railroads nowm progress, communications will
he opened to all paits of that boundless country
wateied by the Mississippi, from whence can be
poured down to it eveiything needed for subsist
ence or defense I repeat, t>ir, that if another diy-
dock is required, it is for this neglected portion of
the country Here, sir, it is needed, here it
would be useful in peace, and in wai mdispensa
hie and here, sir I will vote for it most cheerfully
You have wrung millions on millions from the
South by your unequal and unjust taxation, and
it is time, high t me, she bhoild oe in to know
this Government by its blebsmgs rather than its
oppressions
1 have, Mr Chairman, a word to say upon the
cost wh ch it is proposed by this bill and the
amendment of the gentleman from Pennsylvania
[Mr Piyntck] to incur The bill proposes
$100 OOOfor the dry dock at Brooklyn, the amend
ment $100,000 moie for Philadelphia But, sir,
this is but the beginninc tnat at Brooklyn will
not cost short of $1 000,000, and will probably go
considerably beyond it We have estimates for
that at Philadelphia, from the Department They
are as follows
lor a water lock............   $824 071 00
For di y aoek......        635,980 00
And if constructed on best plan
add.....................     150,000 00
$1 610 051 00
Three millions will, I am satisfied, be nearer the
mark Now, sir, is this committee prepared to
pledge itself and the country to these works, un-
necessary at, they are in this section of the Union,
where two alteady exist, m the present condition
of your Treasury' Are you not now struggling
with infinite difficulty to keep up the oidmary ex
penses of this Government'  Are not your neces
sary, indispensable expenditures constantly ire-
creasing? And does not your revenue ttteereetsf
periodically, every two years, by the reduction ift
your tariff, fixed by law ' How, sir, when fdar
expenses rise above, and your revenue smfts bel-
low, the point of equality, will you have themeaná
to continue useless and wasteful appropriations?
Sir, I beg leave to aay one word of warning to
gentlemen before they plunge their hands into the
public purse so freely, to seize on the treasures of
the people, and scatter them abroad on unneces-
sary undertakings If they expect to find the
means of supplying waste and extravagance m
the increase of the tariff, which is their only re-
souice, they will be mistaken The South ha 
submitted its last, wronged and oppressed as it
has been, it never will be again Deeply ha<s Its
dearest interests been wounded; and resolutely
and determinedly will it oppose an unyielding
resistance to every attempt for the renewal or en-
forcement of that system of unequal, unjust, and,
oppressive taxation, under which it was, for so
long a time, plundered for the benefit of other
ssctions
Mr C SHEPARD, of North Carolina, saidh«
had not expected to be dragged into this debate; Sot
the remarks of the gentleman from Virginia \JXtt-.
Wise] called for some notice on his part. That
gentleman had said that it was owing to a *ant
of industry and attention in a gentleman frorr)
North Caiohna, representing the Newborn dis-
trict, that had prevented the establishment of ft
navy-yard at the South After this, he sho'uld be
justified in troublirtg the House with some ex-
planation Fifteen months ago he had Ofierei* 
resolution for an inquiry into the fitness of Beau-
fort for a naval station Finding, on his return to
Congress, that nothing had been done, he ad-
dressed a letter to the Secretary of the Navy,
inquiring into the reason, and had been informed
that the officer charged with the examination had
been taken off to be united to the exploring ex-
pedition He had inquired at the last session of the
present Secretary whether such a survey would
not be made dunng the summer, and he had been
assured it should be done Since then he had
written another letter, informing him of the fact,
and inquiring into the reason He said this- that
his constituents might be able to judge whether fté
had neglected his duty Whatever the gentleman
from Vuginia might think, Mr. S was not re-
sponsible for the failure
Mr WISE The gentleman has gone off juáí
as if I had made a personal attack upon him 1
stated, and stated truly, that the Naval ComnwfWe
had been waiting for a report, at the reqfueát of ttíe
gentleman, befóte they decided between Beaufort,
Charleston, and Brunswick, that, in my opinion,
some injustice had been done to Charleston by the
delay
Mi SHEPARD resumed The gentleman bad
said that the reason why more was not done for
the southern States wai, that their Representatives
weie not so acme and diligent, and, in plain word's,
not «o cunning at getting appropriations, as those
from some other sections of the country
Mr WISE The remark was general I take
a full share of it to myself I am sorry I have not
a little more of that cunning myself
Mr SHEPARD As to the bill, the true ques-
tion is this whether an additional dry dock is
necessary for the service, and whether INew York
is the proper location for it We had now one
in New England, and one in Virginia, and where
ought the other to be' The documents read de-
clared that at least one more dock was required,
if so, it ought to be in some section of the Union
where a large and valuable commerce stood m
need of protection Was New York the proper
place' He thought not The gentleman frota
New York [Mr Hoffman] had referred to the
gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. Adams] as
having formeily shown that more money had been
appropriated for the South than for the North,
that when he got to Georgia he found himselff ir
ther north than in Massachusetts, and when he
came to Louisiana, he found himself ot the north
pole Mr S well remembeied the speech of the
honorable gentleman, it was not m relation to
appropuations, but to the money left oft deposit
