35th Cosf&....tst Sess.        ___________________Mississippi Election.—Mr. Towns,                                                  H. of Reps.
Executive authority of a State to order an elec-
tion to fill such vacancy, or vacancies, as the case
may be The very v ord " vacpncy" presupposes
an office once filled, but now vacant But this
lb not all The clause under consideration no*
only means that there must be a vacancy in the
repiesentation, hut that it must "happen," thereby
absolutely excluding the idea that the vacancy here
alluded to was to be the result of the regulai ope-
ration of law, but something unforeseen and unex-
pectedly happening, which, when occurring, should
be provided for bv the power vested in the Execu-
tive authority of the S ate But, sir, if the w ords
be not sufficient to give us the most unernng indi-
cation of the true meaning of the framets of the
Constitution, I ask gentlemen to consider the fouith
and second sections of the first article of that instal-
ment in connection, and no one, it seems to me
can doubt but that the fouith section was intended
to prescribe a rule by which alone the House of
Representatives was to be elected, and that the
second section was only intended to provide that,
should a vacancy happen by the death, íesignation,
or expulsion of a member by the House, such \ a-
cancy could be filled by the Executive au'honty of
the State This const! uctto i, Mr Speaker, gives
full effect to every portion of the Const tution, and,
I may also add, gives harmony, beauty, and
strength, to the iviolt plan of representation
But, sn, if it be masted that the case of these
gentlemen, (Messrs Claiooine andGhohon,) from
the facts ubmitied, constitutes a vacancy , m the
mean ng of the Constitution, you then, by such
conslruchcn, put to rest, for ever, the fourth sec-
tion of the firsf art cle of the Constitution, m order
to sustain the second sect en of the same artic'e
Sir, one of the bes' rules of construction for the
liberty of the people that this instrument can re-
ceive, is that v h ch Mill haimonise the whole with
all the parts—sustaining a'l, gi\ n g effect to all, to
the degree which the plain iuid ordinary at ceptation
of the words used would indicate Do this, sir,
now and hereafter, and the institutions of the
country are destined to ftomish, and become more
solid fiom age
Mr Speaker, what ate tl-e arguments of
gentlemen against the construction I contend foi'
The gentleman from New York, (Mr Bionson,)
insisted that there was a vacancy, m the meaning
of the Constitution, from the 4th of March last up
to the 1st of July, the time of the election of the
Mtt ng members He contended, and propeil),
too, that the time of serv ce fot the membeis of
the Twenty fourth Congress expired on the 3d of
March last Thus far he was right, but his con-
clusion from these facts that there was a vacancy,
is not authorized
Sir, even if it was liue, it would not help the
gentleman, unless he intends to prostrate, at one
b'ovv, the portion of the Constituí on which requires
the State legislatures to fix the time , places, and
manner of holding elections Whatever is cei am,
itnifoim, and regular, cannot be said to be acci-
dental, casual, or to "happen " But, sir, the law
of Mississippi absolutely prescribes the first Mon-
day in November, b ennially, as the time of ho'd-
mg the election fo representatives from that State,
and yet, when that law v as passed in Mississippi,
it was as well krov n th°n as now that the term of
-ervice of members expire 1 on the 3d of Maich
anterior to 1st Nov ember and that the State fiom
that time would have no repiimputation m the
Hou*e, and yet, sn, Mississippi had nothing to
fear, under ordinary encumstances, for the tim  of
the regular meeting ot Gongiess was fixed to the
fust Monday in December, everv year, until
otherwise changed b/ lav, when has not
been dore To this I m"} also and, that tne
power of the President to convt 1 e Congress on
extraordinary occasions was doibile«s Inown to
that Legislature of Mi ixs ppi which fixed on tí e
first Monday in November, bienniilly, for bold i g
elections for membeis oí Congress Yet, Mi
Speaker, with all these frets before is, wit1' a  ull
view ot the rowei of th  President undci the Con-
st isution, the Lcgis ature oí Mississippi, to whose
control alone, under the T deral Constitution, «
ptoperly entrusted th suljtxt, has inuught
propel to select, as the  lime oí holding electi n-
for rep-esentatives to Congress, the fiisl Monday in
November And now, this House is called i pon
to sustain the right of the s ttmg members to their
seats on this floor, on the ground that a vacancy
had happened in the representation from that S'ate
If, sir, the seats of the honorable gentlemen fiom
Mississippi are to be sustained, on the ground that
a vacancy has happened, I do not hesitate in say-
ing, as t! e resu't of a delibera e conviction, that
such a decision will annul the 4th section ot the 1st
article of the Constitution, and, perhaps what is
not of less cons°que"ce to t^e people of Mississip-
pi, their own State laws, securing to them the fiee
exercise of aright—dearer to fieemen than all
o'hers—the right of suffrage What, Mi Speaker,
is the apology for th s ruthless assault upen the
Constitution and laws of Misses pp i Why, su,
we are told that each S ate shall be represen cd,
and that the qualified voters of Mississippi have en-
joyed this privilege m the selectiun of the si ting
members This is f le, and so fai as the people are
cinceined, what they have.de no is most creditable to
them
But, sir, that is no argument foi this House Oui
duty is to mqune whether the Uting membeis
come here, accoidinz to the lorm and ceiemony
of law, foi íl they appear on this floor, otherwise
than by the ceremo íy of law, they have no official
character And if w e are true to the interest of the
people of Mississippi or any other State, no gentle-
man should be peimitted to speak in then name,
who v as not leturned heie, in pnisiiance of their
ow n State regulations Toi although a tempo-
rary inconvenience may insult to them in the pre-
se it msiance, yet the evil, if? the princip'e le
once established, may subject the n to bnlci disap-
pointment herealtci
Let us look itt'e moie ch s ly to this sub|Cct
Gentlemen m s pint ortheu vt vvs ot the majon-
tv, id i it th"t ul fi i Un entiases enilCirgics,
no vacancy u i ler the Coiulitution, wou'd have
"happened " Look, sir, at the magnitude of this
proposition Is it possible that the mere act of the
Pres dent can unsettle the law of all the States
regulating the e'ecuons1 Not only unsettle the lau
of the States, but ahsolu elv charge the Constitu-
tion of the United States, under which the
laws of the lespecttvc States aie autbon/ed,
and which enactments of the respective States are
the law of this House in settling ''uch questions1
Sir, the proposition is monstrous Give Vw power
to the Pres dent, and I as1 , e>f what materna
m J t no' this House, 1* composed' Let it 1« oí ce
admitted that the mere wil of the Pie ii'tiit, in
convoking Congress, constitutes a vacancy in the
States that may not have elected their lepresenla-
tion, and who will pretend to lorelell the disasfeis
that will bcfMl this counta' No, sit the Presi-

the decision of the House m that case1 Is there
an honorable membei in this hall who could doubt
as to which representation would be entitled to
their seats on this floor1 It reems to me that but
one opinion can be entertained, and if the represen-
tation chosen 1st November next, would be entitled
to then seats, as against the rights of those chosen
on ehe hist of Jdly, under the authority of the
Governor's proclamalion, I ask gentlemen to
point out the difTerence between the case supposed,
and the present Sir, the principle would be the
same, unless there be a masric power in the procla-
mation of the Piesidcnt, when he convokes an
exti \ session o<" Congress, wheteby he can cause
the law and Corstitatien to sleep, until the Execu-
tive of Mississippi can ordei and hold elections to fill
v acaneies where vacancies did not exist The Pres-
ident an t the Governor of Mississippi, by their
ji ml action, weuhl have the power, under this view
of the subject, to set a ide the law of elections of
the Sute of Mississippi, piovided the principle
contended foi by th  npoit of the committee be
correct
Mi Speakei, mv honorable fuend from Virgi-
nia, (Mr Penmbackei) in his very able speech on
this qnes ion, objected to a literal construction of
that p rt of the Consitution which «ays "when va-
cancies happen m the representation from any
State, the Executive authority thereof shall issue
writs of elect on to fill such vacarcies," on the
ground that if we adh"re lo ti e letter, should a va-
cancv happen, thorp is no power in the Executive
to fill such vacancy 1 1 el t ve, si', that there are
cases in th bods where then construction of
pen J |"U5, involving tie lile and liberty of the
icvustel, wotiUl s stain tie puieiple insisted on
by t íe gei I man But ue o"e the gentleman can
make ge d his posmoi, he si oulel at least show
lint 'h s clause o> tn° CiJitfuloti alls within the
reason of the decisions upon penal laws, a tasklap-
pi ehend my honorab'e friend will not attempt before
this House But, siys the honoiable gentleman,
in setthng upon the rights of the members to their
eits leic, we should take a*i enlarged and com-
prehensive \ pw of the \\ íole ground, having
constantly m mind that the boasted right of fiee-
men is a repr&cnt-Hien of their own choice And,
sir, the honoiabiegen lenan from New York, (Mr
Bionson,) with hie feelings with the gentleman
from Virginia averted " that the interest of
