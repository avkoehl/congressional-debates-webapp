No. 36. Report of Lieutenant Colonel Charles W. Knight, Thirty-first North Carolina Infantry.
HDQRS. 31ST REGIMENT NORTH CAROLINA TROOPS,Sullivan's Island, S. C., July 20, 1863.

CAPTAIN: I have the honor to make the following report of the part taken in the fight of Saturday, July 18, 1863, by this regiment at Battery Wagner:

The line occupied by my regiment extended from the second gun from the bomb-proof to where the gun was dismounted, part of the line from the sally-port on the right to the right of Colonel McKethan's command. The working parties from Cumming's Point were engaged out side the sally-port main entrance.

Owing to not being able to get my men in position where the busted gun was, we were repulsed; afterward made a charge upon them and were again repulsed. The number of men that made the charge was 20. The working party from Cumming's Point got in position in time to repulse the enemy at the main entrance.

The following are the casualties:

Officers and men	 Killed	 Wounded	 Missing	 Total

Commissioned 	 .......	 1	 .......	 1

officers

Enlisted men	 7	 30	 1	 38

Total	 7	 31	 1	 39

Captain [Allen B.] Parker fell, dangerously wounded, in rallying the men of Company I. It is useless to mention any officer or man when all were acting coolly and bravely.

Respectfully submitted.

CHAS. W. KNIGHT,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding.
