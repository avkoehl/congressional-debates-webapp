Major S. CARNCROSS,Assistant Adjutant-General, Second Army Corps:

MAJOR: I have the honor to submit the following statements with reference to absto absentees from this division:

There are now absent from the several regiments of this command and in hospitals at the North, 5,576 men. Of these 2 were sent away in 1861, 39 in 1862, 234 in 1863, 1,446 between January 1, 1864, and August 1, 1864, making 1,721 who have been absent over five months, and 1,694 who were sent away between August 1, 1864, and January 1, 1865, making 3,415 men, of whom I have a list of names and the hospitals where they now are; besides these, there are 2, 161 men whose names I have, but whose whereabouts arte unknown, the surgeons in whose hospitals they are having faziled to report them, amking an aggregate, as above, of 5,576 men. I therefore must respectfully request that a board to consist of Major N. Church, Twenty-sixth Michigan Volunteers, Surg. James E. Pomfret, Seventh New York Volunteer Artillery, and Captain John S. McEwan, Seventh New York Volunteer Artillery (of the division staff)-be authorized to visit the different hospitals throughout the North as examinesrs, with a view to the return to duty of such men of this division as may be improperly remaining in said hospitals. The greater number of the men are in hospitals in the District of Columbia, Pennsylvania, and New York. I believe that by this means at least one-half of the men thus absent will be returned to the command.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

NELSON A. MILES,
