Our medical director may call on you for a steamer fo suitable draught and size to answer as hospital store-ship in case our operations should make it necessary on the York or James Rivers. There will be many other things required in that event. I propose to see you in person about the matter as soon as I can calculate more definitely than it is possible to do now. I shall send you by mail to-day a statement of what land transportation General Burnside's column will require.
