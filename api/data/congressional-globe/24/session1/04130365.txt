Mr. CAMBRELENG sard be fcoald not fiad
any previous act authorizing this appropriabtin,
and an that ground he moved to strike it oat. •
Mr. STOKER hopea the gentleman would not
press the motion then, as the gentleman repre-
senting that district was,out of bis seat; whece*-
apon
Mr. CAMBRELENG withdrew it, intimating
that he should renew it in the Hoase rf there vas
no eaistiog law authorizing it, and he had beca
unable to discover one.
The following-clause being read:
For office rent aad Awl for alt the tsuayait «flees,
Mr. CAMBRELENG remarked that it waa
proper he should state that thia was a new item,
though he should not move to strike it out nil he
heard whether it wris necessary or not.
Mr. WISE thought lteonld not be possible
that our surveyors wanted a sum of |2,1C0 for
the purchase of fuel in the northwestern wilder-
ness, where that article was of no pecuniary
value.
1     Mr. JOHNSON, of Louisiana, replied that all
the offices wore1 not in the northwest; and office
rent was in some places so high that the salary
1 of the surveyors was freqently greatly diminished
by it.
Mr. ASHLEY advocated- the «lause.
!     Mr. CORWiN was satisfied that, instead of
striking out the item, it ought to be doubled, for
i it was with in his own knowledge that the survey-
ors m Illinois arid Indiana hadto pay as much as
from $500 to #£00 «flies vent.
Mr. OWENS, with a view <hw said) of testing
the sense of the committee, moved to strike out
the item.                          i
! Mr. LAWLER moved ts amend the clause by
ttn additional item, appropriating a sum not ex-
ceeding |3(J9rbf office rent to the several regis-
ters and receivers of the public moneys.
Mr. JOHNSON, of Teftneaseo, was opposed
both to the amendment and to the original clause.
These- contingent provisions were conttmntlly
increasing, and he saw no reason for these etttra
allowances at the present tima. The officers in
question ha<í done witftoutthsm for twenty years,
ktii should eontintte to-éVeoy a* least until some
^ood reason was given for-the ihemee.
Mr, JOHNSON, of Lomsiana, bfiefiy advo-
cated th« originar prevision and tbe •amendment.
Mr. HAROlN hoped « • stsua  w««Jd be
stricken out, for these mersaxeswere-SoatinaaUy
taking place, an* né rettttsttori was ever made,
nor any 'office abtrtiahetl. These things were aug-
menting by httfe and hnle, as they had done in
the old r/ottiWrieS of EwrOpe, till at length wc
should, have an army of offiée-hoMers, with all
their various classes, gnwles, mitt subordinates.
Ft was in this way that the expenditure of this
tJfoVemmeht had swelled from, tw«4ve to^Wenty
rjiiiltptte within a fewyeat-s.                   !      *
Mf. LAWLER adVActtted htsawtetfdmenf. ft
was no good reason that jnsticé'shonld be with-
He(d from one elásá of ofXcors becaufee ethers
received a higher' «ómr*rrsil¡ dn than they w*re
entitled to, or because others' rritght ask for what
Was unequal or unjust. By this rule,no allowance
would ever be made to any officers if they were
to withhold a jast remuneration from one «lass
because another m'gh1 ask for wJl 1 wa.  mrea-
sotlable.
Mr. RIPLEY WW as great a sticJilW for econ-
omy as the getttferaah trWtf Kerrtttcky, but then
they ought not to  friirJose—he •won-M not say
tupon the officers, but upon the people, i^érry
duties withooi a due compensation. Now, in the
district where he hved, not a man could be, got
to accept the office, anl the Wnscqtrenee was that
not an acre of land was neW in one of the most
important agricultura] points in the country" under
patents. No man «saw  aooept the ap^otutasent,
for the ossnpensatioo, was so miserable andeesi-
temptislc, that ho man eonld g* there with sss
family without mvorvihe himself 10 dsbt.
Mr.  VANDERPOEL was- 0p| ss4 to¡ the
amendment.   If it could be maile to appear that
these officers did not receive enough, the better
way would be to increase their ssianes, without
tTOimwrisatir^tlitm'mdBiimd wtmode. Should
