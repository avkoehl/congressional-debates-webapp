August 11, 1862.

Colonel SCHRIVER, Chief of Staff:

COLONEL: If there is a suspension of hostilities, why am I sent out to make a reconnaissance? The enemy know I am here now and they may attempt to cut off my return by this road. Is this allowable under a suspension of hostilities? I ask for information, for I feel badly about this. Write me.

Yours, &c.,

GEO. D. BAYARD,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
