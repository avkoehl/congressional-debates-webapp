LEXINGTON, July 17, 1864.

Major General J. M. SCHOFIELD:

I have positive information that another rebel invasion, more formidable than the last, is imminent. In addition, the day is fixed for a general insurrection in this State of rebel sympathizers to assist the raiding forces and act in concert with them. You are aware how small my force is. I have called on Governor Morton and General Heintzelman for troops. If dismounted cavalry is to be sent back here, would it not be well to have it start at once! I can use every man I can get, and I believe I shall need them.

S. G. BURBRIDGE,

Brevet Major- General.

General BURBRIDGE:

I will send you the One hundred and FIFTY- sixth Regiment, Colonel C. Marker, and the seven companies of the One hundred and sixty- fifth, Lieutenant- Colonel Bohlender. They should reach you to- day. You must not uncover Covington, as this leaves there an inadequate garrison. Please keep me advised of the movements of the enemy as well as of your own.

My forces occupy Mount Sterling, Winchester, and Boonesborough, with orders to scout all roads leaving eastward.
