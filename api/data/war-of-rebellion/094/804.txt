General S. COOPER:

General Taylor reports from Meridian yesterday that 2,500 white and 6,000 black troops were in New Orleans on 5th instant, and that one of Thomas' army corps is reported to have gone down the Mississippi; destination supposed to be Mobile. General Maury reports about 6,000 of enemy at Pascagoula.

General S. COOPER:

General Hood reports loss of all his pontoon train-83 boats, 150 wagons, and 400 mules-due to inability of General Roddey to bring his troops from their homes. I wish to substitute another brigade in its place, and put all the cavalry of this department under one commanding general-Forrest.

General S. COOPER:

City land defenses next the lower bay, where enemy will probably attack, are still unfinished. System of barbette guns adopted for land batteries worst possible; their fire will be silenced by enemy's sharpshooters as soon as they get within range.

J. B. HOOD,
