General McPHERSON,

Commanding Seventeenth Army Corps:

GENERAL: The general commanding directs me to say that from a man just captured he is assured that Meridian is abandoned. He also says Lee is on your right flank. He wishes you to have the train will cared for, and you may also support the brigade sent to the railroad by the whole division if necessary. Our cavalry are over the creek, and he expects every moment to hear of their occupation of Meridian. He believes the enemy gone and place burned.

I am, general, yours, &amp;c.

L. M. DAYTON.

General McPHERSON,

Commanding Seventeenth Army Corps:

GENERAL: The commanding general directs me to send the inclosed paper for information.* He says you may move your command into Meridian or camp it on this creek, where there is good ground, as you wish. Although, we have no tidings from the front, he is sure Meridian is in our possession, for the cavalry has been over for two hours and General Smith's whole division is over, t he advance crossing one hour and a half since. General Hurlbut's command will be cmaped south toward Enterprise to-night. Your division, in support of the brigade sent to the railroad and guarding the train, he sayd, can be well employed on the railroad at Tunnel HIll and Chunky's Stations at your discretion. The reserve train he prefers remaining whwere it is, as the supplies therein he designs for use on the return. We have plenty here of forage and provisions. We have no positive information from General Sooy Smith but report from the inhabitants places him thirty miles north, on the Mobile and Ohio Railroad, yesterday. The general wishes to see you in person to-night. Your dispatch of 12 m. just received.

I am, general, with respect, yours, truly,

L. M. DAYTON.

Aide-de-Camp.
