HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
Saturday, March 5,1842
The journal of yesterday was read and approved
DAILY HOUR OF MEE 11NG
Mr TALIAFERRO rose, and was understood to say, that it
would be recollected that several days ago a resolution had been
adopted fixing the daily hour of the meeting of the Hou&e, on
and after Monday neict, at e'even o clock until further notice,
and that he had given notice of a motion to reconsider
Itw«.s always unpleasant to him to go countei to the ex
pressed opirinm of the House, but believing as be dirt that the
same reason which induced the House to fix the dailv 1 oui at
twelve- o'clock id the commencement of the sesión st 31 conti
nued, he lelt bound to =mh*mt th*- nruiotiof which he had given
notice That reason heHehevelj v. as founded on thisconside
ration the morning* in Decemoer were t o short to allow a
sufficient period of time for the operations of the committees
His impression wa* that the same reason btill existed ami tip

until at least oome time afrer the spring equinox
Mi i remarking that gentleman had had abundant time to
make up then mnds since the- adoption oi theiesolution as to
tiie propriety of reconsideration, said he would, to avoid the
chance ^f a debxte  move &? previous question
Mr riLLMORE<notnavmg been able to hear Mi Talxa

was
The SPEAKER having explained
Mr TaLUFERRO, at the request of Mr. Fillmore, and
on his pledge to renew it, withdiew the motion for the previous
question
Mr FILLMORE then said that he desired to call the atten
tion of the House to the situation of the public business before
the rote toieconsidt-r wa  taken
He had communications fr^m the War Department, stating
that the fund of the Quarter! lister *  Depaitment was exhaust
ed, and that in appropuation was immediately wanted to
cany on the wai inliort'-- lit- had asot unmmiicmona

that 1>| ailment were aso e^chau ted And h> believed it had
been statu} a few days si ice, that oi e of oui vessels now m
«■ommi^ion and a'mo-strpaly to sad was defray* d for want of
the neces«uy appiopnation-5
In ad hti m to this it was to be bo^ne m mmd that more than
three month--ot ) e session ban now tlapsed and vet only one
genera! bilí had been pa«n?d It was also to be borne m
mind that (Sere was airea !y an amount of husmeas upon
the ible wluth ha i been prepared by 'he committee more than
co^l'h dispose1 of (even if i u House now en mm t ced meet
ing at eleven o'clock) between this time and the fir^t uf August
next
He knew that the objection to meeting at eleven o clock was,
that the committee baa not time t > di<;thargp their duties, and
that was the c nly obiection that could be mged
But he woiii I ask the atten ion of the House to the ''act that
the Committee of V ays and Means was chaig^ 1 with aa much
andas labonous business as aiwcomm tt-°e- of the Hoi c -md
he Vtonfd now &tate that it wa by tue uianimouse rcqjestof

of i^tren hment and iefo m which would from present
appeaiances, defci final action on tnat bill till the month of
June
The House had frot yet pas ed on the loan bill They had
not yet acted on the appropriation bills No icvenuebdl had
yet passed., yei all these things, besidesan immense amount of
private bilH, were to b acted on, or Congress must adjo irn
withou demg tt s business of lhe country Ifthccommmeps
were to meet at nine or half pa=t rime o'clock, they tould dis
charge ill the duties imposed upon them, and give one houi

At the e&tia beasion they met here a'most fiom the com
