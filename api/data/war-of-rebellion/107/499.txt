HEADQUARTERS GENERAL McCLELLAN,October 21, 1861.

General STONE,

Edwards Ferry:

What facility have you for crossing the river at Edwards Ferry and at Harrison's Island? Is there any road from Seneca to Leesburg; and are there any boats at Seneca? Please direct several mounted men to hold themselves in readiness to carry messages from Poolesville to Darnesville [Dranestown].

R. B. MARCY,

Chief of Staff.

EDWARDS FERRY, October 21, 1861-2.20 p. m.

General R. B. MARCY:

We cross at Edwards Ferry in flat-boats (three), which we have built, capacity forty-five men each, and in one canal boat, capacity 200 men; at Harrison's Island in four flat-boats and four row-boats. There is a road from Seneca to Edwards Ferry and from Edwards Ferry to Leesburg; also a road from opposite Seneca to the Leesburg road. The mounted men will be held in readiness. Firing pretty heavy on our right, but advancing.

C. P. STONE,

Brigadier-General.

McCLELLAN'S HEADQUARTERS,

October 21, 1861.

Brigadier General C. P. STONE,

Edwards Ferry:

Is the force of the enemy now engaged with your troops opposite Harrison's Island large? If so, and you require more support than your division affords, call upon General Banks, who has been directed to respond. What force, in your opinion, would it require to carry Leesburg? Answer at once, as I may require you to take it to-day; and, if so, I will support you on the other side of the river from Darnestown.

GEO. B. McCLELLAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

EDWARDS FERRY, October 21, 1861-1 p. m.

Major-General McCLELLAN,

Commanding Army of the Potomac:

I think Evans is 4,000 strong, with perhaps four or more pieces of field artillery, and, say, three pieces masked. Prisoners state that he expects re-enforcements. I believe this command can occupy Leesburg to-day. We are a little short of boats.

C. P. STONE,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
