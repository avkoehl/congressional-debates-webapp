THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

this board, among other things, the duty of
improving the streets, avenues, and alleys in
the District. The District government, with
great liberality, placed in their hands a large
amount of money with which to carry out
the purposes of the act. In doing this the
board necessarily encountered streets, avenues,
and alleys in front of and around public build-
ings, reservations, and property of the U nited
States. It was impossible to complete these
improvements in any one instance without in-
volving an expenditure of money in front of
Government property. They took the respons-
ibility to complete these improvements with-
out leaving gaps wherever Government prop-
erty might intervene. In doing this they
incurred liabilities, a large amount of which
they have already discharged, and in doing so
were obliged to make an advance from the
funds of the District to pay for the improve-
ments in front of Government property, and
the object of this bill is to refmia to them the
amount thus advanced. I will not say the
Government is legally liable for this amount,
but I do say that it is morally liable, and many
precedents will warrant the appropriation.
ECONOMY AJiD DURABILITY OF WORK PERFORMED.
It is proper that the House should know
whether the work for which they are asked
to pay has been economically and efficiently
made. This subject was very fully entered into
by the Committee for the District of Columbia
at *,he last session. The committee reported
that they were unable to find that the board
could have procured the work at a less price
than was paid, I believe that the work of
various descriptions which has been done wag
done from fifteen to thirty per cent, cheaper
than like work iti any city in the country, con-
sidering the price of materials in this market.
Take the item of pavements and compare with
the known prices in any other city of the U nion,
and what I say will prove true not only as to
pavements but other work. The contractor
has been required to give security that he will
keep the pavement in repair at his own ex
pense for three years from the date of its
completion, a condition which, I believe, has
never been imposed in any other city. There
has been the closest supervision and super-
intendence of the work by competent men
from first to last; and while doubtless here
and there may be found defective work, in
the main I believe that it has been well done.
Besides, the bill now before the House requires
that the payment shall be made upon the
vouchers approved by the officer in charge
of public buildings and grounds, after full
examination and measurement of the improve-
ments.
IMPROVEMENT Of STREETS PAID VOB BY THE OENBRAI,
GOVERNMENT COMPARED WITH THE COST TO THB
CITY FOR THE SAME.
Examination of the public records of the
country will show that since 1802 the General
Government has expended for the improve-
ment of our streets and avenues $1,321,288 31.
During the same period the city of Washington
has expended $13,921,767 15, or the citizens
have paid ninety percent, and the Government
ten per cent,, and I leave out of this com-
putation nearly $2,000,000 which have been
expended by Georgetown and the county of
Washington ; andyet, Mr. Speaker, the United
States, as we shall see before I finish, owns
and has owned not less'than two fifths of the
city of Washington.
Perhaps J may as well here as elsewhere
give in tabular form the value of real estate
held by the United States in Washington city:
.1. Value of the ground of Government reserva?
tions estimated by a commission in 1870, under
organic act   816,186,334 99
l/ost of the public buildings erected on
the above grounds, obtained from the
appropriations made for the purpose
to date  30,548,426 12
Total $46,734,761 11
2. The present value of the ground of the above
reservations is estimated at  $25,000,000 00
3. The amount paid by the Government for the
above reservations was 836,099 00
4. Tho Govornment was donated every alternato
lot. nr altogether 10,136 lots, having an area of
o5,(>88,480 square feet. Estimating the present aver-
age value of the same at fifty cents per square foot,
would give as total value of the lots 832,814,240 00

| It has been urged that the Government does
not own this property in fee. An examin-
ation of the original deed of June 29, 1871,
and the case of Van Ness et ux. vs. City of
Washington and the United States, (4 Peters,
page 232,) together with the opinions of the
Attorneys General Wirt and Cushing, will
show the contrary. These improvements are
adding daily to the substantial wealth of the
United States, and upon every principle its
property should pay its just proportion.
It will be difficult, Mr. Speaker, for persons
unacquainted with the progress and improve-
ments here for the past year to comprehend
their extent. Wherever we go throughout the
city are found the finest pavements leading in
every direction ; the privilege of sewers and
water-mains has been given to the citizens in
almost every part of the city, until we are no
longer a reproach and disgrace to visitors ; but
the capital of the nation is fast becoming the
glory of the nation. To give the House some
idea of these improvements,' I read extracts
giving a computed statement of extent and
cost of certain improvements made as appear
from the report of the Board of Public Works,
November, 1871:

ASSESSMENT.
I have been asked by members many times
recently whether this vast work is not impos-
ing a burdensome taxation upon tho people.
Admitting that it does, the obligation would
seem to be the stronger on the Govern-
ment to do justice to our citizens by reliev-
ing them of part of this burden. While it iB
true that in some instances the assessments
are burdensome, and subject property-owners
to great pecuniary inconvenience, still the
enhancement of property has been so great and
| the immediate benefits so manifest, that gen-
erally our people have borne the assessments
with cheerfulness. In this connection I want
: to submit a comparative statement of assess-
' ments made per front foot of property improved
1 by the late corporation and by the Board of
Public Works:
| Corporation assessment for a street one hundred and
| ten feet wide, the carriage-way paved with rough
bluesione pavement.
70 square feet of carriage-way of rough blue rock, at
j $1 35 per square yard.....   -.......$10 50

Of which $11 18i was assessed to property per front
foot.

way paved with first-class wood pavement.
40 square feet of carriage-way of first-class wood
pavement, at $3 50 per yard $15 55

40 square feet of parking.  2 22
Total .$26 10
Of which $4 35 was assessed to property per front
foot.
The House will perceive that for a trifle
more the Board of Public Works have made
a first-class wooden pavement upon the same
streets which under the old corporation was
laid with rough blue rock, and that while that
rough block pavement cost the property-holder
$11 18£ per front foot, an improved wooden
pavement cost the property-holder $4 36 per
front foot.
Take another instance, when Congress or-
dered the city to pave Pennsylvania avenue,
from, the Capitol to the Treasury Department,
it imposed on the property-holders under the
old corporation an expense of abont twenty
dollars per front foot. The Board of Public
Works have paved Pennsylvania avenue, from
Seventeenth street to Georgetown, with wooden
prepared pavement at a cost to the property-
holder of $4 80 per front foot.
Under the old corporation, I street, between
Seventeenth and Eighteenth streets, paved
with rubble stone, cost $4 75 per front foot;
I street, between Sixth and Seventh streets,
paved with blue rock, coat $4 82 per front
foot; Indiana avenue, between Third and
Fourth streets, paved with blue rock, cost
$9 74 per front foot. Compare this with the
pavements laid under the Board of Public
Works on streets of like width. Twelfth street,
between _ Pennsylvania avenue and F street,
paved with wood, cost $4 60 per front foot;
New York avenue, as wide as Indiana avenue,
paved with asphalt and parked in the center,
cost about ten dollars per front foot. I give
these few Instances at random, to show the
