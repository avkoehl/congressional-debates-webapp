have not yet reported at Canton. This tallies with General Grant's in formation from other sources. Johnston says that he shall have his 40,000 in time to save Vicksburg.

Pardon me for again urging that re-enforcements be at once sent here from Tennessee, Kentucky, or Missouri in numbers sufficient to put our success beyond all peradventure. The same messenger who bears this to Memphis bears also General Grant's orders for 7,000 men from Hurlbut's forces to be sent here at once; but this will not meet secure and the result incomparably more certain than our position and its result at Corinth last year. The place is far more important. Its ultimate possession ought to be assured by all the means in our power. Better retreat to Nashville than retreat from the hills of Vicksburg.

BEHIND Vicksburg, June 3, 1863-8 a. m.,

VIA MEMPHIS, June 6-Noon. (Received June 7-6. 15 p. M.)

The expeditionary corps under F. P. Blair, which has been resting for two days at Haynes' Bluff after its recent march of 90 miles in five days, will be back to-night, and will take its position on the extreme left of our investing lines, filling the space hitherto occupied by pickets of enemy between J. G. Lauman and the Mississippi. This will render the investment total, and as soon as the rifle-pits and field works are completed in that part of the line it will be impassable.

On the night of the 1st instant we had an alarm on McClernand's front, and it was supposed that the enemy were about to attempt a sally. Their attack on a pioneer company was soon repulsed, and they fell back. Our lines are now so strong from the extreme right around to McClernand's left, that 5,000 troops can hold them against any sortie.

General Grant has ordered heavy re-enforcements from Hurlbut's command. W. S. Smith's DIVISION, five brigades, 7,000 strong, N. Kimball, above 5,000, and from A. Asboth's command 5,000, are on their way. The first brigade of Kimball arrived here yesterday. The line between Dodge's left and Memphis will be confined to the shortest railroad, and should Joe Johnston, finding all lost at Vicksburg, make a sudden dash at Memphis, General Grant will have to rely on the vigilance of Hurlbut's cavalry and the rapidity of his own transport steamers to get re-enforcements there in season. The outpost here toward the northeast is at Mechanicsburg, 3 miles east of Satartia, where it is supplied by steamers. It consists of one brigade under J. A. Mower, with two cavalry regiments. The latter have again been sent out to attempt the northern railroad bridge over Big Black. All the roads by which the enemy can approach are being filled with every practicable obstruction. Of this last work much has already been well done.

All our reports keep Joe Johnston still at Canton. The siege works steadily progressing on the whole line. Those prosecuted with the least energy and the least intellectual effort are, I regret to say, those of General F. Steele. His inertia is surprising. His camps are also in very bad order and very dirty. I. F. Quinby leaves again to-day on account of sickness, and J. E. Smith takes his DIVISION.

Secretary of War.
