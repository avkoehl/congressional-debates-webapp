SPECIAL ORDERS, HDQRS. FIRST DIV., TENTH ARMY CORPS,Numbers 79. In the Field, Va., July 23, 1864.

The section of First Connecticut Light Battery now in position in Battery Numbers 1 will proceed immediately to Deep Bottom, Va., reporting upon arrival at that place to Brigadier General R. S. Foster, commanding Third Brigade.

By order of Brigadier General A. H. Terry:

A. TERRY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HDQRS. THIRD Brigadier, FIRST DIV, TENTH ARMY CORPS,Deep Bottom, July 23, 1864.

Brigadier General A. H. TERRY,

Commanding First Division, Tenth Army Corps:

The enemy occupy the edge of the woods, they being too strong to be dislodged by Colonel Hill to-day. We have had 4 or 5 men wounded. I think it necessary that there should be two guns in the earth-work on the bluff below Four-Mile Creek, as they would render the position of any battery the enemy might attempt to place on my right very insecure. They also would assist in repelling any attack of the enemy on that part of the line, and assist materially in driving the enemy from the woods if we wish to occupy them. I think the position of so much importance that if they cannot be sent me I shall take two guns from my line here, although it would weaken it to do so.

Respectfully, yours,

R. S. FOSTER,

Brigadier-General.
HDQRS. DEPT. OF VIRGINIA AND NORTH CAROLINA,In the Field, July 23, 1864.

General FOSTER,

Deep Bottom:

General Grant hears some firing again up our way and wants to know what it is. Please inform us at once.

G. WEITZEL,

Brigadier-General.

BEEP BOTTOM, VA., July 23, 1864.

Brigadier-General WEITZEL:

There is no firing here except an occasional shot by the gun-boats into the woods in front of my line below Four-Miles Creek. The Eleventh Maine hold a position covering the road from New Market to Malvern Hill. All is quiet along my lines.

Respectfully,

R. S. FOSTER.

(Forwarded to Lieutenant-General Grant.)
