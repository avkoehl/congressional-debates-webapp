■when and m what manner she will exercise her
authority within her own territory' Is she to
submit to this Government, or to a foreign Gov-
ernment, her views of the expediency or necessity
of employing a force to sustain her civil officers
in the execution of their duty, before she may be
peimitted to do it' Suppose she had done as the
Senators seem to think she ought to have done,
and,in the one case, this Goveinmcnt had advised
or dnected her to stay her hand: do you think,
Mr Piesident, that she would have been bound
to obey such advice or direction, and suffer for-
eign plunderers to have carried off her property'
Oi,in the other case,that Sir John Harvey should
have adiistd or commanded her to treat her laws
as a dead letter, because he had a warden to look
aftei trespasseis, to seize the timber, and to put
the pioceeds into the "disputed teiiitoty fund "
think you that Maine -would haveyielded to such
advice or eommand ' Would you, ox any honor
able Senatoi here, desire her thus to disgnce her-
self Did Sir John Hai vey ever think it due to
Mame to give notice to her that he would appoint
a warden of this teiutory' or that that warden
■would seize timhci oi ariest tiespassois on the
disputed temtoiy' Nevei, then why ask Maine
to do so'
Iho Governor of Mame, as wns his duty, has
«ndei taken to execute the laws of the State with
in the limits of the State, and was undei no obli-
gation to communicate his intention of doing so
 o any man or to any Government, and is ame-
nable only to his constituents In the execution
of this duty the Governor is met by the demand
of&foieign Government to stay his hand, on the
assumption that the exclusive jurisdiction in the
disputed ttrntoi y belongs to that Government,
and is notified thai, unless he withdiew his land
agent and foice from that temtory,an armed
foice will be employed to expel them- Why this
claim to exclusive jurisdiction' Whcio is the
agieement of which Sir John Haivey and the
British Minister speak' The existence of such
agreement is denied to 8u John, and he is asked
to point to it. He has not yet answeied It is
denied to her Majesty's Minister, (Mr Fox,)
and he is called upon for the evidence to sustain
his assertion  Aitu the lapse of two days, he
studs us his protest «gainst om denial, and in
fomisus that he will bend home and obtain th<
«In. etions of hei Majesty's Government If hei
Mijesty's Ministers cannot find it, what then'
Will Sir John be called home, and his acts dis-
avowed' Will hei Mimstir be ucalhd, and th<
elaim to exclusive jmisdiotion be abandoiltd'
No, sir, no We have now the authouty of this
Government foi saying that no sue h exclusive
juiisdictiori in the disputed tointoiy exists in
Gieat Kiit-un as Su John and Mt Fox pietcnd,
and the at ts of the Governor of Maine aie sus
tutud We have the assuianre of the Governor
and of the Legislatuie of Maine that hei laws
shall be executed, and that her foice will not be
withdiawn so long as she has means of insisting
an attack upon them Should Sn John Haivey
proceed to execute his tlucat, the blood of the
liaidy sons of Maine will be freely sliLd befoie
Sir John's purpose can be accomplished It has
been said that Maine should not have hazjuded
the peace of the nation upon the boundary ques-
tion while that was a subject of negotiation, and
one Senatoi has said that he had no idea of the
nation being diawn into a war by the rtsh pio-
ceedings ot any State.
Mr. President, how is this question of bound-
arya subject of negotiation' lias Gieat Britain,
since the rejection of the advice of the King of
the Netherlands, ever consented to open a nego-
tiation a  to this boundary line, upon the imsii of
the treaty of 1783' Not at all Ever since 1832
this Government ha3 been pressing the Govern-
ment of Great Britain to enter into such a nego
tiation, and that Government has constantly re-
fused it, insisting that the tieaty line was so
defectively described that it was impossible to
locate it, and has constantly endeavored to obtain
a conventional line instead of the treaty line And
what has been the result' In Januaiy, 1838, the
Butish Government proposed to this Government
to foim a convention for the appointment of a
commission to make certain explorations, without
authority to decidt the question, and to report their
doings to each Government. That proposition
was accepted nearly a year ago, much to my le-
gret, and what has come of it' We learn by the
annual message of the President that nothing had
been done. In answer to a very recent call of
the Senate, we are told that no conespondence
has been had upon the subject since the annual
message Hence, their own proposition, made
moie than a year ago, and accepted more than
ten months-ago, has fallen to the giound, is not
attempted to be carried out, and may well be
regaided a dead letter The truth is, there is no
negotiation that can or will settle the line, and
there will be none till the necessities of the case
shall bring it about, and however much the hor-
rors of war are to be deplored, this boundary
question must be settled, and recent events may
accomplish that object, peaceably, I hope, but if
the territory justly ouis cannot be defended and
preset ved to us but by arms, then, Maine says,
and the nation will say, it must and shall be de-
fended
Mi TALLMADGE moved the printing of the
message and documents, with five thousand extra
copies of both, which was accordingly ordered
The message and documents were then referred
to the Committee on Foreign Relations.
I'-VETY POLIllCb
REMARKS OF Mr. RIVES and Mr ROANE,
OF VIRGINIA,
In the Senate, February 15, 1839
Mr Roane having concluded his speech,
Mi RIVES rose and requested Mr Norvell
to yield him the floor. He would make an earn-
est appeal to the courtesy of that gentleman, as
he considered it due to himself to reply to what he
conceived to be a personal attack by his colleague
Mi. NORVELL replied, ceitainly he would
yield the floor, if it was the intention of the Sen-
ator to go on with his remarks at once He had
thice times already yielded the floor to gentlemen
who made the request of him, and the Senator
fiom Vuginia [Mr Rivi-s] could not expect him
to yield it foi to monow
Mi RIVES said it was his intention to reply
at once He confessed that he had nevei, in the
whole couise of his life, been so much astonished
as he had been at the unprovoked and unjustifi-
able attack of his colleague. Had a thunder-
bolt fallen at his feet, he could not have been
moie surpiiscd His suiprise at the extraoidi-
naiy couise which his colleague had thought
proper to take, was only equaled by his íegret,
a íegiet, excited not by any peisonal injury
infla ted on him, but for the injury inflicted
on the reputation which belonged to their com
mon mothci, Viignua, for all that was generous
and chivadle Although his colleague and him-
sell had diffi red on important political questions
for the last two years, yet they had always been
on the mostcoidialand fnendly terms, and never
did he, until this moment, appiehend any othei
than the most friendly feelings What was he
to think of the mannei of the attack made on him
and the tune chosen for it' His colleague had
spoken of the fnendly and kind feelings he had
enteitained for him, and asciibed his silence huh
erto to motives of delicacy, and yet he had come
foi ward with a preconceited attack on him for
his course for the last two years, an indictment
enumeiating all his offenses against the party for
the last two years Why, he would ask, did he
reseive and treasure up all his indignation and
excitement to this moment' Was this delicacy'
Did not his colleague know that now, at this very
moment, in the Capitol of Richmond, his politi-
cal enemies were consummating the sacrifice be-
gun here' Yes, sir, (said Mr. R ,) now, at this
moment that my colleague has chosen to enumer-
ate all the offenses which I have committed for
the last two years, the altar is prepared where I
am to be immolated as the victim His colleague
no doubt had intelligence of this fact
Mr ROANE here interposed, and said that his
information received heretofore, and that which
he had received to-day, was of a different char-
acter It left him no reason to doubt of the íe-
election of hia colleague.
Mr RIVES continued His colleague had se-
lected the 15th day of Febiuary, 1839, the day
when his political friends at Richmond were, pei-
haps, doing public execution to me ' Just as I
am in what he and his party may oil the last
agonies of political dissolution, but which I look
on as the proudest moments of my life—just as
I am about to depart to another stage of existence,
he rakes up from every forgotten source a long
catalogue of political sins for the last two yeais,
and presents them to rack my conscience and dis-
tract my mind ' Is this delicacy' Is this what
might be expected from a colleague—a man, too,
fiom the Old Dominion' He had heard fiom
seveial sources that his colleague had sent,undei
his own fiank, tovauous paitsof Vuginia, many
copies of the virulent and outrageous attack made
on him by the Senator fiom Connecticut, [Mr.
Niles,] which was so entuely void of argument
or reason that he had disdained to reply to it.
Was this a pi oof of his delicacy' He did not
complain of this as being beyond the privilege of
his colleague, butwhen Mr Roane claimed ciedit
for delicacy in the Senate, it is somewhat remark-
able that he was not actuated by the same motive
and feeling out of the Senate
His colleague had spoken of his Demoeiacy,
which was now, it seemed, the distinction which
the dominant party ariogated to itself He had
never said that he was a Democratic Republican.
That title was unknown to oui glorious fathers;
the simple woid Republican was their title, and it
was his This Government of ouis is a Repub-
lic, not a Democracy Democrat was the title
bestowed on Republicans by the revileis of re-
publicanism, and was never assumed by the Re-
publicans, at least south of Mason and Dixon's
line. The distinguished ancestor of the gentle-
man, in whom the State of Virginia took such
just pride, had never called himself a Democrat.
Mr ROANE To which of my ancestors does
the gentleman allude'
Mi. RIVES    To the late Judge Roane.
Mi ROANE. You are mistaken, sir He
was a Democrat He gloued in being a Demo-
crat
Mr RIVES continued his remarks, comment-
ing on the efforts that were making in Richmond
to defeat his election, again alluded to the speeches
of the Senator from Connecticut, which he said
his colleague had franked to the members of the
Vuginia Legislature, and said that he had heaid
that his colleague had written letters to the mem-
bers of the Legislature having the same object in
view
Mi ROANE remarked that his colleague had
expiessed a great deal of surprise and astonish-
ment at what he was pleased to consider a wanton
and unprovoked personal assault on him, but he,
himself, had more cause for astonishment, that
his colleague should think proper thus to char-
nctenze the remarks he had just made, and which,
in his opinion, and he would fain believe in the
opinion of every member ot the Senate, were
distinguished by great temper, moderation, and
forbearance After an almost total silence of
nearly two years, while his colleague and him-
self had been in a state of opposition on the most
impoitant questions,he had chosen, at this time,
the most appropriate of all others, to define his
position more clearly, and in doing so it was ne-
cessary for his own vindication, it was due to
then mutual constituents, and to the occasion it-
self, that he should touch upon the course of his
colleague, and point out distinctly and clearlv
where they differed, and the causes of their dif-
ference He declared most solemnly that he had
been governed by no personal feelings whatever,
and that nothing had been said by him that had
not been called for by a solemn though painful
sense of duty.
From motives of the most perfect delicacy he
had hitherto refrained from making the remaiks
that he did, and the restraint he had imposed on
himself had been so strict as to excite in the
mind of his friends some surprise, and perhaps
caused them to misappiehend his motives It
was on this day, foi the fiist time, that he con-
sidered the restraints which delicacy towaids his
colleague had imposed on him wereieleased His
■information left him no reason to doubt the fact
that his colleague had been reelected by a Whig
