Mi Underwood of Kentucky, went mto a statement of the pro-
bable movements ol a stwtm force, its mode of attack as com-
pared with sail vessels, its vast superiority, and urged that
this, new power called for additional force He then spoke of
ti e appropriation for the haibor of New Bedford, and asked if
the committee knew what towns, and their magnitude, *ere
eituaudon this haiboi? They weie Fairhaven and New Bed
ford—towns containing more inhabitants than Boston, in the Re*
volution, wi n more than two hundred ships, an incomparable

Mi ( USHING observed that the gentleman from Kentucky
[Mr Underwood] had every thing that occurred to him by way
of objection to this bill, and had addressed to the committee a
variety of arguments of the former Secretary of War (General
f as ) m opposmon to our niesent mode of fortifying the coun
n>, yet he could not but come at last to the conclusion that the
bill ought to pass He (Mi O ) felt himself bound to notice
some of the remaiks which had fallen fromuth^ gentleman.
Ihe question had been debated year after ysar since he had
been m this House, and debated upon the same punciples, and
the same answers had been made to the objections raised And
what, he woui lask, were the objections of the gentleman from
Kentucky'? Why the first one was, that he wanted more mfbr*
maiK n Well was tins bill not to pass because the gentleman
¡i un Kentucky had not obtained the inforo ation that was con
ti ned m the documents which were within his reach? Was
that u asvnwhj the bill should not pas-s? What was the au-
thoiit) die ¡'enilemaii u ed as against this bill1 Was it nota
i pi rt of il e f m mei Secretary of War, (Gen Cass,) and which
wis exdini ied by a board of ofiiceis commissioned for that
puiposeat t e last se ion of Congress! JSow he would ask
the gentleman whether he had examined the documents com
inunicitedio  Congress bv the Wtr Department on that Bub-
Mr II NDERWOODudid that he had not seen the documents,
but ah he ludalreily remarkt d the fault was his own if ha
had not looked into the subject as much as he ought to have
done
Mr CnSIIING continued The gentleman from Kentucky
almitted that he had not seen the documents which, m fact, met
the precise quebtion, and contained a complete refutation of the
views taken by the foimer Secretary of War, (General Oaes,>
upon whose report the gentleman rested his aigumentagainst
