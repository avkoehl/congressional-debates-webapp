- then undertake to demonsttate hat the spirit oí thia Govern

Mr LINN said before the quesnon for laying the resolution
upon the ub'e was taken, he would sugg st to the Senator from
Ohio the propriety of suspending its  consideration Jor a short
time, andaheungit so as toembtaceoiher matters, and, in par
ticular, an inquiry as to the negotiations growing out of the
Brockville case The facts- of the ca«e were these An Amen

of artillery which was to be conveyed to Ogdensburg The
vessel touched at Biockvilie, ind an officer of thecusomsat
that place went on hoard the vessel and seized the cannon and
detained it, an} refused to restore it to its proper owners. If
the Senator from Ohio would extend his resolution so as to
embrace this subject, he (Mr List*) wou'd venture to predic*
that the correspondence, when furnished to fhem, womd be
found to be of the most extraordinary character It would be
lound by that coirespondence that ihe British Government had
threatened to come into out ternto-y and enforce neutrality,
if we did not do it ourselves He (Mr Lih\) did not think that
the publication of the conespondenee in. both the^e cases
could be atall injurious to the mttre ts ot the Government,
and he would cheerfully support the resolu ion, when the qu"&

Mr ALLEN obseived that his resolution was asking tne

carried on between the two Goveinmpnts In what respect
was the Constitution so impaired that it became necessary foi
the Senate of thf United States to take out of the hands of the
Executive the control of foreign negotiation0'? It was said that
the public interest was not likely to sustain any detriment by
the pubheauon of these negotiations, but independently of the
want ofcoui esy and indelicacy towards theE^ecutive, theie
were abundant reasons why en inquiry of this kind should not
be made at this moment Ihe very natuie of the jemarls
made by the Senator, [Mr Allen ]shows that nothing but mis
chief could arise fioTt it Ihe Senatoi talked of suspension

Mr WOODBURV commenced by stating thaip1 e arguments
advanced m support of one uf these íesolutionfc, that relat ng to
the veto power, struck him wkh surprise The very first
cause set out in the Declaration |f Independence was, that the
King had refused nis assent to la«s deemed wholesome and ne-
cossaiy; but the complaint was alaijjgt a King acting as a ly
rant, independent of the peopie |n/against their interests, and
hadno refeience to an Lxecuti« power of the people them-
selves As ouis was a revolution in hostility to a monarchical
power arrayed against the people, it would be \ery.natural,
at the adoption of the Constitution, that a strongprejndice should
exist, not only against the veto power, but against the whole
Executive power In the Constitutions of the tetates, great
anxiety wis evinced to limit those powers out aftereightyears,
notwithstanding all the suffei ings oi the country,our fathers had
the sagacity and wisdom tu mcorpoiate into The Constitution a
prudent veto power, for tne pe«ple themselves and not others,
and against their delegates and not thernseives Some were in
iavor of raaicrpg it an absolute power, but the mt de now exist-
ing, was finahy adopted All the States then acquiesced and
approved, and after ñf y year^ experience, it is a matter not a
little remarkable that theie has been no propon ion by any
convention of the iiopleor by any Mat  L^Haiurc to abo
hoh or restrict the veto power 1 he me'n g of Whig mem
beis of Congress, convened la&t September, immediately alter
the extra session, was not mcluuedm hn remarks, tor that was
no legislate pow er, nor was u u cor venuon of the people, but
a partial through highly respec able letf illative caucus
Even they, smarting uncer disappointment, did not go the
lengtn of destroying it, foi they admitted, and it has ever since
been admitted, that the exercise of the power is occasionally
wholesome and necessary The most that was intended to be
required by the manifesto party before last June, was that a
voluntary abstinence of the power should be o^JSTved by the
Executive, except to prevent hasty and unconstitutional legis-
lation When has the veto power ever been us°d, except to
a\ ei t hasty and unconstitutional legislation? But an authority
much relied on by tie other side, is that of General Hamgon,
and what did he say? Was he not in favor o! retaining the
veto powei for the same salutary purposes'* In his inaugural
address he says it is a pow^r highly expedient^ and, if usted in
the spir.t of the Constitution, it may be productive of much
good, and be a safeguard of the Union He siid it should be
used first to protect the Constitution from violation, and next
to preventh ¡> yle^ishiion, when the pnnciples of the Consti
tution hive been disiegaidcd oi misurderstoud
APerthis declaiatnn, no latei than Ian March, and the ad
missgions of the Whig Convention last September, it seems
«tiauee that a proposition should now bebiought fui ward and
started in this bjdy to render the powei mopeiative, if nor to
abolish it If the political party which was as zea ous at the
time of giantmg the power as the party which now suppou it,
have changed ihen opinions, wheie i^ the cvilence of that
change^ It was a principle advocated hy the cl impion of
s roí g Governments Hamilun and aie not the gentiemennow

not, foi the half century during which this Government has
been in existence, ac'ed so umioimly m 1 ivur oí a stioug Go
vein ment, as to warrant the a sei tion that, if Jiey held to then
own principles, they would not only support, to its utmost
extent, the present veto power, but, if possible, render it abso
lute? All their leading biatemen and writeis, then and since, arc
strongauthontiesm its favor Butiithe power was light at
the time of itt> adoption m the Constitution, it is aigued ot as
sumed that it is no longer so, becaute the executive power has
been gradually increasing since, until now there is danger of its
absoromg too much power >¡ow he (Mr Woodbury) held
that it was not only right then, but thai nothma had since oc

ecutive power given by tl e Constitution, it v, ould on the eame
pimciples, be good against every other power which controls
la
the majority An argument waff urged by tha Senatot ftom
vir-gmia, [Mr, AHCHER,3that if a power Iilte the teto power be-
came inoperative, or was laid aside, asm England, it might as
well be abolished This, as an abstract principle, might be ad-
mitted, but he denied that any deduction could be drawn from
the premises in favor oi abolishing or restricting a power «oeh
as that of the Executive veto power in use under this Govern-
ment
Mr W then reviewed the examples of the use of the veto
power by the kings of England, and showed how very different
wai the position of a monarch claiming his office by divine
right, and a third estate in the realm,, not impeachable or elec-
tive, comparedwiththeExecutiveof this country,representing
thepeopleand the Sutes, chosen every four years by them, anct
impeaf heable Another great difference was that all the laws
of fingand emanated ougmally from the crown, here they
emanate from the legislative branches of the Government.
From the very nature of out Executive, it is, on this subject!
tied up so as tobe merely aü assenting or dissenting branch!
con rolled by th  whole body of the Legislature and theCon-
s ltution The Executive cannot employ a single sword m the
army, or draw a single cent from the public Treasury, without
the authority of law, and the only power he possesses with re-
gard to those laws which would authorize any interference
with the purse or the sword, is the power of consenting or re-
fusing his assent to laws Even if acts be persisted in by
the legislative branches, to which he has refused his assent, they
may become laws m spite of bis dictent,íwhich shows that he
has no real legislative power To argue, then, that he caa ab
sorb the power of legislation by the exercise of the veto power,
is absurd as little can he control the people. He act  ibr the
people, and by their direction Mr W a Iduced many argu-
ments to show that simple majorities, and no other, are proper
with the people themselves, else there would be no equahty
andindependence
But larger majorities and many checks, requiring the concur-
rence of different bodies, ¿ire necessary restraints on their re-
presentatives, m ordei to secure the people and the^tatee
against their errors The veto controls the delegates of the peo
pie, unless two thirds agree, hut never controls the people them*
selves
Mr W went into various other points and aigumentato
show there was m this no improper or unusual mixture of Ex-
ecutive and legislative powers These arguments will be given
in the full report of his ¡speech
He next contended that Executive power, in its nature, was
m the Constitution more lestricted than the Legislative—more
under check and control, and that all writers and all history
show that in free Governments legislative power increased
faatei than Executive The reverse was true only in monar-
chies, aid theie Mi Dunning s maxim originated. He then
went into the fact, ab to which biancb, the Legislative or Ex-
ecume, had mos increised heie,and showed that the Legis-
lative had actually duren the Executive from this chamber.
But did not the benator see that instead of an increase of Ex-
ecutive power it was a diminution, and an increase af Legis-
lative power, to get rid of his personal influence and personal
solicitation'? Many other changes had been made since the be-
ginning of this Government, and among those, not the least im-
portant was, m legislation, the throwing open of these doors to
the people after thiee oi four yeais, that they, by their pre-
sence, might superintend the action of their representa-
tives
The actof 17S9 m íelation to the revenue, gave control to the
Executive in keeping safely the public muds, but not, as has
been contended, conferring the power of the purse and the
sword, because that power belongs to the power of making ap-
propriations, and raising ai mies and navies But every change
since, from the system of 1789 ongtnated in th growth of le-
gitiht vo power, which is increased by the loaning out, to mem
bcis and fitends, of the public money through the instrumen-
tality of banking institutions Here was an instance of legis-
lative increa&e, which quietly and unhesitatingly gave the
power once, but had since denounced the use ofit,andnaileda
sentence of condemnation on your table against a late Presi-
dent, for merely taking steps to keep safely the public money.
The next is m relation to a Bank oi the United States, resting
on the same basis, and the^e could not be a better illustration
than in the two Bank bills of the last session It was proposed
in those bills to locate the institution here at the seat of Govern
ment Why notin Philadelphia,or New York, where com-
merce and bank business demanded their location? What but
legislative influence—to get the benefit of great interests to
strengthen the legislative branches here'i "What is the effect
of increased tariffs but to increase the legislative power and in
fiuence ovei ihe industry of the country"! What is the result
of grtat ivHcms of intei ral improvement*', but to increase le
