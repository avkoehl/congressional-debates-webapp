By this it will be seen that while these im-
provements were going on, and according to
the gentleman's theory our people were being
" threatened with ruin," they have made im-
provements amounting to nearly three and a
half million dollars in one year!
character 01' pavements.
The gentleman next attacks the character
of the pavements laid in the city, denouncing
them as worthless, and quoting in support of
his denunciation from a report made by the
present commissioner of public works in New
York city, Mr. Van Nort.
As I read the report of that gentleman,
who is discussing wooden and concrete pave-
ments as adapted to use in New York city,
he does not pretead to condemn them gen-
erally. Wooden pavements, he thinks, have
not succeeded in the last ten years, but upon
this -subject experience proves the contrary,
as can be seen in many of the cities of the
Union-
This subject was fully, examined in the in-
vestigation last winter to which I have re-
ferred, and I invite attention particularly to
page 557, testimony of Jonathan Taylor.
As to concrete pavement, Mr. Van Nort
says that he is informed that in many Euro-
pean cities they are well thought of. This
kind of pavement was also fully examined
into last winter by one of the committees of
this House and I .invite attention to the re-
port which was embodied in the testimony,
page 746. It is an elaborate examination of
the subject of concrete pavement, made by
Mr. M. A. Kellogg, engineer in chief depart-
ment of parks, New York; Mr. John Y. Cuy-
ler, chief engineer Brooklyn park commis-
sioner; John-D. Estabrook, principal assist-
ant engineer Fairmount park, Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania; A. B. Mullett, chief engineer
Board of Public Works, District of Columbia ;
S. P. Brown, of theBoardof Public Works of
the District of Columbia. The Committee for
the District also reported upon these pave-
ments favorably.
I invite attention also to the fact that while
Mr. Van Nort sets down the price of concrete
pavement at $3 50 per yard in New York
city, which does not include, as I am informed,
the grading of the street, it is laid by the
board here at $3 20, including two feet of
grading.
Mr. Van Nort puts the cost of wooden
pavement in New York city at five dol-
lars ; it is laid here with prepared wood, in-
cluding the grading as before, for $3 50 per
yard.
Finally, Mr. Speaker, in refutation of the
view presented by the gentleman from New
York, I submit a report made by the advisory
board composed of gentlemen eminent for
scientific attainment as well as for their pub-
lic and private character:
Minutes of a meeting of the advisory hoard of
engineer*, called 15th May, 1872, at Urn o'clock p.
m., at office of Hoard of Public Works, by request
of the Board of Public Works of the District of
Columbia.
Present: General J. K. Barnes, General 0. E.
Babcock, General M. C. Meigs.
The question submitted for opinion of the advis-
ory board is, what preservative process shall the
Board of Public Works adopt in its future use of
wood pavement in the District of Columbia?
The report of chcmical investigation made by
Doctors Tilden and Craig, of the Surgeon General's
Office, of specimens of wood prepared by seventeen
different processes, was read; also, an independent
report by Herman Haupt, civil engineer, on the
same subject, published for the first time in the
May number of the Eclectic Engineering Maga-
zine for the present year.
The opinion of the members present is, that of
the processes examined, that of Seeley gives promise
of best results.
Upon inquiry as to rel ative costof wood and of
bituminous concrete pavemen ts, as now laid in tbe
city of Washington, the board was informed that
the cost of prepared wood pavement is, por square
yard,$3 50: of bituminous concrete pavement, $3 20.
The board recommends that bituminous conorete
pavement be used—the pavements on Vermont
avenue in front of the Arlington hotel, on Fifteenth
street west,, and Scott square, and on G street north,
between Fourteenth and Fifteenth streets west,
being made the standard, and that wood pavements
bo laid only where existing contracts, or some other
exceptional reason, demands them. The bituminous
I concrete pavement gives promise of greater dura-
bility, and it is much easier on horses, carriages,
and riders. The board adjourned.

struggles of the district government.
Mr. Speaker, I must not conclude my re-
marks without calling attention to some of the
difficulties with which our District government
has had to contend since its establishment.
The organic act passed February 21, 1871. By
its provisions the old government .expired June
1,1871. Early in March the officers appointed
under the act qualified, and steps were taken
to convene the Legislature in order that pro-
vision should be made against any interregnum
in our government. The election was held in
May, when a Delegate to Congress was chosen
and the members of the lower house of the
Legislative Assembly.
It had become generally known to the com-
munity that the Board of Public Works con-
templated extensive improvements, and their
views were quite well understood and entered
largely into the contest. The struggle was
really then, as it has been since, between
those in the District who prefer that we
should not attempt any sudden change in our
policy as to improvements, but rather that we
should plod along in the old-fashioned way, and
those more enterprising spirits who were de-
termined that there should be a new departure
with regard to beautifying and improving the
city. The result was a majority of over -four
thousand on the general ticket, and the elec-
tion of a large majority to the lower house in
favor of improvements.
