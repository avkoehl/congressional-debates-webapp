building, it was said to he intended for the accom-
modation of the Post Office Department And
surely such an object could not have been contem-
plated by Gene'al Jackson in July, 1836 At that
time no want existed of such accommodation.
The Post Office Department had then a convenient
and a piopnate building, and it was months after
when a ■> cofuiagration which cau ed its destruction
«euid have randered any thought of this further
provision proper Sir, there must be some mistake
in this maltei In the very loo^e and indefinite
terms of the commission given to the architect
may be found the source ot much oí the present
difficulty He is there authorized "to aid in form-
ing tne plans, maling propci changes therein, Jioin
time to tune," and these changes it is that lay at the
foundation of all the mischief. It was this au-
thomy which has substituted for the simple, neat,
conveme-n, and economical plan of Mr Elliot,
which hid been appioved by the committee, the
complex, ornate, incongruous, and extravagant de-
s gn of the present architect, which, instead of
jmpmvin<3 a b?d site by the judie ous position of
an aporopnate edifice, has added to the mconve
menee oí pl?ce by the faulty arrangement of an
ímpeifcrtand unauthoir/ed structure
Mr Chairman, lest I should be thought to press
this point ol objection beyond the degree ot consi-
deration to wh en it may be entitled, I beg leave to
lefei to a document which has not before come to
(he notice of the committee, to show that the des ¿u
oí the building, and consequently the expense in-
volve 1 in it completion, is not even now under-
shot) ¡bv the Government In a communication

now open at both ends, more nearly resembling the

A repoit f'om the architect to the President is
the authority tor the understanding that ' Ihe phn
ot the bu Iding admits of its being completed with
oi without wings" Mr Chairman, I much fear
that he confidence of the President has been
abused m Ihi matter Sir, the plan of the butld
nigs is of a fit Idtng with wings, and the plan can-
not be txtc t d without them The mam en-
lia^cts > nu' i c therw ice be cut off, and m no way
che can the ems of the building now be finish d,
\ ihout violating every rule of architectural order
Your committee repeatedly and carefully inquired
into this subject, and I feel well assured that there
can hff pn completion of the present parts of the
bml >i°, 'ro harmony of the original design," but
with the addition of the wings. This misappre-
hension of the President is the assigned cause, too,
why ' it is nof t wught that the public interest re-
quires any change m the location or plan" It
may be fair to infer that, with more correct in-
formation from the architect, his conc'usion would
h ive bp'n d ffeient m this respect also
I have thus endeavored to show that the inten-
tion, of Cc "gress in regard to the passage of the
law have nt t been regarded, either in the designa-
tion ot the *i e by the President foi the precise lo-
cation of the building, or the selection by him of
the definite pl?ns for its construction, but that the
architect, availing himself of the opportunity which
the absence or sickness of the late Chief Magis-
trate afforded, and  under a misapprehension of
facts induced in the mud of his successor, has
substituted the dictates of his own judgment, or
taste, or interest, both in the design and the location
of the edifice The work derives n« sanction from
the authority which was to direct to its construction,
and the consideration ot its defects, whatever they
may be, is disembarrassed of all other reference
than to their intrinsic character
It was, Mr Chairman, irom the unsatisfactory
result of then own observations, that the Commit-
tee on Public Buildings proposed to the Piesident
to be permitted to call to their aid the advice of some
skilful, experienced, and unprejudiced artist Their
application w as promptly responded to, and, by the
appointment of the President, Thomas IT Walter,
esj an architect of high and deserved celebrity,
then and now in charge of the construction of the
Girard College, in the City of Philadelphia, one of
the most costly and magnificent structures which
ever adorned any age or nation, was engaged in
their sei vice The report of this gentleman is upon
the desks of members, ami to ihe opinions which it
expresses I snail advert hereafter.
The survey and examination by Mi. Walter
having resulted unfavoiabl) to the character of the
work, the committee, wiih a scrupulous regard lo
the feelings and mteitst of the architect of ihe
building, submitted to him a copy ot the leport,
and invited an answer to the objections it conlam
ed That answer is also given to the House It
could be matter o( no suipnse that there should
thus be exhibited a conflict of opinions, the almost
necessary consequence of diveisity of taste or judg-
ment, or ol varied practice and experience, influ-
enced, too, on the one side by ths pride of previous
opinion and of d°ep per onal interest In the spirit
ot impartiality and of anxious inquiry after truth,
recourse was again had to the authority of the Pre-
sident to call to the assistance of the committee ano-
thei well-qualiOd, unbiassed, and uiipiejudicul
witness and judge of the work In the report of
Mr Parris, appended to the printed report of the
committee, we hate the opinion of an architect to
whose science, eminent skill, and large experience
m his piofession, the highest testimoniáis were of-
fered, and whose judgment in the matter it will ill
become less instructed and competent men to resist
That judgmtnt is in accoidance with the report of
Mr Walter, and condemns the structure, in its de-
sign and progress, from the very inception of the
plan to its piesent point of execution
Mr Chairman, it has been the occupation and
the duty of some port on r f my life to consider Ihe
character of human testimony, to analyze, compare,
and weigh iact= and circumstances, and to aruve
at conclusions from the prevailing power and force
of evidence The situation of witnesses is no in-
considerable element in the credit which should be
given to their testimony On the subject under dis-
cussion, we have, on the one hand, the confident
assurance of tbP architect of the building in the fit-
ness and thoroughness of the work, and, on the
other, the impeachment, by two artists, both of the
plan and exicution
I have 1 efoie refeired to the different positions in
which these gentlem n stand to the subject, the one
implicated in his conduct, his professional reputa-
tion involved, and the continuance of his employ-
ment here, perhaps, depending upon the issue of
this investigation, the others involuntarily brought
from a distance to an examination of the work, pre-
viously unapprised of its supposed defects, uncom-
mitted by the expression of any previous opinion,
and to be affected by no possible resulf The pre-
ponderating claim to confidence might well be de-
termined from these considerations alone. But
theie are other circumstances which are proper to
be brought to view in this connection The archi-
tect of the building, in his report to the committee,
challenges what he is pleased to term the them y of
the other artists against his long and successful prac-
tice, and, in support of the latter, points "to nu-
merous fire-proof buildings erected by me" inSoutii
Carolina, and to "some of the custom-house  de-
signed by me, and erected within the last five or six
years m New England," particularly at Newbur}-
port and New Bedford, in. Massachusetts, and New
London and Middletown, Connection'  n') to "the
custom-house stores in Baltimore, now uu ei con-
struction, and designed  by  me  as a fire-proof
building."
Mr. Chairman, m respect to his claims to merit
for the design of the custom-house stores in Balti-
more, I beg to have read a lettei from the archi-
tect employed m the erection of that building, ad-
dressed to an honorable member of this House,
which I send to the table.

lOIIN I    HOSS
Mr Chairman, I apprehend that, upon inquiry,
the architect will be found scarcely more meritori-
ous in relation to some of the buildings to which
he has called the attention of the committee, as
tZcsi^ncfZ by him, anel erected m New England If,
by ihe use of the e terms, he intends only that he
furnished plans and drawings ft r such buildings,
or, in respect to some of them, that he dnected the
mode of construction and order of woil , I have no
authority to gainsay the expression , but that, in
any other sense, he erected or de igned the buildings,
or, in regal d to some of them, knows even in what
manner they were executed, I may be permitted to
doubt. In one thing, at least, he is, as I am in-
formed, greatly mistaken lie claims that, at the
time of his engagement upon the custom-houses m
Massachusetts, he " found not a single bricklayer
that knew how to turn a grom ," and that " up to
that day, such a thing as a brick-groin was not to
be found m New England " Sir, against this
pretension of vanity, it has been stated to me, from
a source not to be questioned, that long befóte Mr.
Mills ever saw New England, or had himself
" turned a grom," the Massachusetts General
Hospital, m Boston, one of the noblest stiuctures
m that beautiful city abounding in public edifices
of the most approved models, had been constructed
in its basement «tory upon precisely the same pnn-
ciple of arching , and that the practice was there
well understood and familiar to mechanics The
fact imports but little of itself, but may serve to
disabuse the public mind of false confidence in the
genius and experience of the architect
And here I gladly dismiss both ths Architect of
the Public Buildings and his report to the commit-
tee from further consideration It seemed to me
necessary to have bestowed upon them thus much
particularity of attention, as upon the degree of
credit lo which they are entitled may, in a great
degree, depend the disposition of the subject-matter
under discussion Sir, I again repeat, that, in what
I have said, I indulge m no unkind fueling towards
the individual It is to the merits of his work of
construction, to his capacity and fidelity m the ser-
vice in which he has been engaged, and to the effect
of his labors upon the public interest, to these, and
to these alone, as brought to the view of the commit-
tee, within the scope of their duty to the House
and to the country, that I have directed my re-
marks.   I now pass to the provisions of the bill
