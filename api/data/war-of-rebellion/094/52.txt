Major General GEORGE STONEMAN,

Knoxville, Tenn.:

Richmond papers admit that Sherman will reach the sea-coats; he crossed the Oconee River some days ago. Great fears are expressed for the safety of Savannah. It is reported that Sherman captured Millen, on the Georgia Central Railroad, on the 29th ultimo. All quiet around Richmond. No heavy fighting near nashville since the battle at Franklin. There are rumors that Hood is trying to cross the Cumberland River.
