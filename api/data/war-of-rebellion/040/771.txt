James River. Movements beyond there I know nothing of. It is likely they will cross James River, if possible.

Captain, Commanding.

GORDONSVILLE, VA., May 3, 1863.

General ELZEY:

I think the enemy are moving toward Columbia. I am moving. I think they will strike for the Lynchburg and Richmond [Railroad.]

[Brigadier-General.]

GORDONSVILLE, VA., May 3, 1863.

General ELZEY:

The enemy has left the railroad, and are making their way toward James River or Charlottesville. Look out for the canal.

Brigadier-General.

OFFICE VIRGINIA CENTRAL RAILROAD COMPANY, Richmond, Va.,

May 3, 1863-3 o'clock.

[General ELZEY:]

GENERAL: Our reconnoitering engine has returned to Beaver Dam, and is now on the way to Junction. They met an advanced guard near Frederick's Hall, and fired on them, having a small force along of 18 men. An imperfect report states that the enemy (2,000 strong) were still tearing up the road, and said they would visit Beaver Dam. It seems that the larger part of the force was left at Louisa Court-House, and that is the party which General Lee referred to in his dispatch this morning. I shall have fuller information in a short time. The train took on 49 prisoners at Beaver Dam who were captured at Spotsylvania Court-House. The train will also take on 200 sick at Junction, and I wish to know whether I can bring this train to Richmond before the troops will be ready to leave. I can have it here by 6 o'clock.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. D. WHITCOMB,

General Superintendent.

WAR DEPARTMENT, C. S. A., Richmond, May 3, 1863.

General WADE HAMPTON,

Lynchburg, Va.:

Besides the advance on Columbia, detachments of the enemy are reported to be advancing by two roads toward Richmond, from 12 to 17 miles distant.

J. A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War.
