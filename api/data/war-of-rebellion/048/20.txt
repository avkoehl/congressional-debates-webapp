Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. G. MEADE,

Brigadier General LORENZO THOMAS,

Adjutant-General, U. S. Army.

DECEMBER 8, 1863-8 p. m.

Major S. F. BARSTOW,

Care of Major S. Breck, Asst. Adjt. General:

MAJOR: General Meade desires that you will make the following changes in his report: Where he mentions Birney's division as relieving Carr's, strike out the words, "and evidently, from the reports, bore the brunt of the engagement," and change the word "his," after "advancing," a little further on in the narrative, into "its." The report will then read: Birney's division formed in rear of Carr's, soon relieved the latter, repulsing all the attacks," &amp;c., and "advancing its line of skirmishers," &c. These changes come about midway of the report.

Please acknowledge this.

S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
