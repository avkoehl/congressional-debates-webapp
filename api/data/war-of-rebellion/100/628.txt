Northern District, Department of the South:

GENERAL: Troops have been sent to me from the North, and I shall be able to send you a force for the district north of the Santee and Wateree Rivers. You need not, therefore, until further orders, send General Hartwell there, as suggested in my other letter of this date. I desire you to select seveal reliable chaplains and send them into the interior. Call meetings among the planters and colored people for the puropose of instructing both classes in their duties to themselves, to their country, and to each other under the new order of things.

I deem this measure of great importance.
