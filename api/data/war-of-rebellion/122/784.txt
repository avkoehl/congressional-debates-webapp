STATE OF DELAWARE, EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT,

Dover, Del., January 8, 1862.

Adjt. General L. THOMAS:

SIR: I am directed by the Governor to acknowledge the receipt by him of your letter of the 4th instant requesting information to be forwarded to your office in relation to the regiments furnished by this State to the General Government. The Governor desires me to say in reply that he would cheerfully furnish the desired information were it in his power to do so, but the Governor has no official knowledge of any of the matters inquired of. There are two regiments which have been formed by volunteer companies which have elected their officers and been mustered into service of the United States by an officer of the General Government. But whether these regiments are complete, or of the number of companies in each, or of the kind of arms used, or of their efficient strength, the Governor is entirely ignorant. He has heard, but cannot say whether it be correct or not, that another regiment is now being formed; but of this he knows nothing, never having had any official notice of it. The colonel of the First Delaware Regiment is John W. Andrew, who is stationed with his regiment at Fort Monroe. The colonel of the Second Delaware Regiment is Henry W. Wharton, who is stationed with his regiment near Drummondtown, Va. A letter to these gentlemen would probably furnish you with the strength and condition of each regiment. As to the Third Delaware Regiment, if indeed such an one is being formed, the Governor knows nothing.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

EDWARD RIDGELY,

Secretary of State.
