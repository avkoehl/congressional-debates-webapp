HDQRS. SECOND Brigadier, SECOND DIV., 14TH ARMY CORPS,June 18, 1864.

[Captain T. W. MORRISON:]

CAPTAIN: At 3.30 o'clock I ordered the picket officer in charge to feel for the enemy; he did so and has gone half a mile or three-quarters into their works; there are no signs of them. We lost 2 men last night in advancing the picket-line.

Your obedient servant,

JNO. G. MITCHELL,

Colonel, Commanding Second Brigadier, Second Div., 14th Army Corps.

[Indorsement.]

Respectfully referred to corps headquarters for information.

I have sent out a regiment to feel for them.

JEFF. C. DAVIS,

Brigadier-General.
HDQRS. FIRST DIVISION, TWENTIETH ARMY CORPS,DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,

June 18, 1864.

Lieutenant Colonel H. W. PERKINS,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: Colonel Hawley, my division officer of the day, reports but little firing in our front. The pickets of Fourth Corps have been advanced about 400 yards, ours still connecting with them. The heavy firing in front of Fourth Corps was caused by the advance named.

I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,

A. S. WILLIAMS,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST DIVISION CAVALRY,June 18, 1864-12.45 p. m.

General W. L. ELLIOTT,

Chief of Cavalry:

GENERAL: I inclose a map* of the roads I spoke of leading from this point. The map is correct. Some of the enemy's infantry pickets were at the bridge on Noyes' Creek yesterday evening. Then cavalry made their appearance at one or two points on my picket-line this morning, but did not attempt to attack. I have heard nothing from the Second Brigade which went in pursuit of that party toward Allatoona yesterday. Nothing new except that citizens report officers told them that Johnston's command crossing the river yesterday morning. Allatoona, the creek we crossed to reach here, swims a horse. We can get nothing over.

E. M. McCOOK,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
