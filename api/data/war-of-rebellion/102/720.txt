them quarters in the old camps here, but I do not conceive that I have authority to issue rations to them, since they do not seem to come properly under the head of refugees and freedmen. I respectfully request that immediate instructions be given me on this point. It is hardly possible for many of these people to get along without assistance from some source. The depth of water in Alexandria is from four to eight feet, and the whole country in its rear is, or will be, flooded. Many of the people, both from the town and country, are crossing to this side.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ORRIN McFADDEN,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding.
