HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, near Atlanta, August 14, 1864.

General THOMAS:

The telegraph has just announced the capture, by the rebel cavalry, of a drove of 1,000 cattle about Adairsville. Let General McCook have a determined pursuit and General Garrard a brigade ready to push across to and beyond Canton, to prevent the driving away of these cattle.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, near Atlanta, August 14, 1864.

General THOMAS:

We should either act offensively with our cavalry or so place it that it catch Wheeler on his return. Let General Elliott give orders that those cattle must be recovered at all hazards, and we will await further news as to the force Wheeler carried off with him; but Generals Garrard's and Kilpatrick's cavalry could operate in the absence of Wheeler from Decatur without risk.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,August 14, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN:

Your dispatch received and shown to Elliott. He will be over to see you. But do you think it prudent to risk my more cavalry on their communications until our force is materially increased?

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, near Atlanta, August 14, 1864.

General THOMAS:

General Elliott is here. Inasmuch as we propose to throw the bulk of our army on the enemy's communications I will not risk our cavalry, but will get General Elliott to have General Kilpatrick make a bold reconnaissance toward Fairburn and engage any cavalry he meets to test its strength; General Schofield's cavalry to go with him.
