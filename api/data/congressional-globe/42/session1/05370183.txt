APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
183
42d Cong.... 1st Sess.
Fourteenth Amendment—Mr. Piatt.
Ho. of Reps.
by the Constitution in its amended form, that
I am amazed to hear gentlemen whom I must
believe honest and conscientious in their views,
deny that under our form of government any
such constitutional power exists. I believe,
and have always been taught to believe, that
Governments are instituted among men prin-
cipally for the purpose of protecting life, lib-
erty, and property, and that when a Govern-
ment fails to do this for its humblest citizen at
home or abroad, it fails to perform its first and
most important duty. Should any Government
voluntarily confess its inability to so protect
its citizens it would be a confession of weak-
ness, justly subjecting it to the contempt of
other Governments; and it seems to me that
the real issue involved in this discussion, and
the most important one to our future welfare
as a self-governing people and our history as
a nation, is the decision of the question as to
whether this Republic has power to protect
the lives, liberty, and property of its own cit-
izens at home in a time of peace. That we
have this power to protect our citizens abroad,
no patriotic citizen doubts.
I presume this power will not be questioned
by the gentlemen on the other side representing
the Democratic party in this discussion, but
strangely enough they do deny the power to
protect our own citizens on our own soil.
They found enough power in the Constitution
to compel every man in every State in the
Union to assist in enforcing the United States
laws made in the interest of the Democratic
party, and compelling them by United States
law and in defiance of State laws to assist in
returning fugitives to slavery, but can find no
warrant in that instrument;, even as amended,
to keep the men at whose bidding these laws
were passed, the men who then owned the
Democratic party and are fast getting to own
it again, from hanging, shooting, beating,
maiming, and burning the poor freedmen who
were then their slaves, but now, by the grace of
God and the Republican party, free American
citizens. In those days it was constitutional
in the eyes of the Democratic party for the
United States authorities to enforce United
States laws, but now they tell us-that we must
permit the terrible outrages that are being per-
petrated daily upon our friends in the southern
States to continue without an effort on our
part to protect them.
We are told that the State itself must deal
with this class of cases, and that by and under
the Constitution it is only when the State au-
thorities call upon the General Government
for aid in enforcing the laws that it can inter-
fere; that when these State authorities are in
complicity with the criminals, aiding aud abet-
ting their lawless violence and of course refus-
ing to call for assistance from the General Gov-
ernment, that even then there is no legal and
constitutional power by which the United States
authorities can interpose to protect its citizens.
Mr. Speaker, such an attempted interpretation
of the law, such an assumption, is an insult to
the American people, an insult to the million
brave veterans who periled life and limb to
preserve the Union, to the hundreds of thou-
sands of noble spirits who yielded up their
lives and died that their country might live,
that Union and that country which are not
worth saving unless they do possess the power
to protect the men who fought for their sal-
vation. But notwithstanding these labored
arguments to the contrary I do not believe there
can be any serious doubt of the power of this
Congress to legally and constitutionally dele-
gate powers to the President to use all the
resources of the Government to stop these
outrages.
Is there any one who believes that were this
thing reversed, and these outrages which are
being committed upon the friends of the Ad-
ministration in the southern States were com-
mitted by Republicans upon Democrats in
Democratic States—with a Democratic ma-
jority in both branches of Congress, a Demo-
cratic President, and an army and navy in
their hands—that a Democratic Congress would
fail to find constitutional warrant for extend-
ing protection to their friends, although the
State authorities, through weakness, treachery,
or cowardice, should fail to call for assistance
from the General Government? The whole
history of that party forbids such a supposi-
tion ; and in their days of power they gave us
a precedent which is sufficient justification to
me for the votes I shall give on this bill and
such amendments as may be offered. Is there
any gentleman on the Democratic side of this
House who is willing to admit that the fugitive
slave law of 1850 was unconstitutional? I do
not believe there is; and as one Republican
member from the South, I am willing to take
that law—and changing its wording somewhat,
so as to make the rights and privileges to be
protected those of loyal men and free Amer-
ican citizens, instead of those of slave-own-
ers—and find in it all the protection which as
loyal citizens of the South we demand from
the Government which owes us the fullest pro-
tection its laws can extend.
The constitutionality of such a law could not
be questioned, for it was affirmed in 1850 by
the entire Democratic party and by the united
and solid vote of that party on this floor, forced
through this House under the operation of the
previous question, no opportunity for debate
or amendment beiug permitted by the then
Democratic majority. Its constitutionality was
maintained and defended by the party that
enacted it as long as they continued in power,
and affirmed again and again by the United
States courts, then presided over by Demo-
cratic judges. I desire to call the attention
of the House to the remarkable provisions of
this constitutional Democratic law, this act
entitled "An act to amend," &c., commonly
known as'' the fugitive slave law, "which passed
in this House in September, 1850, having pre-
viously passed in the Senate. Its first section
provides for the appointment of commission:
ers by the circuit courts to execute the powers
and duties prescribed by the act. Section
three provides that the number of these com-
missioners should be extended, at the discre-
tion of the court, and any number appointed
that might be deemed necessary in carrying
out the provisions of the act.
Section four confers such remarkable and
extraordinary powers upon these commission-
ers that I quote it in full:
"And be it further enacted. That the commissioners
above named sballhave concurrent jurisdiction with
the judges of the circuit and district courts of the
United States in their respective circuits and dis-
tricts within the several States and the judges of the
superior courts of the Territories, severally and col-
lectively, in term time and vacation, and shall
grant certificates to such claimants upon satisfactory
proof being made, with authority to take and remove
such fugitives from service or labor to the State or
Territory from which such persons may have escaped
or fled."
Section five prescribes the duties of mar-
shals who may have any number of deputies,
and prescribes penalties should they refuse
to obey or execute all warrants or precepts
issued under the provisions of this act when to
them directed, makes them liable to the full
value of any slave that may escape from their
custody after arrest, and in language which I
will give as it appears'in the section confers
still more remarkable powers upon the com-
missioners. [ quote from the section :
"And the better to enable thesaid commissioners,
when thus appointed, to executo their duties faith-
fully aud efficiently in conformity with the require-
ments of the Constitution of the United States, and
of this act, they are hereby authorised and empow-
ered, within their counties-respectively, to appoint
in writing, under tbeir hauds, any one or more suit-
able persons, from time to time, to execute all such
warrants and other process as may be issued by th em
in the lawful performance of their respective duties,
with authority to such commissioners, or the par-
sons to be appointed by them, to execute process as
aforesaid, to summon and call to their aid the by-
standers or posse carmtatus of the proper county, when
necessary, to insure a faithful observance of the pro-
visions of this act; and all good citizens are hereby
commanded to aid and assist in the profcnpt and effi-
cient execution of this law, whenever their services
may be required, as aforesaid, for that purpose, and
said warrants shall run and be executed bysaidoffi-
cers, anywhere in the State within which they ara
issued."
Section seven imposesfine and imprisonment
on any person who shall willingly hinder the
arrest of a fugitive or shall attempt to rescue
one from custody or harbor or aid to escape
any fugitive from slavery.
Section nine provides that when the claim-
ant or his agent apprehend a rescue the officer
making the arrest is to remove the fugitive to
the State from whence he fled or to employ as
many persons in doing so as he may consider
necessary, all the expenses to be paid by the
United States.
Now, sir, having quoted as much of this act
as I cousider necessary to my purpose, let us
see how easily it can be adapted to the present
condition of affairs and meet the requirements
of the loyal men of the South: simply by so
altering the text as to make its provisions apply
to the prevention of outrages against life and
property, instead of to the catching and render-
ing up of fugitive slaves.
Under its provisions the United States cir-
cuit courts could appoint as many commis-
sioners as they pleased to appoint in every
county in their respective districts, and these
commissioners could in turn commission as
many men as they deemed necessary to exe-
cute their warrants, would have all the powers
of the circuit or district judges in term time
or vacation, could issue their warrants for
the arrest of any citizen, and the warrants
would be good in any portion of the State,
could summons every man in the county to-
assist in serving their processes, and if any
refused to obey their mandate, could fine and
imprison them for so doing, could include in
that posse comitatus such portion of the Uni-
ted States forces—the Army and Navy of the
United States—as might be within the terri-
tory over which they exercised jurisdiction,
and would possess powers more than ample
to secure peace and the most perfect protec-
tion to life, liberty, and property in every State
in the Union ; and the constitutional power
of Congress to confer these powers cannot be
do ubted, for has not the party whose Repre-
sentatives on this floor have so often assured us
of their devotion to the Constitution, stamped
the seal of approval upon all its provisions,
enacted into lawaliits principles, and enforced
and maintained that law by all the machinery
of the Government? And the Democratic
party, having enacted this law and sustained
its constitutionality before the adoption of the
amendments to the Constitution which have
certainly conferred some new powers upon
Congress, cannot, I presume will not, attempt
to question its constitutionality now.
It was good Democratic constitutional law
to empower an unlimited number of compara-
tively irresponsible United States marshals to
use the Army and Navy of the United States
to enforce United States laws when those laws
were in the interest of the Democratic parly ;
and now, sir, we witness the remarkable spec-
tacle of this party, which conferred such
powers upon these men with no apprehension
of injury to State governments, with no fears
as to any destruction of our liberties, with no
doubts as to their entire constitutionality,
now boldly denying that, this Congress has any
constitutional right to give, the President of
the United States power to use the Army and
Navy, of which he is the constitutional Com-
matider-m-Chief, in protecting American citi-
zens from outrage and death ; the party whoj
