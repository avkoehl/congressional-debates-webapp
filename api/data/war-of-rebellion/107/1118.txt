Brigadier-General CRAWFORD,

Commanding Third Division:

GENERAL: In a short time, say three-quarters of an hour, the line will move to the front. In the first line two brigades of the First Division will be on right, resting on the railroad, one brigade of Ayres connecting with Bartlett on the same line and one brigade of Crawford on the same line connecting with Ayres. The second line will be composed of the other brigaes of the three divisions, and be about 400 yards in rear. Three batteries will move in rear of the First Division and three in rear of the Third, all ready to move to the front when wanted. The lines will be governed in their movement from the right. The battalions will move forward in division columns, ready to deploy before coming under fire. Division commanders must themselves judge of the time to make the deployment. Silence, regularity, and absence of confusion must be preserved. A bugle sounded from the right and taken up by the other commands will be the signal for the advance.

GEO. SYKES,

Major-General, Commanding.

(Same to General Ayres and Bartlett.)

General HUMPHREYS:

GENERAL: Norman's Ford is understood to be within easy renge of the bridge opposite the lower corssing, and though bridge may be thrown under cover of darkness, it is doubtful whetewer troops can cross while the enemy holds the ridge. If we can drive him from the works opposite us we can cross near the upper crossing under cover.
