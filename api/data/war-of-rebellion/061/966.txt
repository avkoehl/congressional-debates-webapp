HDQRS. BATT., EIGHTH MISSOURI MILITIA CAVALRY,Neosho, Mo., June 3, 1864.

GENERAL: This morning at about 8 o'clock 20 bushwhackers ran on 2 men of Company L, 3 miles from this place, killing 1 and capturing the other (Sergeant Ruark). I immediately started out a scout of 30 men under Captain Ruark, who overtook the rebels about 9 or 10 miles from here. The captain as soon as he came in sight of the rebels ordered his men to charge. After the fight was over 4 bushwhackers were found dead on the ground. Lieutenant Smith, of Company M, was pursuing a bushwhacker closely, who turned and shot the lieutenant through the head, killing him instantly. Sergeant Ruark was released, and his life no doubt saved by this speedy pursuit.

Your obedient servant,

H. D. MOORE,

Captain, Commanding Post.
