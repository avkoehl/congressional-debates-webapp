So soon as I shall have verified the condition of the army-perhaps to-day-I will assume command of it.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN A. McCLERNAND,

Major-General, Commanding.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington, January 4, 1863.

Major-General GRANT,

Holly Springs, Miss.:

A paper purporting to be General Orders, Numbers 11, issued by you December 17, has been presented here. By its terms it expels all Jews from your department. If such an order has been issued, it will be immediately revoked.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.

HOLLY SPRING, MISS., January 4, 1863.

NAVAL COMMANDER CAIRO, ILL.:

Some light-draught gunboats now in the Tennessee River would be of great value. Forrest has gone to the east bank, but there are strong signs of him recrossing in the vicinity of Savannah. Can any be sent?

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE TENNESSEE,Holly Springs, Miss., January 4, 1863.

Brigadier General GRENVILLE M. DODGE, Corinth, Miss.:

I am not informed that the force at Pontotoc is yet moving; think it is not. If I ascertained there is a combined movement of Roddey's forces and the force said to be at Pontotoc I will send a division to you. If I learn, as it is now reported that Vicksburg is ours, I can send you a division any way. My latest advices from Vicksburg direct are of the 29th. There had then been desperate fighting. Sherman had lost about 3,000 men, killed and wounded, but had carried the enemy's rifle-pits, and one fort of nine guns. I hear from a citizen that the Grenada Appeal of the 31st says that the Yankees had possession of Vicksburg.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.

LA GRANGE, January 4, 1863.

General GRANT:

I am told to-day that Morgan, of Kentucky, had united his cavalry with Van Dorn, and was with him at Holly Springs. I have no doubt it was so, and that he is with him again.

C. S. HAMILTON.
