General GARFIELD, Chief of Staff:

Yesterday morning, being very unwell, I asked General Granger to relieve me for a few days, stating, in the same dispatch, if he could not I would hold up. Van Derveer came and assumed command at noon, but still I had all the work to do. To-day some better, and have done all the fighting. Nothing has been done except by me. To-nigh I received the following order from Granger:
