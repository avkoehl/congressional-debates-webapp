engaged from John's Island. General Gilmer is still too much an invalid from his eyes to take the field; moreover, he is much needed at Savannah, where he commands District of Georgia and Third Military District of South Carolina. General Finegan seems to be doing very well at present in Middle Florida. I will go there in person, if necessary, soon as enemy shall be more quiet in my front.

Brigadier General H. A. WISE,

John's Island, S. C.:

I congratulate you and the troops on your success. Keep Colquitt's brigade until you shall have ended to pursuit; he will then return to Rantowles on his way to Savannah. A stem-boat awaits your orders at Fort Pemberton. On account of torpedoes it cannot go much below.

Brigadier General H. A. WISE,

John's Island, S. C.:

It is doubtful, after repulse of yesterday, if you can draw enemy into ambuscade. You may have to attack him boldly. Telegraph to General Taliaferro for some siege guns, including 30-pounder Parrotts, if you require them. They could cross from or near Fort Pemberton.

G. T. BEAUREGARD.

CHARLESTON, S. C., February 12, 1864.

Brigadier General W. B. TALIAFERRO,

Royall's, James Island:

The Twenty-first South Carolina Volunteers will not go by boat. It will march.

By command of General Beauregard:

JNO. M. OTEY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

ROYALL'S HOUSE, February 12, 1864.

Captain J. M. OTEY:

Major Jenkins reports that the enemy evacuated John's Island last night. I had the Twenty-first [South Carolina] Regiment continue its march to that island. Please answer.

WM. B. TALIAFERRO,

Brigadier-General.
