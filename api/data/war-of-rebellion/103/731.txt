Major B. H. POLK,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

A lieutenant, a deserter from the Eleventh Tennessee Cavalry, left Forrest's headquarters, at Verona, Miss., Saturday. He was then making his arrangements to move his headquarters to Macon, Ga. Cheatham and Steward have certainly gone to South Carolina, and he thinks Lee has gone also. Dick Taylor has only 12,000 men left out of 42,000 that Hood brought into Tennessee. Great demoralization and many are deserting.
