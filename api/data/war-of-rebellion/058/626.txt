experience is the cavalry will bear a favorable comparison. I regret to state that there are many irregularities in my command, as in all others.

Major-General.

HDQRS. DEPARTMENT OF ALA., MISS., AND EAST LA.,Meridian, Miss., May 29, 1864.

Respectfully forwarded.

It is impossible to obtain any more definite information with reference to the irregularities complained of than is given within. Colonel Logan is not now in this department, and his former command has been broken up.

For Major-General Lee:

WILLIAM ELLIOTT,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

ADJUTANT AND INSPECTOR GENERAL'S OFFICE,

Respectfully submitted to the Secretary of War.

H. L. CLAY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

[Indorsement Numbers 16.]

JUNE 18, 1864.

ADJUTANT-GENERAL:

Like most of the returns upon complaints like this the report is very unsatisfactory.

The fact is notorious that the cavalry in Mississippi in general have been lawless and rapacious in their dealings with the property of citizens, and that a careful and considerate regard for their rights is a rare occurrence in the government of that arm of the service. It is too mild a term to call the acts done there mere venial irregularities.

The commanding general should apply every means in his control toward effecting a radical reform in the condition of things in that State.

By order:

J. A. CAMPBELL,

Assistant Secretary of War.
HEADQUARTERS,Selma, Ala., January 27, 1864.

Colonel THOMAS M. JACK,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Meridian, Miss.:

COLONEL: I have this morning had an interview with Dr. E. L. Antony, an old and respectable citizen of Huntsville, Ala. (well known here as one of our most loyal men), who informs me that the enemy design an early raid on this point.
