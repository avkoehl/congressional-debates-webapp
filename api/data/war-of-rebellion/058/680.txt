Colonel MCCULLOCH,

Commanding Brigade, Mitchell's Cross-Roads:

COLONEL: The brigadier-general commanding directs that you throw out scouts over to the front to observe the movements of the enemy, keeping the main body of your command as much concealed as possible. If you find that the enemy have only one brigade, and they attempt to cross Coldwater, you will allow them to do so, concealing your own force and attacking them in the bottom between the river and the hills. Send information here at once of any movements by the enemy, and re-enforcements will be sent to you. You will keep four days' cooked rations constantly on hand, and the men will have 40 rounds of ammunition in their cartridge-boxes and 40 in the ordnance wagons, if possible. General Forrest has ordered Kizer's and Franklin's battalions to report to him. You will retain all their transportation.

Your obedient servant,

W. A. GOODMAN,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
