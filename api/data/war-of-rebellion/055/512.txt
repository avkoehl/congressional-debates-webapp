Report of Brigadier General John B. Turchin, U. S. Army, commanding First Brigade.
HDQRS. FIRST BRIG., THIRD DIV., 14TH ARMY CORPS,Chattanooga, Tennessee, November 30, 1863.

SIR: On the 23rd of November, I received orders from the general commanding the division to move my brigade, consisting of the Eleventh, Seventeenth, Thirty-first, Thirty-sixth, Eighty-ninth, and Ninety-second Ohio, and Eighty-second Indiana Volunteer Infantry, and take position in front of the fortifications in two lines, the right resting on the Rossville road, the whole division forming an oblique line with the Fourth Army Corps, then advancing on our left toward Mission Ridge. Our pickets drove in the pickets of the enemy, and during that day and the 24th we remained in the same position.

On the 25th, the division was ordered to the left, and at 1 p. m. took position on the left of the Fourth Army Corps, my brigade being on the left of Beatty's brigade, Wood's division. As was afterward ascertained, the order was that, at the signal of six guns fired in succession, the whole line of the center, including our division, would advance and storm the enemy's position on Mission Ridge, but the order was brought to our division after the guns were fired, and some troops of General Sheridan's division on the extreme right were storming the ridge when we commenced to advance, which was a little after 3 p. m.

I had the first line (Eleventh, Thirty-sixth, and Ninety-second Ohio) deployed, and the second line (Seventeenth, Thirty-first, and Eighty-ninth Ohio and Eighty-second Indiana) in double column at half distance. The last two, being small regiments, were formed in one column. Thick underbrush, Citico Creek, and the rebel riflepits impeded considerably the movement of my first line, so that when it had passed through the woods to the edge of the clearing between the woods and the foot of the ridge, other brigades on my right and left were already crossing the clearing, advancing toward the ridge. I halted my brigade for a moment, and saw at once that the space between the woods and the ridge was under a cross-fire of powerful rebel batteries on the ridge, on the right and left, and the rebel skirmishers, partly in rifle-pits at the foot of the ridge and partly on the slope of the hill on our front. I saw General Beatty's
