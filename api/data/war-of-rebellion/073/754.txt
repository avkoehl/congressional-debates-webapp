About an hour and a half ago the enemy made an attack all along my line, the most stubborn and persistent one I have seen them make during this campaign. They are all fighting, dismounted, in the timber, and I can't tell whether they are infantry or cavalry. I judge them to be dismounted cavalry, however, as there are two divisions in our front, and one brigade on our left and rear at the creek, near the junction of the Acworth and Allatoona roads. Should a serious attack be made with infantry, I regard my force as totally inadequate to hold a position of such importance as I believe this to be. Stoneman, I think, is some place on my right. My line is formed on the Marietta road, facing due southeast. I shall hold this road as long as I can, and not be controlled in my movements by the movements of our infantry. I believe the general commanding does not appreciate the importance of it, with all their cavalry in our front. If this road is left open, or they force a passage through my lines, as they are now attempting to do, they will have uninterrupted access to all our trains, hospitals, and the rear of our whole infantry line. When we get through with this skirmish i will send you the result. Colonel Brownlow sent word to General King that they were pressing our line pretty hard. He replied that he could expect no infantry re-enforcements in any emergency. I hope there may be no necessity for asking any. Should there be, I will transmit my request through the proper channels, in order that, as at Dandridge, I may receive them after the need has passed.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. M. McCOOK,

Colonel, Commanding.

GENERAL: I have just passed all along my line from right to left. Everything is all right, and our line occupies the proper relative position to the infantry. General Carlin opened some guns on the enemy, which stopped the skirmishing. The report concerning a movement on our left was false, though I was led to believe it from their attacking my front so determinedly, and at the same time skirmishing heavily with our infantry. I will feel them at sunrise, and advise you at once of the result.

The enemy kept up an incessant fire upon my men from 9 o'clock last night until daylight this morning. My men were not permitted to reply, but reserved their fire for the nearer approach of the enemy. Their fire was without any result, except keeping my whole command awake all night. I could not see their object.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. M. McCOOK,

Colonel, Commanding.

Brigadier General W. L. ELLIOTT.
