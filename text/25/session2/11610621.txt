Sn there is another feature of this measure which deceives
csn^idnation This subject was not new to the Piesident It
had received his careful examination and full dehbeiation on %
former occasion Inl82b3when he stool upon thib fixu as a
Senator from the State of New Yoik, he maintained on this
subject the same pi maples which I am now end* avoñug to
maintain He then represented all the great mteie^ts of the
State, as 1 am now attempting !o ippie«ent ihem The bank

the Constitution" and, m 1SÍ7 President Van Buren pi o
poses uaumform Law concerning bankruptcies of cotpo)a
tions, andolhPr banket s," as, a measure "fully authonzed by
the Constitution" Now, sir peinut me toask, if such arnti
suie was unconstitutional! i 1826, can the rccommen'ation of
the President make it constitutional m 1837? 1 think not unlcsb
the Constitution changes as the party changes ' But, wht tliei
it does or not, is immaterial to the piesent question The Pr<-
sident recommended a bankiupt J twin itteience to banking
incorporations He must have íeviewed his lormei opn ion&
onthatsuhaeot He must have deemed the cr sis so mportant
as to overcome his old constitutional scruples, and th it it was
now "necessary and expedient" that buch a law should pass
and thereby rid the countiy of (he curse of paper money and
thus restore the "constitutional cuirency" of gold and silver
Mr President, I have said that the people believed the design
of the -Idmimstr ition and Ufe prominent friends was to destroy
the banking institutions of the States They foie aw what
would have been the effect of the adoption of the bankrupt Jaw
They also''aw, and still see, the effect of tht bub Treasuiv
acceme They know that both are equally fatal Ihey saw
the manner in which the Sub Treasury was uiged nt the extra
session Tkey saw by the official otgan thaf,af(ei it was.de
featedmthe House, it was again tobe forced upon Congress at
the present session, and they see cieirly now that its adoption
at this time will be a* fatal to die banks as a bankrupt law would
have been before Its adoption "would prevent tht resumption of
specie payments Or, if the bank-* should resume, itw ould c< m
pel them to step again Or, if they continued to pay specie, it j
iyo!$l ¿>e merely a nominal thing, and they could do no busi     |
