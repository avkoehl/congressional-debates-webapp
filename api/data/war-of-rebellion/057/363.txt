P. S. - I send this by courier, as the telegraph is not working yet. The advance of the enemy was at Tallahatta Creek most of the day, where they were repairing the bridge. I am cooking rations here, and am opposite their advance. A scout just from Decatur reports rear guard of enemy (cavalry) in Decatur at 12.30 to-day. Can you furnish any horses for dismounted men? There are a number of dismounted men in Meridian who might be mounted and sent out.

Yours, respectfully,

S. D. LEE,

Major-General.

CHUNKY'S STATION,

February 13, 1864.

GENERAL: I was compelled to send Waties' battery to the rear to Enterprise, as horses and men were broken down. He had but 6 horses to a piece and his men on foot. I have but one section with me. Would like to have a good battery, if possible, and the men mounted. Croft's battery was loaned to Ferguson, and he sent it to Meridian. Would like that battery to join also. I send this by an officer, who will explain.

I am, general, yours, respectfully,

S. D. LEE,

Major-General.

Lieutenant-General POLK,

Commanding.

ALAMUTCHE, February 17, 1864-7.20 p.m.

Received your dispatch inclosing Forrest's telegrams. Jackson, with Ross and Starke, is now in position on Mobile and Ohio Railroad, above Lauderdale Springs. Will move with Ferguson to-morrow morning, and Adams will follow. Will leave one regiment to cover Demopolis. The enemy have been engaged tearing up railroad to-day above Meridian. Have not heard from below yet; hope to hear to-night. Enemy have as yet indicated no certain direction from Meridian. Prisoners taken to-day say that talk in camp is that they are to return to Vicksburg. Will dispatch again to-night.

SEVEN MILES EAST OF LAUDERDALE SPRINGS,

February 18, 1864-8.15 p.m.

I am here to-night. Will leave in the morning for Scooba Station. Enemy still quietly encamped at Old Marion. Have not worked on railroad to-day. They are evidently prepared for a move, but in what direction I cannot say. There is at least a division there and two regiments of cavalry. Have heard nothing from below Meridian to-day,nor from General Forrest.

S. D. LEE,

Major-General.

Lieutenant General L. POLK.
