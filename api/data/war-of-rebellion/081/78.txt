GARRETT,

Sergeant, Signal Corps.

SIGNAL TOWER, June 15, 1864-4.30 p.m.

[Captain L. B. NORTON:]

CAPTAIN: I am a little puzzled about the situation at present. The enemy's battery which was at work while you were here is apparently silenced, but there was another opened in the edge of the city, directly over the nearest rebel signal station from this place. There is also a heavy fight going on in a direction due south from here; artillery and musketry are in use. The rebel line of battle can be seen.

CRAFT,

Signal Officer.

Captain G. S. DANA,

Signal Officer, Headquarters Tenth Army Corps:

It is reported that Lee's army is moving up the north bank of James River, between Malvern Hill and Chaffin's Bluff, and crossing the river at the latter point. Look out for them. I have communication with the Army of the Potomac.

NORTON,

Captain.

Colonel J. W. SHAFFER,

Chief of Staff:

COLONEL: I have the honor to state that the signal officer at General Terry's headquarters reports that at 6 p.m he observed one regiment of infantry crossing Chaffin's Bluff and another at 6.20 p.m with wagons looking like pontoons.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

L. B. NORTON,

Captain and Chief Signal Officer.

P. S.-The signal officer at the tower reports that he sees nothing of Hancock's troops unless his is the force still engaged in a line due south from the tower. The battery on the outskirts of Petersburg has ceased firing.
