Major THOMAS T. ECKERT:

General Sherman's headquarters to-night ten miles from here. McPherson reached railroad at Acworth, and Thomas is four miles west at the Burnt Church. Johnston fell back to strong position in front of Marietta. The officer in charge of repairs of railroad says will take ten days from to-day to rebuild bridge over Etowah, but pontoon train has gone there, and will lay a bridge there to-morrow. I shall be at front. Army will rest now.
