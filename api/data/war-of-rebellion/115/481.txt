Honorable WILLIAM H. SEWARD, Secretary of State.

SIR: Your letter of the 24th insstant in relation to the testimony in the Serrill case was this morning received. I wrote on the 23rd instant as requested by your favor of the 22nd and received on the day when I answered it. I inclose a copy of my communication of the 23rd instant which will place in your hands all the information under my control. Should you desire any inquireis instituted in this city my services will be cheerfully at your disposal.

DEPARMTNE OF STATE, Washington, August 27, 1861.

E. DELAFIELD SMITH, Esq.,

U. S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York.

SIR: Your letter of the 23rd instant relative to the case of Serill, a prisoner at Fort Lafayette, has been received. The facts and the references mentioned in your communication go far toward making out a strong prima facie case against Serrill. On the other hand a letter* to the Department of the 22nd instant from Clarkson N. Potter, of New York, and other papers* tending to exculpate the prosoner are herewith inclose. it must be confessed that these in a measure at least must be allowed to counteract the adverse testimony. With a view, however, to thorow further light on the case the Secretary wishes that you would yourself or that you wold request mr. Evarts to proceed to Fort Lafayette, examine Serrill in connection with the proof on both sides, take down the examination in writing and forward it hither with the papers, in order that the expediency of further detaining him may be determined.

I am, sir, your obedient servant,

F. W. SEWARD,

Assistant Secretary.
