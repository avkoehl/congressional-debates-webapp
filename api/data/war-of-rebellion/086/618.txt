LITTLE ROCK, November 19, 1864.

Brigadier General C. C. ANDREWS,

Commanding, Devall's Bluff:

Yours just received. Let the boats go with guards on each boat. The Emma's freight might be discharged at Pine Bluff, and return immediately. The roads are so bad out from Pine Bluff now that they cannot send for forage. I leave the armament of the boats to your won discretion. We do not know of any rebel troops near the Arkansas below here. Clayton will reconnoiter.

F. STEELE,

Major-General.
HDQRS. SECOND DIVISION, SEVENTH ARMY CORPS,Devall's Bluff, Ark., November 19, 1864-6 p. m.

Major General F. STEELE,

Little Rock:

I think the Tempest, Live Oak, and Eclipse will be wooded up so as to start at daylight. The Emma will take on about 500 boxes of clothing from wharf-boat to make up a full load, and be ready at 10 a. m. to-morrow. You speak of he stopping at Pine Bluff. She has no forage.

C. C. ANDREWS,

Brigadier-General.
HDQRS. SECOND DIVISION, SEVENTH ARMY CORPS,Devall's Bluff, Ark., November 19, 1864.

Captain C. H. GAUBERT,

Assistant Quartermaster:

Have the Tempest, Eclipse, and Live Oak start back and go up the Arkansas as soon as they can wood up and take on the guards. Send the Emma. If you can, conveniently, put on the stores you spoke of. The fact of their going must be kept secret, and you will caution the captains of the boats. The Emma can discharge her cargo at Pine Bluff and go back. Let me know how soon each boat will be ready for the guards to embark.

Respectfully,

C. C. ANDREWS,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Lieutenant-Colonel Knight's command left for Little Rock yesterday at 2 p. m. Colonel Sackett and party are waiting for a boat. The raid on our board party resulted in the wounding of one of our men. Our men formed line in their shirts, drove the rebels back, wounding Rev. Parson Farish, who it is supposed was piloting the jayhawkers. Farish is in the hospital a prisoner. River at a stand.

Colonel, Commanding.
