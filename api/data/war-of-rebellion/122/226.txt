By a dispatch dated May 6 I was authorized to accept them for three years. I now tender them, and want instructions sent to the mustering officers.

The four regiments in the last call will be ready in a few days. Answer by telegraph. Don't delay.

O. P. MORTON,

Governor of Indiana.

INDIANAPOLIS, IND., May 22, 1861.

Honorable DAVIS KILGORE:

By an agreement gotten up with two or three colonels, Colfax has gone on to tender the six regiments of three months' men for three years. This could only be done properly by the Governor. The attempt is to supersede me with the men and officers. He will be there to-morrow morning. Push the matter I gave you in charge by the former dispatch.

O. P. MORTON,

Governor of Indiana.

WASHINGTON, May 22, 1861.
