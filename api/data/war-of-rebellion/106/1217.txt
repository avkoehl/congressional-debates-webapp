HEADQUARTERS,Fort Walla Walla, Wash. Ter., April 30, 1865.

ACTING ASSISTANT ADJUTANT-GENERAL,

Hdqrs. District of Oregon, Fort Vancouver, Wash. Ter.:

SIR: I have the honor to report for the information of the colonel commanding the district that on yesterday evening I returned from Lieutenant Kerns' camp on the Umatilla Indian Agency. The lieutenant has built three small cabins to shelter his men from the storms and sun. Owing to the large herd of miners and traders that is now passing through that reservation, and the light estimate that many of them place upon the Indians' title to their homes, difficulties between the whites and Indians are almost of daily occurrence. None have as yet assumed a serious turn, but in order to render the Indians there securely quiet, it is my opinion that at least one copany should be camped there until the present throng of tavelers had diminished, or found some other line of ingress and egress to the mining regions beyond. While troulbes from the travelers aredaily, each individual case requiring immediate attention, another and more important consideration is the disposition on the part of quite a number of the squatters around the borders of the reservation to create serious truble with the Indians, desiring as a result the frocible expulsion of the Indians from the reserve, and the land now occupied by the Indians be declared open for settlement by the whites. As a timely preventative and wholesome check upon the cupidity of the whites, it seems to me advisable to have a company placed in temporary huts there; the expense would amount to but a trifle compared with the mischief it would ost probably prevent.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. B. CURREY,

Lieutenant-Colonel First Oregon Infantry, Commanding Post.
